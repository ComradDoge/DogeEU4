 # Missions:
 madagascar_statebuilding_title: "Create a State"
 madagascar_statebuilding_desc: "We are a people. Nothing more. Some may deign to call us a tribe, but we know better. However, in an increasingly complex world, we cannot afford to remain defenseless. The Swahili Coast to the west offers lucurative trade opportunities, which we could very well capitalize on. First, we simply need to become a state."
 madagascar_leadership_title: "Adequate Leadership"
 madagascar_leadership_desc: "Perhaps one man to lead a nation is not enough. Delegation in the form of advisors must be achieved in order to expedite the process of administration."
 madagascar_rebirth_title: "Madagascar Rebirth"
 madagascar_rebirth_desc: "On both a technological and cultural level, Madagascar is not what it used to be. Before we can truly become a modern nation, we must first undergo our own rebirth."
 madagascar_west_title: "The West Coast"
 madagascar_west_desc: "On the west lies the Sakalava people, a hardy people of relatively direct Bantu ancestry. The area itself is relatively valuable, and will provide a decent point for ventures on the African continent."
 madagascar_tides_title: "The Changing Tides"
 madagascar_tides_desc: "For centuries, our island has allowed for a multicultural people to live in harmony, but unrest and war stirs among the tribes. We prepare to attack or be attacked ourself."
 madagascar_highlands_title: "The Highlands"
 madagascar_highlands_desc: "In central Madagascar lies the Highlands: rolling hills, perfect for defense. If we wish to survive on this cruel rock, we must take these fortifications before they are used against us."
 madagascar_south_title: "Southern Tip"
 madagascar_south_desc: "The apex of Madagascar lies in the southern tip; a mix of cultures, environments, and peoples. To truly unite Madagascar, this region must be ours."
 madagascar_europe_title: "European Debacle"
 madagascar_europe_desc: "We have met people that believe "African Civilization" is an oxymoron, and we are no exception to their dumbfounding rule. Although they are mighty, we can hold strong by preventing them from reaching us."
 madagascar_north_title: "Northern Tip"
 madagascar_north_desc: "An exemplary trading center, the northern and eastern coasts of Madagascar would provide us with great wealth if utilized correctly. We should begin taking advantage of the region by first conquering it."
 madagascar_faith_title: "Solace of Faith"
 madagascar_faith_desc: "The island of Madagascar hosts a plethora of religions, the majority of which originated here. However, there lies an outlier. On the southeastern shore of our island lies a flicker of a new faith, worshipping one God as the Divine Creator. We know nothing of this, but it sounds interesting. In the meantime, we might as well work towards the establishment of a unified faith."
 madagascar_zeal_title: "Religious Zeal"
 madagascar_zeal_desc: "Of course, such a faith cannot stay contained. It must be propagated beyond our borders to ensure its longevity and the salvation of our neighbors. Such a faith is only right."
 madagascar_swahili_title: "Swahili Commerce"
 madagascar_swahili_desc: "The Islamic Swahili Coast consistently offers us non-beneficial deals, each amounting to a major detriment to our economy. This cannot stand, thus we must dominate trade and set the rules ourselves."
