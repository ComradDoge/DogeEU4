First, we simply need to become a state."

On the southeastern shore of our island lies a flicker of a new faith, worshipping one God as the Divine Creator. We know nothing of this, but it sounds interesting. In the meantime, we might as well work towards the establishment of a unified faith."
 madagascar_zeal_title: "Religious Zeal"
