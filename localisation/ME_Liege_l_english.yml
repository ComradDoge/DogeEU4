 ME_Liege_Events.1.t: "The Happy Revolution"
 ME_Liege_Events.1.d: "The 'Liege Revolution' also known as the 'Happy Revolution' was a revolution that occured in Liege on 18th of August 1791. The revolutionaries managed to drive out the Prince-Bishop and to proclaim a Republic as per Enlightenment ideals. An imperial intervention soon followed and the Austrian imperial forces overwhelmed the Democrats and the Prince-Bishopric was reinstated, leaving much resentment behind. That resentment manifested itself when the french forces advanced to Liege years later, and Liege took a plebiscite to be integrated into the new French Republic."
 ME_Liege_Events.1.a: "Embrace this movement in full swing."
 ME_Liege_Events.1.b: "No need."
 
 ME_Liege_Events.2.t: "Growth of Weapon Manufacturing"
 ME_Liege_Events.2.d: "In its latter years, Liege's position and economical opportunities have lent itself to the ability to become a center of Weapons Manufacturing. Should we let this happen, our current industry will be forced out and we will have to conform to the new realities."
 ME_Liege_Events.2.a: "Promote this endeavour."
 ME_Liege_Events.2.b: "Focus on draining funds from the populace."

Surrounded by powerful foes trying to keep us weak, we have finally managed to find our resolve in order to prosper. Having united much of the southern Low Countries, we have truly reclaimed the glory of the ancient Belgae people. With such circumstance, we have decided to proclaim the state of [Root.GetName], a new power on the rise in Western Europe and an economic superpower whose presence shall not be ignored on the international stage."
 ME_Liege_Events.3.a: "Ô Belgique!"

 ME_Liege_Events.5.t: "Strategic City of [93.GetName]"
 ME_Liege_Events.5.d: "The strategic city of [93.GetName] is perhaps our greatest obstacle and the single impediment to becoming the true lords of the Netherlands. Its position leaves our flank exposes and the Prince-Bishop has been bestowed with many powers, including but not limited to the title of 'Advocatus Brabanconne', allowing them to siphon funds from us. However, the country's theocratic nature allows us to meddle in their affairs with a little bit of papal bribery and politics."
 ME_Liege_Events.5.a: "Use our papal connections to subdue them from within."
 ME_Liege_Events.5.b: "This isn't good. No good. No good at all."
 
 ME_Liege_Events.6.t: "Burgundians Meddling in our Affairs"
 ME_Liege_Events.6.d: "It was bound to happen eventually, but the [From.GetName] have finally made a move against us. And what a move it is, for they have decided to use their influence in the curia for most wicked of reasons, using the papal investiture to appoint their own candidate on our throne. What an elegant way to supress an enemy, it shall be seen if their candidate even gets to rule in the first place, for no mere citizen of [Root.GetName] is willing to be ruled by corrupt foe."
 ME_Liege_Events.6.a: "There's always a bigger fish."

 ME_Liege_Events.7.t: "Liège Wars"
 ME_Liege_Events.7.d: "Our opposition to the 'Papal' will should have been expected by our foes. No amount of corruption in the curia will make us give up our independence to an underhanded foe like the [BUR.GetAdjective]s. Seeing the events unfold like that, our enemies have decided to declare war on us to impose the new candidate themselves.\n\nWith sights on an overwhelming foe like this, the one consolation, hope and symbol of our resolve is the [Root.GetAdjective] Perron in the middle of [93.GetName], the tower that unites us all."
 ME_Liege_Events.7.a: "We must defend our Tower at all costs!"
 
 ME_Liege_Events.8.t: "Sack of [93.GetName]"
 ME_Liege_Events.8.d: "No amount of heroic resolve and desperate struggle is able to withstand the might of our armies. Those fiends in [LIE.GetName] have finally gotten what they received, for we have managed to break into their capital city and the imposition of our candidate in the city is truly nigh. The city shall come under our vassalage in due time."
 ME_Liege_Events.8.a: "And we will take the Perron too!"
