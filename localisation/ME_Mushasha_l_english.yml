 ME_Mushasha_Events.1.t: "Muhammad ibn Falah the Mahdi" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.1.d: "Our spiritual and de facto leader is [Root.Monarch.GetName], a Wasit born theologian who studied in al-Hillah, who is yet so different to all of his peers. It was there, in Hillah, that he recognized that he is the embodiment of the prophecied representative of Imam Ali, the Mahdi. As such, in fervor of his grand quest to fulfill the prophecies, he founded the Musha'sha', an order where the Mahdi's followers were to rid the world of evil. It has been a few years since the founding of the order, and, by Allah, we will fulfill our greater purpose." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.1.a: "Long may he reign!" 
  
 ME_Mushasha_Events.2.t: "Capture of Najaf" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.2.d: "The Najaf is the most significant holy city unique to all Shi'ites. Its importance stems from the tombs of Imam Ali, located in the city. The Imam Ali, whose embodied currently in Muhammad ibn Falah. However, contrary to what may be expected, Najaf isn't inhabited exclusively by the followers of Falah, or even his previous body. Our forces, lead by imam [Root.Monarch.GetName], have already tried to put many to the sword. But is it a righteous act, though?" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.2.a: "Massacre the Unbelievers! Leave only the faithful." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.2.b: "The Mahdi did not come to incite violence." 
  
 ME_Mushasha_Events.3.t: "The Holy Cities of Ali" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.3.d: "The holy cities of Najaf and Kufah are finally recaptured. To celebrate this monumental victory, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken a pilgrimage from Kufah to Najaf along the route where Imam Ali's body was allegedly taken. With this show of piety and honor, it would seem that the two cities would be given utmost attention from the Mushasha order. And yet, the order is deeply in debt due to constant war and the unwillingness of bankers to give loans to the order." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.3.a: "We will upkeep the holy cities." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.3.b: "We cannot spend any more funds!" 
  
 ME_Mushasha_Events.4.t: "The Mountain Passes" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.4.d: "With the reconquest of the Luri territories, the mountain passes previously guarded by the local tribes now remain empty and defenseless. However, with several defensible positions, we might be able to raise a one central fortification that would oversee the passages from above. That way, we need not send soldiers guarding each pass simultaneously." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.4.a: "Guard the Pass in [2217.GetName]." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.4.b: "Put down a fortress in [4342.GetName]." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.4.c: "Reinforce [413.GetName]." 
  
 ME_Mushasha_Events.5.t: "Cities Across the Zagros" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.5.d: "As we inch into Persia, we are entering territories seemingly loyal, yet largely defiant Iranian population. Though many locals are followers of Ali, many still deny the ibn Falah's occultation. Furthermore, their terrories lie far beyond the mighty Zagros peaks, making that region difficult to keep under control. We might want to reconsider our ambitions there." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.5.a: "Establish a Satrapy!" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.5.b: "Let us inch ever closer to the Zagros."

 ME_Mushasha_Events.7.t: "Leaders of the Order" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.7.d: "Due to the nature of our order, any forms of deviation from zealotry and ultimate loyalty to the Sheikh are repressed. As such, it is becoming the rule, that our leaders are largely zealous. Currently it seems to be a good thing, but our policy might change and by then it might be too late." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.7.a: "Faithful zealotry is a bliss." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.7.b: "Alright."

 ME_Mushasha_Events.8.t: "Fate of the Musha'sha" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.8.d: "The freezing news arrived earlier that day. The court has had long expected this day would come, but never believed it actually would. Now, as the news are finally here, they must decide what shall happen next. Of course, it is obvious that the heir must be chosen and the order must continue. However, many were under the impression that the Mahdi would only leave this world when his will is done. The rumors of the death are already spreading among the scholars of the state, who might soon cast doubt upon our theology if nothing is done." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.8.a: "He may have left us, but we are far from done!" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.8.b: "We must bide our time and seek to finish our ambitions." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.8.c: "Perhaps he wasn't the Mahdi after all?" 
  
 ME_Mushasha_Events.9.t: "Sugar Plantations" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.9.d: "Her lips aflow with sweet sugar,\nThe sweet sugar that aflows in Khuzestan.\n\nKhuzestan and its sugar has grown far beyond notoriety. It has earned its sppt in the culture of Persia, as its fields have gained an association with sweetness. It is why, then, many that had come before us decided to double down on relying on sugar production. We could, of course, be an exception, but should we?" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.9.a: "By all means, encourage further plantations." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.9.b: "We must diversify our economy." 
  
 ME_Mushasha_Events.10.t: "Growing Availability of Sugar in Middle East" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.10.d: "With an increasing production of Sugar in Khuzestan and Morocco, the households of the Middle East have been getting increasingly more supplied with sugar, raising its fame and demand, further increasing our profits of ours and of anyone who can sell their sugar to the arab world. With how globalized the sugar economy is though, that amounted to a global price increase." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.10.a: "Sounds Good!" 
  
 ME_Mushasha_Events.11.t: "The End Has Come!" 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.11.d: "Upon the death of the Mahdi, we have chosen to continue his quest with utmost valor and fervor. And yet, despite many successes,  our population has grown doubtful of the claim that Muhammad ibn Falah truly was the Mahdi. At this point, it doesn't matter whether it was true or not, as our realm is about to collapse due to the general skepticism. Generations raised and converted to the belief in ibn Falah are greatly disappointed and seek a remedy." 
 ME_Mushasha_Events.11.a: "Looks like the Empire Mahdi built was destined to fall."
