 malankara_religion_desc: "According to tradition, the church originated in the missions of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Part of Oriental Orthodoxy, it is one of the oldest Christian communities in Asia."
 celtic_religion_desc: "The Druids, an ancient Indo-European people, reached the apogee of their influence and territorial expansion during the 4th century bc, extending across the length of Europe from Britain to Asia Minor. From the 3rd century bc onward their history is one of decline and disintegration, and with Julius Caesar’s conquest of Gaul (58–51 bc) Celtic independence came to an end on the European continent. In Britain and Ireland this decline moved more slowly, but traditional culture was gradually eroded through the pressures of political subjugation; today the Celtic languages are spoken only on the western periphery of Europe, in restricted areas of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany (in this last instance largely as a result of immigration from Britain from the 4th to the 7th century ad). It is not surprising, therefore, that the unsettled and uneven history of the Celts has affected the documentation of their culture and religion."
 mazdaki_religion_desc: "Mazdak was a Zoroastrian priest who claimed to be a prophet of Ahura Mazda. He attempted to reform the religion with Gnostic elements, and advocated communal possessions and welfare programs."

 zun_pagan_reformed_religion_desc: "Zun, the Sun-God and Giver of Justice, embodies wisdom, power, fire and the light that drives away the night. The reformed Zun faith has a Holy Book detailing things such as the creation myths and outlining church doctrine, as well as a standardized liturgy and a formal church hierarchy led by the High Priest."
 hellenic_pagan_religion_desc: "The Hellenistic religion is polytheistic, with a pantheon of twelve major gods including Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Minerva and Vesta. It originated in ancient Greece and with the conquests of Alexander the Great and the Roman Empire, it would go on to become the dominant religion in the Mediterranean world until the rise of Christendom."

The nominal head of the Monothelite Church is the Monothelite Patriarch of Antioch."
 iconoclast_religion_desc: "The Iconoclast heresy plagued the Byzantine Empire in multiple waves. Iconoclasts believe that religious images - icons and depictions of holy figures in particular - are a form of idolatry and must not be allowed. In their heyday, iconoclasts destroyed innumerable such decorations and icons, sometimes even urged on by Iconoclast Emperors."
