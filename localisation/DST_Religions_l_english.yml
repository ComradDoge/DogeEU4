 #Religion Description
 celtic_religion_desc: "The Druids, an ancient Indo-European people, reached the apogee of their influence and territorial expansion during the 4th century bc, extending across the length of Europe from Britain to Asia Minor. From the 3rd century bc onward their history is one of decline and disintegration, and with Julius Caesar’s conquest of Gaul (58–51 bc) Celtic independence came to an end on the European continent. In Britain and Ireland this decline moved more slowly, but traditional culture was gradually eroded through the pressures of political subjugation; today the Celtic languages are spoken only on the western periphery of Europe, in restricted areas of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany (in this last instance largely as a result of immigration from Britain from the 4th to the 7th century ad). It is not surprising, therefore, that the unsettled and uneven history of the Celts has affected the documentation of their culture and religion."

 zun_pagan_reformed_religion_desc: "Zun, the Sun-God and Giver of Justice, embodies wisdom, power, fire and the light that drives away the night. The reformed Zun faith has a Holy Book detailing things such as the creation myths and outlining church doctrine, as well as a standardized liturgy and a formal church hierarchy led by the High Priest."
