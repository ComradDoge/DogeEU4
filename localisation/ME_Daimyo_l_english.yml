 # Events:
 ME_Daimyo_Events.1.t: "Ashikaga Succession Crisis"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.1.d: "The crippling lack of heir for the position of the Shogun has lead the current titleholder, [ASK.Monarch.GetTitle] [ASK.Monarch.GetName], to have convinced his younger brother Ashikaga Yoshimi, who was leading a life of a monk at the time of the request, to abandon his current lifestyle and become his heir. A year later, the wife of the Shogun has given birth to a male heir, whose claim is being supported by the influential Seishitsu. [HSK.Monarch.GetName], having been a long friend of Yoshimi, is leading a considerable campaign against their arch-nemesis, [YMN.GetName] clan, who are in support of the young child. This event might mark the beginning of a new era."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.1.a: "This will hurt our authority!"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.2.a: "The Shogun will lose much authority"
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.3.t: "Shogun's Deputy"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.3.d: "Through careful diplomatic moves and our impeccable show of power, we have managed to impress the shogun and persuade him to grant [Root.Monarch.GetName] the title of Kyoto Kanrei - the Deputy of Shogun in the Kyoto area."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.3.a: "Splendid!"
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.4.t: "Treachery of [From.GetName]"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.4.d: "Thanks to the treacherous acts of [From.GetName], Shogun has cede our position of Kanrei to the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] effectively making us nothing more than a mere daimyo. Their treachery will not be forgotten and our title will be retrieved!"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.4.a: "Damnation!"
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.5.t: "Shogun's Deputy"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.5.d: "Through careful diplomatic moves and our impeccable show of power, we have managed to impress the shogun and persuade him to grant [Root.Monarch.GetName] the title of Kanto Kanrei - the Deputy of Shogun in the Kanto area."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.5.a: "Splendid!"
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.6.t: "Treachery of [From.GetName]"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.6.d: "Thanks to the treacherous acts of [From.GetName], Shogun has cede our position of Kanrei to the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] effectively making us nothing more than a mere daimyo. Their treachery will not be forgotten and our title will be retrieved!"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.6.a: "Damnation!"
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.7.t: "Propagation of Buddhism"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.7.d: "China has long since influenced Japanese culture, offering linguistic and cultural inspiration for us to refine. It would seem as though religious institutions are starting to take hold here as well. A new faith is taking root in Japan, know simply as the Ikko Ikki, warrior monks owing allegiance to the Buddha. Though we needn't worry about the Daimyos betraying the Kami for a new deity, the peasantry and some clerical institutions seem to have already converted to Buddhism."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.7.a: "We shall embrace these ideals!"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.7.b: "Try to limit their spread."
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.8.t: "Onset of the War"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.8.d: "Sunrise transitions to sunset as the banners of war are held high. What rises above the hills is not the moon, but a ravenous army, prepared to bring death to its enemy. As conscription increases, so too does the frequency of border skirmishes, skyrocketing tensions between [HSK.GetName] and [YMN.GetName]. It seems as though there shall be no peaceful resolution to this conflict. The sun has set on the Muromachi era, and we must prepare for the long darkness that follows."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.8.a: "To Arms!"
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.9.t: "The Struggle for Support"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.9.d: "The two factions of @YMN[YMN.GetName] and @HSK[HSK.GetName] are vying for supporters in their diplomatic struggle. One can't predict what will come out of this, however one thing is certain: it will shake the shogunate and define the future of the Japanese Islands."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.9.a: "Neutrality is key"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.9.b: "We shall support @HSK[HSK.GetName]"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.9.c: "@YMN[YMN.GetName] is the right choice."
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.10.t: "[From.GetName] Revokes Support"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.10.d: "The cowardly [From.GetName] has gone back on their word and withdrawn all military support to us. This betrayal shall not be forgotten."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.10.a: "We don't need the likes of them."
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.11.t: "[From.GetName] Offers Support"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.11.d: "The wise and honorable [From.GetName] has offered their full support in these trying times. This kindness shall not go unnoticed."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.11.a: "They have chosen wisely."
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.12.t: "Beginning of the War"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.12.d: "Philosophy dictates that the natural cycle of man is conflict followed by peace. However, this notion seems irrelevant in the face of endless slaughter. The armies of the Sunrise Kingdom are bolstered with swathes of peasants, to a point beyond any preconceived limit of military might. A century of prosperity under the Ashikaga has led to rich Daimyos with naught to do but amass power. If an unstoppable spear meets an immovable shield, a truce must be had, but there is no precedent for the union of two unstoppable spears. All that can be predicted is their color: a shade of crimson red."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.12.a: "So it begins..."

 ME_Daimyo_Events.13.a: "Our time has come"
 
 ME_Daimyo_Events.15.t: "Instituting Own Laws"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.15.d: "With time passing, the average daimyo is getting more and more control over his lands. This gradual weakening of the Shogun authority is leading to the strongest daimyos appoint local laws for themselves. Currently, that level of autonomy is perfectly viable for us and henceforth, we may appoint new laws with little fears of retaliation."
 ME_Daimyo_Events.15.a: "Reform our Taxation"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.15.b: "Create an Elaborate Drafting Policy"
 ME_Daimyo_Events.15.c: "Play up to the Shogun"
