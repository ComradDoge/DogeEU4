 # Hellenic Flavour | Neprut

 dse_hellenic_flavour.1.t: "Millennial Anniversary of Rome"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.1.d: "Based on Roman Mythology, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were born by the joining of their mother, Rhea Silvia, and the god Mars. After their birth, they were forcefully abandoned by the king Amulius in the Tiber river. Through a series of miraculous interventions, the river carried them to a she-wolf and woodpecker who nurtured them until they were taken in by a shepherd and his wife. Once the boys reached maturity, they learned of their origins, killed Amulius, and went on to found a new city. The two brothers quarrled over the location until Remus was killed. The city of Rome was then created, named after Romulus, on the 21st of April 753BC. Now, the one thousand year annivesary of the founding of Rome has dawned upon us, and the nation celebrates its long history."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.1.a: "The city of Rome shall have a large celebration."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.1.b: "Let us extend the celebration to the entire country."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.2.t: "Secular Games"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.2.d: "The Secular Games were an originally pagan holiday that involved sacrifices and theatrical performances. Held in Rome, it marked the end of a saeculum and the beginning of the next. A saeculum was the longest length of human life, ranging between 100 and 110 years. Celebrations were traced as far back as 509BC and continued until the christianization of the Empire."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.2.a: "Make this the biggest festival in all of history!"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.2.b: "The Secular Games will be remembered for centuries!"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.2.c: "Let us begin the Secular Games."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.2.e: "Now is not the time for games."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.3.t: "Sacrifice To The Gods"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.3.d: "In Latin, sacrificium simply meant the act of making something sacred. In fact, sacrifices to household dieties were common and included giving up things such as fruits, wheat, honey, wine incense, or even food that fell off the dinner table. The most potent sacrifices involved animals. They were first cleansed and then calmed due to the fact that tradition stated that the harmonisation of the earthly and divine was necessary. In other words, the animal needed to willingly offer its life and remain calm throughout its death. There were also recorded instances of human sacrifice during the early period of the Roman Republic, but this practice was officially ruled as murder in 81BC."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.3.a: "Let us give a large sacrifice to the gods."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.3.b: "A medium sacrifice is all that is necessary right now."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.3.c: "We should sacrifice some animals to gain benefits from the gods."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.3.e: "Only a human sacrifice can convince the gods to help us."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.4.t: "College of Pontiffs"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.4.d: "The College of Pontiffs was the instituion of the highest-ranking priests of the state religion. Headed by the Pontifex Maximus, other pontifices, the Rex Sacrorum, the fifteen Flamens, and the Vestals, the college was in charge of advising senate members in religious matters as well as safeguarding the pontifical books. These books contained the lists of invocations and dieties as well as yearly records of magistrates and important events. When Christianity became the religion of the Roman Empire, Pope Leo I used the title Pontifex Maximus to emphasize his authority."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.4.a: "Adhere to the Pontifex Maximus"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.4.b: "Ignore the advice of the College of Pontiffs"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.5.t: "The Augurs"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.5.d: "The Augurs were a group of priests who interpretted the will of the gods through the flight patterns of birds. Things such as the amount and type of birds, as well as the direction and number all played a role in the determination of the prophecy. Recently, an Augur has been traveling across the streets claiming that ill times are ahead based on the most recent flight patters."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.5.a: "Allow the Augur to preach"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.5.b: "His fearmongering shall not be allowed"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.6.t: "The Vestal Virgins"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.6.d: "The Vestal Virgins were a group in Rome composed of two to six virgin women who were priestesses of Vesta, godess of the hearth. They cultivated the sacred fire of Rome and prevented it from extinguishing. If it did, it was considered a sign that the Gods had abandoned Rome. They also kept track of state rituals. They held immense power in the Roman world, allowing for the pardon of Caeser when he was an enemy of the state. The Vestal had to remain virgins for once they accepted the responsibility of their role, they were considered daughters of the state. Thus, if they had any sexual relations with any citizen of Rome, it was considered incest and they were killed for Treason. This group continued to exist until its dissolution in 394 by Christian Emperor Theodius I."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.6.a: "We can better allocate our resources in places besides the Vestals."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.6.b: "The Vestals are wise and should be in power once more."
 dse_hellenic_flavour.7.t: "The Flamines"
 dse_hellenic_flavour.7.d: "A flamen, in the ancient Roman religion, was a priest assigned to one of the fifteen dieties with official cults in the roman empire. The three most important flamines were called the flamines maiores and served the three Roman gods of the Archaic Triad, Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus. There were also twelve other flamines minores who attended the other official cults. On occasion, and especially after the death of Julius Caeser, an imperial cult was set up and governed by one of the flamines maiores. We should choose which cult we should support more."
