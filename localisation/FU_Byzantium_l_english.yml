We must raise a fleet, with haste at that if we wish to beat back the Ottoman heathens and be one step closer to reclaiming our rightful Mediterranean hegemony! "

 byz_ducatus_neapolitanus_desc: "The lands in southern Italia have traditionally belonged to the Basileus in Constantinople, from the great Greek city of Naples to the southern coast of Calabria and Salento where our Greek brothers in faith have resided for millennia! Their eradication and conversion to the Papist sect will not be forgotten, nor forgiven. This will be a great strategic position for our nation, from which we will start reclaiming the ancestral Roman lands, Sicily, the island that fed Italia, the eternal city of Rome and the jewel in the north that the Lombards bastardised into Milan, Mediolanum! "

He shall repent for his sins and be allowed gracefully back into the true Christian faith, in the seat of a Pentarch, where he belongs. "

" 
 byz_citadel_saladin_title: "Citadel of Saladin" 
 byz_citadel_saladin_desc: "Cairo, once called Memphis has persisted trough the ages, it was the most important city in ancient Egypt until Alexandria surpassed it with its importance during the Ptolemaic period and when we took control of it. Its current status of importance has only been established after the Muslim conquest of Egypt and the city as it is, stands against everything we stand for. It is a symbol of rule before and after Greeks and Romans held control of Egypt, it is a symbol of our decline and a symbol of the loss of faith in the region. That being said, it is up to us to choose what we do with it, do we integrate this symbol and make it our own, a symbol of reborn faith, or do we strip it of everything of importance and bring it back to Constantinople as a humiliation to the Citadel of Saladin. " 
 byz_land_atlas_title: "Land of the Atlas" 
 byz_land_atlas_desc: "The people of the Maghreb have been a nuisance for a very long time, raiding along our coasts, enslaving our people, it has got to stop. It just so happens that the Maghreb is the next goal of our reconquest effort, with it being an important stepping stone for further reconquest in the western Mediterranean, it being across a strait from Hispania, as well as being the home of the famous Berber sailors, which will help us in defeating the Spanish armada and landing in Hispania with ease. " 
 byz_pax_iberica_title: "Pax Iberica"
 byz_pax_iberica_desc: "Once again our mighty armies have reached the bountiful coasts of Iberia. A peninsula that once belonged to our mighty Empire a great many centuries ago, now is being picked apart by greedy Spaniards and many prospecting vultures circle its vicinity, eyeing its immense wealth.

 byz_pursue_religious_ideals_desc: "In times of great need, we must rally our people behind strong religious convictions.

Stay true to the vision of God, men of Rome!"
 byz_regulate_state_church_title: "Regulate the State Church" 
 byz_regulate_state_church_desc: "The clerical institutions across every major nation in Europe and beyond have tremendous power. Some have gone as far as to even dispute their monarch's absolute power and attempt his deposition and replacement with a puppet for them to control its strings. Whatever way we may choose, to  earn the clerical allegiance or secure their faith to the crown via the allowance of extended privileges and nepotism, securing their support is of vital importance." 
 byz_haghia_sophia_title: "Hagia Sophia" 
 byz_haghia_sophia_desc: "At the heart of our beautiful citadel of Constantinople, stands proudly one of the largest cathedrals of the entire world and the most prestigious religious centre of Orthodoxy, the Haghia Sophia, aptly known as the Cathedral of Saint Wisdom.

 byz_patriarchate_antioch_desc: "Several major proponents of our creed, centres of religious pragmatism and vital cities of the true faith, have been long lost to the Arabs, after a series of unsuccessful crusades perpetrated by greedy and short-sighted men of the West. It is time we take up the mantle of liberating the first Patriarchate of Antioch!" 
 byz_patriarchate_alexandria_title: "Patriarchate of Alexandria" 
 byz_patriarchate_alexandria_desc: "At the lush top of the Egyptian region lies one of the most ancient and important cities in the entire world. Alexandria has been the host of many conquerors and prospecting strongmen. However, we must save the city not to plunder its wealth and affluence but rather to restore the faithful men of the cloth that once adorned the city." 
 byz_restore_themata_title: "Restore the Theme System" 
 byz_restore_themata_desc: "Centuries of decay and  defeats have resulted in our nation being crumbled and surrounded by all sides.

 byz_prevent_collapse_desc: "Our country is in ruins, our people scattered, our rule questioned, but our hearts are Roman.

Let no one question our rule ever again! Let no one doubt the glory of Rome! " 
 byz_subjugate_bulgars_title: "Subjugate the Bulgars"
 byz_subjugate_bulgars_desc: "The now Slavic Bulgarians to the north have always been a thorn in our side, from endless wars to internal problems. But it wasn't always so, after the conquest of Bulgaria in the 11th century by Basil the Bulgar slayer and a short lived resistance, the Bulgarians were easily integrated into the Roman aristocracy and the empire's administration due to the diplomatic skill of Basil. Now it is up to us, do we want to placate the Bulgarians, potentially never fully integrating them, or do we want to remove the threat they pose forever?  " 
 byz_italia_subirbicaria_title: "Italia Suburbicaria" 
 byz_italia_subirbicaria_desc: "The consolidation of Italia into a single entity occurred during the Roman expansion in the peninsula, when Rome formed a permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities. The strength of the Italian confederacy was a crucial factor in the rise of Rome and just as it was then, it shall be the crucial factor in the Rome's rebirth, as the purple phoenix cannot rise and spread its wings fully without the Domina of Italia and its people, which we will accept back into the Roman fold, as our brothers and sisters, as Romans! " 
 byz_levantine_border_title: "Levantine Border" 
 byz_levantine_border_desc: "The lands of the Levant have been taken from us when the Muslim heathens first showed their faces and since then, there have been a few feeble attempts of retaking it, all failing, or not following through fully, with the city of Antioch changing hands the most. However, now it shall be cemented firmly into our empire and it shall never be let go of, as it is where the hearts of our brethren shall forever be turned to, the pilgrims will forever be safe, under our Roman administration, let no one ever ask, what have the Romans done for them again!

 byz_breadbasket_of_zawarudo_desc: "The Nile delta, arguably one of the most important regions within the old Empire during its golden age, it fed the empire. If you ever heard of the saying "Bread and circuses" rest assured, the chances of that bread being made with grain from the Nile delta were high. It has remained true to this very day, that the grain from the delta feeds the Mediterranean trough trade and it is still commonly called "The Granary of the Mediterranean", however, our ambitions are far greater, and we shall turn the scope of the people being fed from there, from the Mediterranean and into the world. People far, far away shall know that true Roman bread fills their bellies. From true Roman bread for true Romans, to the whole world. " 
 byz_retain_imperial_throne_title: "The Imperial Throne" 
 byz_retain_imperial_throne_desc: "Is a throne legitimate and worth to hold our grip upon even when its power is diminished and it merely relives its past glory ? No!

 byz_demand_crown_allegiance_title: "Crown Allegiance" 
 byz_demand_crown_allegiance_desc: "It is a widely known fact that in many nations across the old continent, many factions inside the court oftentimes have enough influence to manipulate the monarch behind the scenes.

 byz_literary_works_alexandria_desc: "The world's most legendary library, the one dubbed 'Great Library' once hosted hundreds of thousands of manuscripts with knowledge accumulated across the vastness of millennia and stored safely in the archives of Alexandria.

 byz_zupac_rascia_desc: "The Zupa of Rascia was the title originally belonging to the progenitor of the Serbian house of Nemanjic, Stefan Nemanja, who after his betrayal was graciously allowed to remain the Zupan after crawling on all fours and begging the Emperor for forgiveness. After Emperor Manuel's death, Stefan would proclaim himself independent and the Serbian state would remain fiercely so, until now. The Roman mimicking rump state of Serbia shall bend their knee to the Emperor once more. This will be done with relative ease, as they tried to copy our way of ruling trough Dusan's code when they were "an empire", it was based on Roman law and we shall alter it ever so slightly to fit our needs and placate the Serbs forever more.

This is to our enemies, listen to my words and remember them! The empire you wanted to crumble, so you can eat the dry crumbs of legacy and claim our birthright, the empire you wanted to fall so you can rise in its stead, the empire you wanted to forget, that could not be forgotten. That empire has risen, it has risen from the ashes of civil wars and internal turmoil, it has risen from the ashes of foreign conquests, heretics and heathens on all sides, it has risen from betrayal and like a phoenix, we shine with a flame that is no longer extinguishable! We shine with the glory of Rome, with fiery passion in our hearts, we live by the empire and die for the empire! But you, our enemies, you shall die by the empire.

 byz_city_god_title: "City of God" 
 byz_city_god_desc: "Jerusalem, under our control until the 7th century, when it changed hands from Roman to Persian to Roman again and finally Muslim Arab. The city then continued to change hands after numerous crusades and Muslim reconquests, finally, the Mamluks have claimed to be its protectors, custodians of the holy city, but no, they are not. It is the Roman empire that controls it again and we shall protect it once and for all, with the keys of the city finally firmly in our hands, the city will be allowed to prosper and the Patriarch of Jerusalem to return to his sacred position within the city, this is a glorious day for the faithful and with much zeal we will continue to regain rightful Roman land! " 
 byz_aegyptus_title: "Aegyptus"
 byz_aegyptus_desc: "With the old Roman province of Egypt under our control once more, we have a choice to make, will we, as past emperors did, create an administrative subdivision within the empire, creating a Southern Roman Empire, but answering to Constantinople of course, with a loyal relative placed on the throne, or will we handle Egypt directly, as the Eastern Roman Empire did for centuries before the Muslim conquest, providing us with its lucrative trade and production of luxury goods directly. Whatever we choose, one thing is certain, Roman control over Egypt has been reestablished, from the river Nile to Cyrenaica, the Egyptian people are welcomed back into the fold as Romans and the many Christians in the region are starting to show themselves more openly than before, feeling safe within our Christian empire's borders. " 
 byz_presbyter_johannes_title: "Presbyter Johannes" 
 byz_presbyter_johannes_desc: "Said to be a legendary monarch at the edges of the world, Prester John was a man of legends and myth. However, as the wisest crown in the smallest village would often say, there is always a bit of truth with every legend. We have received word that deep in the hills and mountains of an inhospitable continent lies an Empire of Christians detatched from the rest of Christianity. Perhaps marching down there, be it as diplomats or conquerors, is necessary to secure and save these people from neighboring evils." 
 byz_roma_invicta_aeterna_title: "Roma Invicta Aeterna" 
 byz_roma_invicta_aeterna_desc: "An ideal lost in the chambers of time, Rome is nothing but a memory at this point. Or it would be had we not subjugated much of its former territory.

God is with us and with His divine intervention we will attain what is rightfully ours!" 
 byz_embrace_encyclopedism_title: "Embrace Encyclopedism" 
 byz_embrace_encyclopedism_desc: "At the prime of our Empire, the phenomenon of Ecyclopedism, a form of proto-renaissance swept our libraries and monasteries. The production of encyclopedias, the spread of knowledge all assisted in capturing the glory of the past and elevating our population to a better standard of living. Once again, we must reignite the same thirst for knowledge and pursue a prime spot at the hunt for knowledge."
 byz_golden_imperial_era_title: "Golden Imperial Era"
 byz_golden_imperial_era_desc: "Although the Empire is significantly smaller than during the reign of Justinian or previous Roman Emperors, it has regained much strength, as the remaining territories were less geographically dispersed and more politically, economically, and culturally integrated. Expansion of our borders and the restoration of culture and science across the centres of thought in our nation shall lead us to yet another golden era!" 
 byz_house_wisdom_title: "The House of Wisdom"
 byz_house_wisdom_desc: "A shadow of its former self, the libraries of the famed House of Wisdom have stored secrets and methods of the Islamic Golden Age for centuries. Decay, famine and constant wars have led to the once-majestic centre of knowledge to become nothing but a shadow of its former self. Perhaps if it were to come under our jurisdiction we would certainly benefit from it as well as restore its former glory."

 byz_porta_aurea_title: "Porta Aurea" 
 byz_porta_aurea_desc: "Initially built by Constantine the Great, the walls surrounded the new city on all sides, protecting it against attack from both sea and land. As the city grew, the famous double line of the Theodosian Walls was built in the 5th century. Since then, the fortifications around our great capital have fallen into disrepair. It would be wise to make the necessary amends and repair this vital defensive monument." 
 byz_secure_hellespont_title: "Secure the Hellespont" 
 byz_secure_hellespont_desc: "The region of Thrace was always of great strategic importance, controlling one side of the Hellespont and securing it via the fort in Gallipoli, as well as being the location of the crucial city of Adrianople that was taken from us by the Turk heathens where they set up their own capital defiling it! With the retaking of Thrace we will deal a heavy blow to the Ottomans and be one step closer to driving them out of the Balkans and inevitably from Anatolia too! " 
 byz_imperial_bride_title: "The Imperial Bride" 
 byz_imperial_bride_desc: "O Thessaloniki! The Roman people welcome you back into the fold! Named after the sister of Alexander the Great, fitting as you look onward to Alexandria itself, trough your great port. The second capital of our great empire in name, ever failing to fall, until the Turks arrived, the religious bastion of Christendom and Orthodoxy, from whence even the Slavs became Christian trough the works of your citizens Cyril and Methodius. O, great Thessaloniki, you have given us a lot and it is time we give back with the official title of Symvasilevousa, the Co-reigning city and raising you to greatness, only short of the City of the world's desire itself.

 byz_house_osman_desc: "The heathen is on the back foot, we must push this advantage further and further, we will not rest until we rid our rightful lands of the Ottoman filth it became riddled with!

" 
 byz_safeguard_anatolia_title: "Safeguard Anatolia" 
 byz_safeguard_anatolia_desc: "Anatolia has finally fully been returned to its rightful owners! The empire shall work relentlessly on keeping it firmly within our grasp. Returning the proper names to the provinces and distancing them from the Ottoman conquests is a step in the right direction to removing the stain in our history that is this dark time. From this position we can advance the frontier and reconquer rightful Roman lands of Mesopotamia and the Levant further ensuring the safety of our Anatolian heartland!  " 
 byz_cradle_civilization_title: "Cradle of Civilization" 
 byz_cradle_civilization_desc: "Ever since the abandonment of Mesopotamia by Hadrian, due to overextention, it has been an elusive dream of every Roman emperor to be able to achieve success in holding and securing the ancient Roman province once and for all time, however, as opposed to the time of Trajan and Hadrian, this land has a new meaning today, it is the seat of Baghdad, a great citadel of importance for the Muslim world, surely should we take it, the morale of all Muslim people will be shaken, some might even revert to their original true faith, but if not, they will have to be persuaded... by more direct means. " 
 byz_secure_euphrates_title: "Banks of Euphrates" 
 byz_secure_euphrates_desc: "As the Egyptians have their Nile, we have our Danube frontier, so does Mesopotamia have their Euphrates. As one of the most important rivers throughout history, providing fertile soil to the surrounding area, providing trade opportunities that connect the world of the east and west, it has been fought over for millennia, empires lived and died on it, we however, shall make something far greater of it. We shall make the area around it the most prosperous it has ever been, construct great works and make it one of the richest areas within the empire, a true hub for merchants and craftsmen from all around the world.

 byz_heart_of_islam_title: "Heart of Islam" 
 byz_heart_of_islam_desc: ""It is time. With Egypt and the Levant under Roman control the Muslim holy land is within our reach, one must just extend their hand to take it and it shall be me, $MONARCH$. The Muslims took away our holy lands from us, it is time to return the favour, this shall be revenge. Revenge for Jerusalem, revenge for Alexandria, revenge for Antioch, revenge for Mount Athos, revenge in the name of Christ and all Christians!" The speech was held in Constantinople, welcomed with cheers from everyone present, the prospect of dealing a humiliating blow to the empire's enemies is an attractive one, yet one must be careful not to antagonise his own citizens in the process, who knows what the Muslim faithful are prepared to do in retaliation, which is exactly why, we must neuter the rest of the Arab world, before they form a pact against us.  "
 byz_sands_arabia_title: "Sands of Arabia" 
 byz_sands_arabia_desc: "With this, it is done. The eternal enemy of the empire has been defeated, humiliated, their will to fight snuffed out, the flame in their hearts has gone out, it is almost sad to witness a proud and industrious people like the Arabs, reduced to... this, but alas, it has been done out of necessity, to ensure our empire has safe borders and our citizens can live safe lives even in the borderlands. But this is not the only reason for this conquest, this opens paths to much easier ways of trade with the east trough now Roman controlled routes and ports. And who knows, maybe we shall set out and claim more land for the glory of Rome from these very ports! "

The Pandidakterion was refounded in 1046 by Constantine IX Monomachos who created the Departments of Law and Philosophy. At the time various economic schools, colleges, polytechnics, libraries and fine arts academies also operated in the city of Constantinople. Since then it has fallen to disrepair due to the lack of funding and many misfortunes of the Empire.

 byz_neoplatonic_academy_desc: "Since times ancient, Athens has been the seat of bright minds and ideas.

 byz_invest_balkans_desc: "One of the most unstable regions, the Balkans have known nothing but war and endless famine as well as poverty in the past few centuries.

 byz_raise_wooden_wall_desc: "The battles we fought in times of old across the red-stained Mediterranean Sea are the backbones of legends. Despite that, our galleys are not feared anymore.

It first appeared in the mid-to-late 10th century, and by the 13th century had become the most frequent term used for the Byzantine army's standing regiments, persisting until the late 14th century. Now with the looming threat of the Turkish heathens, it is time to raise the greatest allagia our empire has seen in centuries and reclaim our birthright!

Despite that, however, recent advances in the production of cannons as well as the potency of their munition have led to artillery being heralded as the must-have siege engine and one of the most important factors to winning a battle. To that end, we must secure the production of gunpowder by founding our very own central production line."

 byz_office_of_exarchos_desc: "Annointing Exarchs to oversee vast parts of our Empire is a vital matter that demands immediate attention if we are to keep our numerous bureaucrats and subjects in line. Whether we choose to appoint a political Exarch, one with ecclesiastical or military jurisdiction or all of the above, it is nevertheless a much needed step towards centralizing our vast territories."

 byz_proliferation_musket_desc: "How peculiar that a single heap of gunpowder can trigger a chain of events that would change the world forever. Nations will be torn apart, Empires will fall and an entire continent will be set ablaze in the wake of this event. Alliances are triggered in a chain reaction, resulting in a war that sweeps across Europe like a merciless plague. Armies will destroy the land, soldiers bombard cities endlessly and the shells will leave scars on earth for generations to come. We will also see the birth of some of the most devastating inventions mankind has ever conceived, the matchlock rifles. The future of warfare."
 byz_undermine_nobles_title: "Undermine the Nobility"
 byz_undermine_nobles_desc: "The nobles across our realms have always made up the backbone of vital parts of our administration. Be it via the supplement of coin or men, they have often held the capacity to be 'King-makers' and decide the fate of the Empire itself. However, as we stride forward and modernize our internal affairs, the need for a nobility has become hollow and is fading." 
 byz_reform_judicial_code_title: "Reform the Judicial Code"
 byz_reform_judicial_code_desc: "The Corpus Juris Civilis, commonly known as the Body of Civil Law, was masterfully crafted by Emperor Justinian during his reign in the 6th Century AD. While all our legal scholars will hail Emperor Justinian for his forward way of thinking and ingenuity, it has become apparent that time has had an impact on these legal documents. As a result, it is widely believed that the time is nigh for us to reform our legal code and modernize it, in order to encompass all our subjects and cut a lot of unecessary red tape."

 byz_caesaropapism_desc: "The idea of combining the social and political power of secular government with religious power, or of making secular authority superior to the spiritual authority of the Church; especially concerning the connection of the Church with government is nothing new. Many have tried to sever the link between clerical influence and the crown. However, as we strip the Clergy of their special privileges, we will surely prevail and impose our will upon them." 
 byz_concept_absolutism_title: "Concept of Absolutism" 
 byz_concept_absolutism_desc: "In our monarch's pursuit of absolute power we have come across a new concept of governmental ruling. The political doctrine and practice of unlimited centralized authority and absolute sovereignty, as vested especially in our Emperor. The essence of an absolutist system is that the ruling power is not subject to regularized challenge or check by any other agency, be it judicial, legislative, religious, economic, or electoral. By using brute force, subjugation and concentrating royal power at the hands of our Basileus, Rome will truly and finally have but one head." 
 byz_protocapitalism_title: "Protocapitalism" 
 byz_protocapitalism_desc: "The idea of mercantilism has always been an unreachable dream due to the many influences of the royal court in maritime affairs. Be it internal and powerful merchants imposing their will upon the crown or outside meddlers from Venice or Genoa, we seldomly had the final say in regards to the trade policy we are to follow across the markets of our nation. However, that is about to change as we monopolize the sea of Marmara and strip the various Burgher factions of their special privileges."

Their eradication and conversion to the Papist sect will not be forgotten, nor forgiven.

 ppbyz_citadel_saladin_desc: "Cairo, once called Memphis has persisted trough the ages, it was the most important city in ancient Egypt until Alexandria surpassed it with its importance during the Ptolemaic period and when we took control of it. Its current status of importance has only been established after the Muslim conquest of Egypt and the city as it is, stands against everything we stand for. It is a symbol of rule before and after Greeks and Romans held control of Egypt, it is a symbol of our decline and a symbol of the loss of faith in the region. That being said, it is up to us to choose what we do with it, do we integrate this symbol and make it our own, a symbol of reborn faith, or do we strip it of everything of importance and bring it back to Constantinople as a humiliation to the Citadel of Saladin.

It just so happens that the Maghreb is the next goal of our reconquest effort, with it being an important stepping stone for further reconquest in the western Mediterranean, it being across a strait from Hispania, as well as being the home of the famous Berber sailors, which will help us in defeating the Spanish armada and landing in Hispania with ease.

Some have gone as far as to even dispute their monarch's absolute power and attempt his deposition and replacement with a puppet for them to control its strings.

But it wasn't always so, after the conquest of Bulgaria in the 11th century by Basil the Bulgar slayer and a short lived resistance, the Bulgarians were easily integrated into the Roman aristocracy and the empire's administration due to the diplomatic skill of Basil.

After Emperor Manuel's death, Stefan would proclaim himself independent and the Serbian state would remain fiercely so, until now. The Roman mimicking rump state of Serbia shall bend their knee to the Emperor once more.

Whatever we choose, one thing is certain, Roman control over Egypt has been reestablished, from the river Nile to Cyrenaica, the Egyptian people are welcomed back into the fold as Romans and the many Christians in the region are starting to show themselves more openly than before, feeling safe within our Christian empire's borders.

Since then it has fallen to disrepair due to the lack of funding and many misfortunes of the Empire. As a sign of prosperity returning, we must restore this bright institution to the best of our abilities!" 
 ppbyz_neoplatonic_academy_title: "Neoplatonic Academy" 
 ppbyz_neoplatonic_academy_desc: "Since times ancient, Athens has been the seat of bright minds and ideas. Perhaps it would be wise for the crown to re-establish an academy for the mind and maybe even attract bright renaissance individuals as we turn Athens into one of the most important cities of Europe."
 ppbyz_invest_balkans_title: "Invest in the Balkans" 
 ppbyz_invest_balkans_desc: "One of the most unstable regions, the Balkans have known nothing but war and endless famine as well as poverty in the past few centuries. However, as the region now lays firmly within our domain, it is time we look into expanding its infrastructure and developing the many cities across its provinces." 
 ppbyz_raise_wooden_wall_title: "Raise the Wooden Wall" 
 ppbyz_raise_wooden_wall_desc: "The battles we fought in times of old across the red-stained Mediterranean Sea are the backbones of legends. Despite that, our galleys are not feared anymore. Our enemies laugh at the decay that has gripped our ships. Expanding the number of galley warships and our naval forces would be a resounding response to all those who doubt our resilience!"
 ppbyz_admiralty_purple_title: "Admiralty of the Purple" 
 ppbyz_admiralty_purple_desc: "Military expertsise is a very valuable and sought-after commodity. In order to pass down the knowledge from one generation to the next, we will found the Empire's first and modernized admiralty, a school of tactics and maritime affairs in Constantinople." 
 ppbyz_great_allagia_title: "Great Allagia" 
 ppbyz_great_allagia_desc: "The allagion was a Byzantine military term designating a military unit. It first appeared in the mid-to-late 10th century, and by the 13th century had become the most frequent term used for the Byzantine army's standing regiments, persisting until the late 14th century. Now with the looming threat of the Turkish heathens, it is time to raise the greatest allagia our empire has seen in centuries and reclaim our birthright! With the support of our nobles we will gain a loyal general to lead it to victory! " 
 ppbyz_recover_asia_minor_title: "Recover Asia Minor" 
 ppbyz_recover_asia_minor_desc: ""Do you see the great coasts of Mikra Asia? Our brethren await for us there, they await for their emperor to save them from the heathen, they await for the glorious trade centers of the Mediterranean to reawaken, they await... and we shall not abandon them." Said Basileus $MONARCH$ to his son, firmly grasping his sword, filled with determination and grief for the continued suffering of his Roman people.  "  
 ppbyz_push_eastern_front_title: "Push the Eastern Front" 
 ppbyz_push_eastern_front_desc: "The Ottomans are not the only invading force in Anatolia, there are many Beyliks pretending to be regional powers that we must sweep off of our doorstep, including the Sheep brought by the devil himself, Timur, we must deal with them before they become a much greater threat than they currently are, or we will not be able to rid our mountains of Aq Qoyunlu and liberate our Armenian brothers in Christ before it is too late for them. " 
 ppbyz_lost_sheep_title: "The Lost Sheep"
 ppbyz_lost_sheep_desc: "The Caucasus are inhabited by peoples that have been friends to us for a long time, the Armenians, the Georgians, the Circassians, all brothers in faith and all struggled against the Arabs, Turks and finally Timur. During our glory days, these peoples were all protected by us, some directly as they swore fealty to us, some indirectly trough defensive pacts against our common enemies, now it is time to bring these nations back into the fold under our wing and protect them once more as the bastion of the faith that we are. " 
 ppbyz_rivalries_old_title: "Rivalries of Old"
 ppbyz_rivalries_old_desc: "Persia, our once greatest rival, like Icarus, getting too close to the sun, their hubris and ambition is what led to their fall in the end, where we survived, they could not. The once greatest rival, might be our greatest asset now, the Persian lands are rich and profitable, filled with trade opportunities we can take advantage of and the Zagros mountains that would undoubtedly protect our eastern borders while they prosper in safety. We shall take advantage of the weakness and fractures in the region, and become the unifying force of Persia, a Roman Persia. " 
 ppbyz_compromise_synaxis_title: "Compromise & Synaxis" 
 ppbyz_compromise_synaxis_desc: "Desperate times call for desperate measures. As the Turks, amongst our many enemies, surround us on all sides, it has become apparent that we need to reach out and establish alliances with monarchs whose interests align with ours. However, many diplomats in our court are of the belief that the head of the See of Rome would be of valuable help, should he be persuaded to send assistance against the Turks." 
 ppbyz_imperial_maritime_fleets_title: "Imperial Trade Fleets" 
 ppbyz_imperial_maritime_fleets_desc: "At the height of our power, our naval forces employed many vagabond sailors and tough men of the waves. As we restore the strength of the throne and our territorial integrity, it is simply vital to reassess our naval prowess and even ressurect the Carabisians, the main forces of the once-formidable Byzantine navy." 
 ppbyz_glass_silk_gems_title: "Glass Silk & Gems" 
 ppbyz_glass_silk_gems_desc: "One of the economic foundations of the empire was trade. Constantinople was located on important east-west and north-south trade routes. Silk was used by the state both as a means of payment, and of diplomacy. Raw silk was bought from China and made up into fine brocades and cloth-of-gold that commanded high prices through the world. Ceramics, linen, and woven cloth were also items of trade. Luxury items, such as silks, perfumes, valuable glass, gems and spices were also important." 
 ppbyz_city_world_title: "City of the World" 
 ppbyz_city_world_desc: "No other city across the old continent can possess as much splendorous grandeur as our capital, Constantinople. It is our patriotic duty to elevate the city to the heights of its glory and let it shine forever more as the pride jewel of a resurging new and modernized Empire!" 
 ppbyz_anatolian_heartland_title: "Anatolian Heartland"
 ppbyz_anatolian_heartland_desc: "Our territorial conquests in Anatolia have yielded tremendous prestige and glorious results in the never-ending struggle to expand our Empire and restore our old borders. However, conquest is only half the success. If we are to leave a lasting mark in history and hold onto our clay, we must invest time, coin and sweat into it." 
 ppbyz_kasbah_tunis_title: "Kasbah of Tunis" 
 ppbyz_kasbah_tunis_desc: "From the Punic wars to the Vandalic wars, the lands of Tunis have been soaked with Roman blood too many times for it not to be a part of our empire, although the likes of Belisarius might never be born again, the empire itself has been reborn stronger than before, that fact alone will be enough to wipe any Tunisian resistance in the area and reclaim the oh so important center of trade in the Mediterranean for Rome. As for the city itself, it shall be reconstructed and embellished to resemble the old Carthage, as well as reinforced to serve as a bastion in case of insurrection or foreign invasion attempts, as if anyone would be foolish enough... " 
 ppbyz_nile_breadbasket_title: "Develop the Nile" 
 ppbyz_nile_breadbasket_desc: "The banks of the Nile bring life to immesurable amounts of provinces and land across the deserts of Egypt. It would be a profitable and necessary investment to fund the construction and development of the areas around the river for the continuous prosperity of our Egyptian subjects."  
 ppbyz_reclaim_naval_supremacy_title: "Reclaim Naval Supremacy" 
 ppbyz_reclaim_naval_supremacy_desc: "For far too long we have let our fate lay at the hands of Italians and other parasites that infest the Aegean. The time has come for the Empire to declare naval superiority against all those who wish to claim our wealth and steal our affluence." 
 ppbyz_advent_gunpowder_title: "Advent of Gunpowder" 
 ppbyz_advent_gunpowder_desc: "The use of gunpowder has been a feature of warfare for quite some time. Despite that, however, recent advances in the production of cannons as well as the potency of their munition have led to artillery being heralded as the must-have siege engine and one of the most important factors to winning a battle. To that end, we must secure the production of gunpowder by founding our very own central production line."
 ppbyz_appease_the_domestikoi_title: "Apppease the Domestikoi"
 ppbyz_appease_the_domestikoi_desc: "Bureaucracy is a delicate dance of diplomacy and strength. As such, we must make amends and tend to the needs of the royal high offices across our land"
 ppbyz_enlightened_education_title: "Enlightened Education" 
 ppbyz_enlightened_education_desc: "A nation is as collected and robust as its individual citizens. To cultivate a national identity and push radical reforms that will improve the quality of life for our citizens as well as help us administrate the far corners of our Empire, we must not neglect the funding of local universities and Sunday schools across our great nation." 
 ppbyz_office_of_exarchos_title: "Office of Exarchos"
 ppbyz_office_of_exarchos_desc: "Annointing Exarchs to oversee vast parts of our Empire is a vital matter that demands immediate attention if we are to keep our numerous bureaucrats and subjects in line. Whether we choose to appoint a political Exarch, one with ecclesiastical or military jurisdiction or all of the above, it is nevertheless a much needed step towards centralizing our vast territories." 
 ppbyz_proliferation_musket_title: "Proliferation of the Musket"
 ppbyz_proliferation_musket_desc: "How peculiar that a single heap of gunpowder can trigger a chain of events that would change the world forever. Nations will be torn apart, Empires will fall and an entire continent will be set ablaze in the wake of this event. Alliances are triggered in a chain reaction, resulting in a war that sweeps across Europe like a merciless plague. Armies will destroy the land, soldiers bombard cities endlessly and the shells will leave scars on earth for generations to come. We will also see the birth of some of the most devastating inventions mankind has ever conceived, the matchlock rifles. The future of warfare."
 ppbyz_undermine_nobles_title: "Undermine the Nobility"
 ppbyz_undermine_nobles_desc: "The nobles across our realms have always made up the backbone of vital parts of our administration. Be it via the supplement of coin or men, they have often held the capacity to be 'King-makers' and decide the fate of the Empire itself. However, as we stride forward and modernize our internal affairs, the need for a nobility has become hollow and is fading." 
 ppbyz_reform_judicial_code_title: "Reform the Judicial Code"
 ppbyz_reform_judicial_code_desc: "The Corpus Juris Civilis, commonly known as the Body of Civil Law, was masterfully crafted by Emperor Justinian during his reign in the 6th Century AD. While all our legal scholars will hail Emperor Justinian for his forward way of thinking and ingenuity, it has become apparent that time has had an impact on these legal documents. As a result, it is widely believed that the time is nigh for us to reform our legal code and modernize it, in order to encompass all our subjects and cut a lot of unecessary red tape." 
 ppbyz_seven_towers_title: "Construct the Seven Towers"
 ppbyz_seven_towers_desc: "The famed complex of the Seven Towers is an ambitious project brought forth by the Empire's top engineers.

 ppbyz_army_of_the_basileus_title: "Army of the Basileus" 
 ppbyz_army_of_the_basileus_desc: "Discipline, inspiration, loyalty and duty shall be the 4 cornerstones of our glorious armed forces. If we are to defend ourselves from our many rivals and be successful at vanquishing them in the process of extending our coat of arms from continent to continent, we must make sure our army is an elite force to be reckoned with!" 
 ppbyz_caesaropapism_title: "Caesaropapism" 
 ppbyz_caesaropapism_desc: "The idea of combining the social and political power of secular government with religious power, or of making secular authority superior to the spiritual authority of the Church; especially concerning the connection of the Church with government is nothing new. Many have tried to sever the link between clerical influence and the crown. However, as we strip the Clergy of their special privileges, we will surely prevail and impose our will upon them." 
 ppbyz_concept_absolutism_title: "Concept of Absolutism" 
 ppbyz_concept_absolutism_desc: "In our monarch's pursuit of absolute power we have come across a new concept of governmental ruling. The political doctrine and practice of unlimited centralized authority and absolute sovereignty, as vested especially in our Emperor. The essence of an absolutist system is that the ruling power is not subject to regularized challenge or check by any other agency, be it judicial, legislative, religious, economic, or electoral. By using brute force, subjugation and concentrating royal power at the hands of our Basileus, Rome will truly and finally have but one head." 
 ppbyz_protocapitalism_title: "Protocapitalism" 
 ppbyz_protocapitalism_desc: "The idea of mercantilism has always been an unreachable dream due to the many influences of the royal court in maritime affairs. Be it internal and powerful merchants imposing their will upon the crown or outside meddlers from Venice or Genoa, we seldomly had the final say in regards to the trade policy we are to follow across the markets of our nation. However, that is about to change as we monopolize the sea of Marmara and strip the various Burgher factions of their special privileges." 
 ppbyz_raise_the_defenses_title: "Protect the Coasts" 
 ppbyz_raise_the_defenses_desc: "The need for a standing marine force is apparent as we enter the early modern era of naval combat. To protect our coasts we shall erect massive coastal defences and increase our sailor pool as well as fund the potential construction of our very first pride of the fleet. Our enemies shall tremble at the sight of our cannons, be it in coasts or afloat!" 
 ppbyz_fund_urban_infrastructure_title: "Fund Ethnikes Ipodomes"
 ppbyz_fund_urban_infrastructure_desc: "The need for a modernized road infrastructure and a series of intricate canal systems has become apparent as we fund various projects to modernize and restructure our Empire and societies at large. In order to maximize profiteering from trade and open up new habitable parts of our urban environments, many aspiring civil egineers have approached our court with the suggestion of a grand project dubbed 'Ethnikes Ipodomes' (National Infrastructures project)." 
 ppbyz_enforce_nomisma_title: "Enforce the Nomisma" 
 ppbyz_enforce_nomisma_desc: "An Empire with our prestige and size often faces multiple problems such as mismanagement and corruption. By imposing our trading practices in vital trade ports abroad and regulating our economy, we shall introduce a new currency that will surely shape the entire world, its influence and power transcending our borders." 
 ppbyz_promote_byzantine_goods_title: "Lead Industrial Efforts" 
 ppbyz_promote_byzantine_goods_desc: "The introduction of modernized ways to extract minerals and materials from the ground has led to accessing never-before-reached underbellies of the Earth that are filled with precious metals and materials. In order to maximize our profit and attain our rightful spot at the spearhead of the industrial evolution we must bolster and develop our greatest centers of excavation and production!" 
 ppbyz_restore_pentarchy_title: "Restore the Pentarchy" 
 ppbyz_restore_pentarchy_desc: "While we held the Patriarchate of Constantinople for a long time from a state of decay, never was our hope to restore the Pentarchy. As our empire grows, we must restore the Pentarchy and lead all of our brothers and sisters in Christ!"

 FU_Byzantium_Events.1.t: "Mending the Schism"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.1.d: "For centuries there existed a rift between the two biggest churches of Christianity. Differences based on the way of worshipping and what constitutes a deity were among the many factors that contributed to the fragmentation of our faith. However, the recent conquest of the celebrated capital of Catholicism has proven once and for all which is the dominant faith. Let those who dispute our divine claim tremble in the face of our resolve!" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.1.a: "A victorious day for Orthodoxy!"
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.2.t: "Downfall of Catholicism" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.2.d: "For centuries there existed a rift between the two biggest churches of Christianity. Differences based on the way of worshipping and what constitutes a deity were among the many factors that contributed to the fragmentation of our faith. However, the recent conquest of the celebrated capital of Catholicism has proven once and for all that we have faltered in the face of a vastly superior enemy. Rome now rests in the hands of the Byzantine Emperor and calls for the conversion of all Catholics spread across Europe." 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.2.a: "A bitter pill to swallow..." 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.2.b: "Bend the knee to a bunch of pretenders? Never!"
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.20.t: "The Riches of Cairo"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.20.d: "A city resting in the most fertile part of the Nile, Cairo has experienced tremendous prosperity in the past few decades, even centuries. So much so, that all manner of treasures, jewels, valuables and metals have been stored in its treasuries since the old times. As the city falls, its riches lay firmly within our grasp and the question of how we shall handle them is a burning question among our advisors. Some have vocally suggested the relocation of the city's wealth to Constantinople, our capital, whereas others suggest the notion that it's our duty to respect the city and leave it as intact as possible..." 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.20.a: "These artifacts will adorn [Root.Capital.GetName]" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.20.b: "We must respect the history and heritage of these people. Take only reparations in coin"
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.3.t: "The Offer of the Phoenix" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.3.d: "Word has arrived from Iberia that our accursed overlords have lost an all-out war against the superior armies of the Byzantine Empire. The Purple Emperor has sent envoys bearing an interesting proposal. Indeed he suggests we would fair better under Byzantine rule. Despite this, we may consider grasping this opportunity to push forward and claim our freedom against our weakened overlord." 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.3.a: "Let us align ourselves under the Byzantine banner." 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.3.b: "This is our chance at independence."
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.4.t: "Imperial Themata of Byzantium"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.4.d: "The Theme System once adorned our borders, keeping our people safe. Now, as our Empire makes a firm step towards recovery, it is only logical to re-establish this old institution and help safeguard our land from hostile neighbours.\n\n Originally established as a way to safeguard the many far corners of the Empire, the Theme System granted land to soldiers, farmsteads and fields to cultivate and protect, in exchange with their military service. Furthermore, it delegated more authority to local nobles and administrators, who often took matters in their own hands. No matter the system's flaws, however, reviving it is a good first step towards securing our domain as well as a legitimate exhibition of strength!" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.4.a: "They shall receive full funding!" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.4.b: "Allocate some funds from the central treasury."
 FU_Byzantium_Events.4.c: "Use local donations instead."
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.5.t: "The End of Bulgarian Independence?"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.5.d: "The Bulgars have always been a major thorn in our side. Decades of warfare, pillaging and destruction brought about by the senseless bloodshed between our people. In fact, the constant battles with them played a major part in the Dark Age we experienced, between the 13th and early 15th century as they clashed with our armed forces or uprising against our rule, resulting in us losing influence in our Asia Minor territories. To that end, we are called to decide on the fate of these people and see to it that they never again rise up to dispute our divine rule. Should we decide to erase their memory off the history books, in the case we do not reign supreme as their overlord, or choose to pursue a  reconciliatory policy towards the people of Bulgaria ?" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.5.a: "A foe that will torment us no more!"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.5.b: "Co-existence is key!"
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.6.t: "Reconquest of Jerusalem"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.6.d: "Ring the Church bells merrily! Jerusalem, the city of God, is ours! A day of celebration for all Christians, even accursed Infidels, as the White City joins the banner of the glorious Byzantine Empire. Jerusalem has been a contested jewel between us, Catholicism and the world of Islam, the powerful and prestigious Sultan of Osman and the Mamluks. This is truly a sign of divine favour, such prestigious and prosperous people as ours are blessed with the privilege to serve as the guardians of the symbol of Christianity!"

 FU_Byzantium_Events.8.t: "The Status of the Serbian Lands"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.8.d: "The Serbian Despot has, for far too long, eyed our territories in the Balkans and even went as far as to demand the crown of our Empire at the height of his power. Look at them now! Such meagre scum deserve no pity or salvation. Despite that, perhaps they could repay a fraction of the damage they've caused as a loyal pawn, a vassal of the mighty Byzantine Emperor? Whatever the royal council decides, it has become both certain and apparent that the dreams of Serbian independence have finally been laid to rest for good. The Phoenix reigns supreme!" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.8.a: "Restore the local Despot!"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.8.b: "These lands belong to the Roman Emperor!"
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.9.t: "Conquest of Egypt" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.9.d: "Ah, Egypt. The land of Pharaohs, magnificent pyramids and knowledge long lost across its valleys and riverbanks. For decades we have struggled to bring the entire region under our banner and under God's divine guidance we are finally victorious. The Nile provides abundant water and irrigation for crops to grow and thus its banks overflow with life and quality goods, paper, grain, people and animals prosper harmoniously across the entire region. Despite conquering it however, it has become clear to our board of advisors that properly administrating this vast land is nigh-impossible. One radical proposal is to re-establish the Mamlukean regime under our administration, provided the former is wiped out or has been sufficiently subjugated in order to establish a vassalage relationship instead of attempting direct ownership of these territories." 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.9.a: "It will be a subdivision of our Empire!"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.9.b: "It's an indivisible part of our patrimony!"
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.10.t: "The Kingdom of Prester John" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.10.d: "Prester John was a legendary Christian patriarch, presbyter, and king. Stories popular in Europe in the twelfth through to the seventeenth centuries told of a Nestorian patriarch and king who was said to rule over a Christian nation lost amid the pagans and Muslims in the Orient. Despite many people believing in the legend, however, we have established a firm presence in the Horn of Africa and now have a stable relationship with many Copts of the region. Handling this peculiar and interesting branch of Christianity is a matter of importance and it befalls us to decide how to handle our stance towards them, be it conciliatory or aggressive... "

 FU_Byzantium_Events.11.d: "What is a nation if not the culmination of its struggles? What is a nation if not an intricate network of cultures, peoples and ideas? Our troops in every front conquer and vanquish our enemies. Victory after victory our armed forces have shattered our enemies, forced them into unruly retreats and pillaged their cities. Back home, we have improved on our administration's efficiency and honed the military expertise of our general staff and troops. All these innovations, political and military victories across the board have finally cultivated in the moment our entire populace and yourself have been waiting for. We stand at the crossroads of history, an opportunity for our glorious nation to revive its Roman identity. We can choose to shoot for the stars and propel our name as the saviors of Rome, restoring the bastion of Christianity to its former glory. It is up to you, to decide what type of Rome may be born out of our labors. Alternatively, we can also opt to remain true to our roots should we deem it premature to celebrate the return of the Roman Empire."

 FU_Byzantium_Events.12.d: "Since the times of old, Islamic Scholars from the four corners of the Muslim world have gathered in Baghdad to exchange and brew new and innovative ideas for the progression of our species. Ideas such as literature, mathematics, algebra and alchemic science is but a fraction of the knowledge held within this old and wise city. Now, as our troops secure the citadel and the surrounding areas of its urban sprawl, we find ourselves amidst rich texts of science, hidden within the libraries of the House of Wisdom. Knowledge used and perfected by many people of thought that came before us, knowledge that now lays securely within our grasp."
 FU_Byzantium_Events.12.a: "Knowledge to enlighten our people!"

 FU_Byzantium_Events.13.d: "It is true that the world around us changes. Scientific and social revolutions are but one of the levers used by the divine to keep humanity on the constant road towards greatness and the future. Recent victories in the field have granted our nation tremendous wealth and affluence across the four corners of our Empire. Because of this, our people have prospered and dedicate their time into arts, science and innovation. So much so that a great number of our enlightened advisors have suggested a slew radical reforms and governmental additions that, despite coming at the great cost of giving up much of the Emperor's Authority, may benefit our nation and prevent decay or stagnation from taking roots."

Oftentimes affectionately called 'Symvasilevousa' (meaning, co-reigning city) she flourished under our regime at the height of our power. Now, as she returns to us once more, it is our duty to elevate the city to its former glory and establish it as a seal of our imminent return to power in the Balkans and beyond!"

 FU_Byzantium_Events.15.x: "A merciless foe, the Osman Sultanate, now lays in ruins. In its stead, the Phoenix shall rise and envelop all the territories we lost to these rabid dogs. As we clean up our Anatolian lands of these foes, it has become apparent that much of the Osman dynasty's bureaucracy and administration is left headless, wandering aimlessly, in need of a firm guiding hand. It is up to us to decide if we wish to cultivate upon their institutions or bask in the glory of their destruction by the glorious Byzantine Empire."

 FU_Byzantium_Events.16.d: "The western parts of Anatolia were part of our Empire not so long ago. With the recent reconquest of these lands come sizable Turkish populations that had previously established roots in these areas. Animosity and hatred runs deep between our people and the Turks and many voices across our courtyard and even on the streets demand the complete and utter eradication of the foreign populations. Uprooting entire societies may leave more room for us to install and bring back the Greek presence in Anatolia but perhaps there is another way, of exploiting the poplation in exchange for guaranteeing their survival? Whatever the case may be and whatever course of action we choose to follow, this decision will ripple across the chambers of history for centuries to come!"

 FU_Byzantium_Events.17.d: "A de facto part of our Empire at the height of its power, the Kingdom of Georgia stood alone for centuries against Islamic foes on all directions.

 FU_Byzantium_Events.18.d: "The final hour of the last remnant of our once-glorious Empire draws near. It is time to send a message to our accursed religious rivals in Rome and attempt to reconcile our differences in the face of total destruction and a common foe. By using experienced rhetoric and well-placed compliments towards the Pope, we can make one final attempt to ask the West for help against the hordes of the Osman dynasty.

 FU_Byzantium_Events.19.d: "The center of our lively Empire, nay the center of the world is none other than the bountiful and beautiful Queen of the Cities, Constantinople. No other metropolis has such population, such elegance, beauty and culture. As such the city attracts many experienced and able craftsmen who manufacture and sell their goods at the markets in the heart of Constantinople. Thus, it is up to us to choose what type of craftsmen and goods we will bolster and make a name for ourselves under.

 FU_Byzantium_Events.24.d: "A messenger from Byzantium has brought forth a final plea for help, asking from our Holy Father an olive branch and help against the oncoming Turkish horde. Despite their tonedeaf approach, it would be wise to consider their letter as they, despite whatever decay they have experienced, are still the true Rome, ever so meager and weak."

 FU_Byzantium_Events.25.t: "The Papal Delegate Arrives" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.25.d: "A messenger from the Papacy has brought forth the demands made by the Pope himself. He demands no less than the conversion of all territories of the Empire along with the immediate baptism of the current royal family, and eternal allegience to the Holy See. Such demands are surely harsh and will cause trouble across our remaining provinces, but, perhaps it is the only way according to many of our diplomats and members of the royal family."

 FU_Byzantium_Events.26.d: "A great war ravages the lands of Europe. The armies of Byzantium have challenged the crown of the Holy Roman Empire itself for the title of Rome. However, this is not a mere war, as it stands the Byzantines have aligned themselves with the Protestant virus that plagues our courts across Europe and beyond. Should we stand down and enjoy the burning of the Empire or rush to its defense?"

 FU_Byzantium_Events.30.t: "The Sacking of Venezia" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.30.d: "They say revenge is a dish best served cold. However, we beg to disagree since the fires around the capital of our accursed enemies, the Venetians, tend to burn quite warm. Some say this is divine retribution, for the crimes these accursed infidels perpetrated against our beloved capital, Constantinople. We have not forgotten how the Crusaders plundered and set the streets of our once-affluent city, ablaze. Slaughtering indiscriminately and seeking only gold and compensation for their 'noble' service. No, there will be no mercy tonight on the people of Venezia. Tonight, they will taste the terror they once inflicted upon us.\n\nAlthough, as many men of tactical finesse have pointed out, the city might soon come under our banner, it would be a good gesture and a sound plan to spare it as much as possible..."

 FU_Byzantium_Events.31.d: "A busy sea makes for profitable merchants. Such is the case for the sea that gently engulfs our Greek domain in the Balkans and Asia Minor. As one would expect, the Hellespont, the port of Constantinople and the Aegean Sea are bustling with the lifeblood of civilization: coin! Many merchants from across the most exotic and faraway corners of the world come to our shores and markets to trade off their valuables for the currency of the Emperor. As such, many Venetian merchants have chosen to parley and haggle over the prices of our cloth and glass and make business that could potentially profit both parties. Nevertheless, allowing Venetian merchants into our markets, however rich they may be, may inadvertently fund our future enemies."

 FU_Byzantium_Events.32.d: "Well, my brothers, if we must fight for one of our divine obligations, we will be even more liable under the command strength of all four virtues of our nation; as you can clearly understand. If God grants victory to the impious because of my own sins, we will endanger our lives for our holy faith, which Christ gave us with his own blood. This is most important of all. Even if one gains the entire world but loses his soul in the process, what will be the benefit! Second, we will be deprived of such famous homeland and of our liberty. Third, our empire, renowned in the past but presently humbled, low and exhausted, will be ruled by a tyrant and an impious man. Fourth, we will be separated from our dearest children, wives and relatives. \nNow the mad Sultan wants to enslave our jewel and throw the yoke upon the Mistress of Cities, our holy churches, where the Holy Trinity was worshiped, where the Holy Spirit was glorified in hymns, where angels were heard praising in chant the deity of and the incarnation of God’s word, he wants to turn into shrines of his blasphemy, shrines of the mad and false Prophet, Mohammed, as well as into stables for his horses and camels."

Horror, oh the calamity of the troubled soul! Gripping our seats in mortal terror as the scenes play out. Such vibrancy of wondrous emotion as the actors play their part so realistically they grip the audience with their every gesture. Tragedy! Ah, to weep with every sweep of the stage and mourn the loss of a well-played character. \n\nThese expressions of art have been resurrected as we have regained our influence and spare coin to fund literary works and old epics across our Empire."

Over the ages many have tried taking what is not theirs, yet the crown of the one true Rome rests safely with us. Despite such reassurances from our advisors and envoys abroad, the Holy Roman Emperor dares retain his empty title and challenge our authority as one true Rome.

As Despot of the Morea since 1428, he distinguished himself in campaigns that annexed the Principality of Achaea and brought the Duchy of Athens under temporary Byzantine suzerainty, but was unable to repel Turkish attacks under Turahan Bey. As the eldest surviving brother, he is to succeed John VIII after the latter's death. However, he is not the only prince of the Palaiologoi dynasty. Alongside him, his brothers Thomas and Dimitrios have lawfully served the throne. Dimitrios, in particular has developed tremendous aspirations for the Byzantine throne, or what's left of it. To add further insult to injury, Dimitrios marches to Constantinople under the blessings of the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmet II and his advisors. He has promised the Turks abundant coin from the royal treasury and the titles of the Empire in exchange for the throne. Whoever we choose to support in this struggle, we best think of our choice thoroughly as it could shape the fate of the entire land."

Historically, Gelati was a cultural and intellectual centre in Georgia. It had an Academy that employed Georgian scientists, theologians and philosophers, many of whom had previously been active at various Orthodox monasteries abroad, such as the Mangana Monastery in Constantinople. Among its notable scholars were Ioane Petritsi, who translated several classics of philosophy but is best known for his commentaries on Proclus; and Arsen Ikaltoeli, known for his Dogmatikon, or book of teachings, influenced by Aristotle. The Gelati Academy employed scribes to compile manuscript copies of important works and people of the time called it "a new Hellas" and "a second Athos".

 FU_Byzantium_Events.40.t: "Silk & Tyrian Purple"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.40.d: "The Byzantine capital of Constantinople was the first significant silk-weaving center in Europe. Silk was one of the most important commodities in the Byzantine economy, used by the state both as a means of payment and of diplomacy. \nRaw silk was bought to our court from China and made up into fine fabrics that commanded high prices throughout the European world. Later, silkworms were smuggled into the Empire and the overland silk trade gradually became less important. After the reign of Justinian I, the manufacture and sale of silk became an imperial monopoly, only processed in imperial factories, and sold to authorized buyers. \nByzantine silks are significant for their brilliant colours, use of gold thread, and intricate designs that approach the pictorial complexity of embroidery in loom-woven fabric. Byzantium dominated silk production in Europe throughout the Early Middle Ages, until the establishment of the Italian silk-weaving industry in the 12th century and the conquest and break-up of the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade in 1204. \nDespite numerous setbacks, production has been revived with manufactories of silk across our great nation producing the finest of the finest in terms of both quality and quantity. By using a special dye called 'Tyrian Purple' made out of snails, the fabric is given its characteristic royal purple shade that adorns our most illustrious monarchs."

 FU_Byzantium_Events.49.t: "Giovanni Justiniani" 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.49.d: "Giovanni Justiniani is a Genoese captain, a member of one of the greatest families of the Republic of Genoa, a kinsman to the powerful house of Doria in Genoa, and protostrator of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. He led 700 professional soldiers, both Genoese and Greeks from the island of Chios, which at the time was part of the Republic of Genoa, to the defense of Constantinople against the Ottoman army of Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. He personally financed, organized and led this expedition on his own initiative, and upon arriving was placed in command of the land defenses by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire. Giustiniani was key in controlling the land forces and keeping the Greeks, Genoese and Venetians from quarrelling with each other, and instead kept focused on repairing the land walls after the Ottoman cannons had shot holes in them. It was at least partly because of Giustiniani's charisma that the Byzantine forces were able to hold out so long against overwhelming odds.\n\nOn 29 May 1453, during the final attack by Mehmed II, Giustiniani was wounded by an Ottoman cannon while defending the walls of Constantinople. Some sources say the wound was caused by a crossbow bolt. Sources disagree about whether the wound was to his arm, leg, or chest, but it forced him to withdraw from his station at the land wall. He exited through the locked gate into the city, which opened up the opportunity for the fearful to flee, and panic spread throughout the lines. \n\nSeeing the loss of morale caused among the defenders by Giustiniani's retreat, Mehmed II ordered a renewed assault that eventually overwhelmed the Byzantine defenses and Constantinople was taken by the Turks. Although Giustiniani's men managed to escape with their general after its fall, Giustiniani would go on to die from his wounds on 1 June 1453."
 FU_Byzantium_Events.49.a: "A noble man to spearhead the defensive efforts of Constantinople!"
 
 FU_Byzantium_Events.50.t: "Gemistus Plethon"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.50.d: "Heralded as one of the most renowned philosophers of the late Byzantine era, Gemistus was a chief pioneer of the revival of Greek scholarship in Western Europe. As revealed in his last literary work, the Nomoi or Book of Laws, which he only circulated among close friends, he rejected Christianity in favour of a return to the worship of the classical Hellenic Gods, mixed with ancient wisdom based on Zoroaster and the Magi. He re-introduced Plato's ideas to Western Europe during the 1438–1439 Council of Florence, a failed attempt to reconcile the East–West schism. There, Plethon met and influenced Cosimo de' Medici to found a new Platonic Academy, which, under Marsilio Ficino, would proceed to translate into Latin all of Plato's works, the Enneads of Plotinus, and various other Neoplatonist works. "
 FU_Byzantium_Events.50.a: "He is harmless and innovative, let him advance our court!"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.50.b: "This paganistic nonsense belongs to the past."

 FU_Byzantium_Events.51.t: "$PROVINCENAME$ Changes Culture"
 FU_Byzantium_Events.51.d: "Our empire consists of a myriad of different cultures, some large some small. Naturally all pale in comparison to the beauty and sophistication of Hellenism. The majority of our subjects in one of our many provinces have embraced our cultural superiority and joined our Hellenic family. They have begun following the same type of traditions, clothing and other elements inherent to culture. We should rejoice, for it is not only beautiful day for our people and new brothers and sisters that have joined us. But it will also make ruling this province far easier now they align closely to us, it appears our cultural domination hasn't stopped since Geometric period."
 FU_Byzantium_Events.51.a: "Great!"
