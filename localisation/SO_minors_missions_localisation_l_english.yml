 SO.EVTNAME30:0 "The Confederation of the Elbe"
 SO.EVTDESC30:0 "The Elba, Rhine, and Danube are the arteries through which trade from the North flows. Each and every one of these river basins holds immense sway in the German economy. Now, having united these once disparate Hansa states under our own banner, we can claim to form a Confederacy surrounding our river. If we do, any states who serve in our trade network will surely bend knee to us."

 shl_1_desc:0 "Our beautiful country has been peaceful too long! The time for expansion has come and we shall start with the peasants in the south!"
 shl_2_desc:0 "We may be politically independent or not: regardless, we must take the reins of our own economic welfare if we are to continue as an independent force in Lübeck."
 shl_3_desc:0 "Although we have won our recent war for independence, there is still more we must do to rise into our own state. Many seek to bring us down and they aim to do so through the peasants republic of Dithmarschen, so we should strike the first blow."
 shl_4_desc:0 "The Hanseatic League has bordered us on all sides, forcing out competing trade like our own. If we are to continue our rise to power, we must wrestle control of our economic standing away from the Hansa."
 shl_5_desc:0 "Our push into Dithmarschen has allowed us a great expansion opportunity in the city-states on the North Sea coast. They are, individually, easy pickings for any nation; we must serve to devour them."
 shl_6_desc:0 "Our increases in power and influence have all allowed us to begin our campaign for Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire! We should begin by swaying electors to our cause."
 shl_7_desc:0 "The great states of Prussia have long held military domination of Germany. We should look to them for our military guidance to build a great power of our own."
 shl_8_desc:0 "The HRE may call itself Roman, but it is clearly German in geography and culture. Proclaiming it as such will lead to some initial shakeups, sure, but long term stability will certainly follow."
 shl_9_desc:0 "Although we were not as strong as we could be, we still have ballooned in size to dominate the geopolitical landscape of Germany. Now, we must dominate the map as well!"
 shl_10_desc:0 "While under the von Habsburgs the Holy German Empire never had a large unitary fleet that could challenge the more navally inclined powers of Spain, Great Britain, or France. We should build a great navy to assert our power."

 SO.EVTNAME31:0 "The Icelandic Destiny"
 SO.EVTDESC31:0 "Over the past centuries our now magnificent nation has rose from merely a geographic term for a speck of land on the corner of the map to one of Europe's premier powers. The road has not been easy, but through it all our government and our people has remained strong, confronting every new obstacle with tenacity and vigor greater than the one before.\n\nNow we face a new question. Through all of our successes we have always been Iceland, of Icelandic people with Icelandic ambitions. However, it seems we have gotten to the end of the road for this story. We of course have the option to remain as Iceland but it may serve us better to claim one of the legacies of our newly conquered lands in Scandinavia."
 SO.31OPTION3:0 "We shall claim to represent all Scandinavians."

 ice_1_desc:0 "We have always been, directly or indirectly, ruled by our liege in Oslo. We must break from our bondage! We have nothing to lose but our chains!"
 ice_2_desc:0 "Inhabiting such a desolate land in the far north out of anyone's way, we have never held a great need for a defensive army. Now, however, we have the freedoms and potential to conduct offensive operations - this requires a military."
 ice_3_desc:0 "The islands that we share the North Sea with have been dominated by the powers that be for centuries. We should liberate them and assilimate them into our country."
 ice_4_desc:0 "Our position in the far north has been particuarly beneficial for lawbreakers, privateers, and pirates. Using the privateer operations based here to our advantage will certainly yield great riches."
 ice_5_desc:0 "After the consolidation of the surrounding islands in the North Sea, we have managed to partially encircle the Fair Isles of England and Scotland. It would serve us well to sieze this land."
 ice_6_desc:0 "Icelandic privateers have found recent successes as state-sponsored privateers in our locality, but with our new expanded navy we have the capacity to plunder far beyond our borders. This is a worthy goal that will lead to great wishes."
 ice_7_desc:0 "Having a solid foothold in the British Isles we may now march to our brothers and sisters in Scandinavia. Taking these lands for ourselves will lead to a great increase in the power and prestige of our nation - along with great economic incentives."
 ice_8_desc:0 "The raids that characterized the long-ended First Viking Age have come once more, this time by our hand. We can easily claim to be the descendants of these Viking empires, as we conduct raids now as well."
 ice_9_desc:0 "Having bested the Scandinavians that once held dominion over us, we may once more march into the annals of history. We shall choose a legacy to uphold."

 seat_of_the_baltic_desc:0 "Gotland has long been a center of trade in the Baltic, but now with our renovations to our new capital city it has begun to carry even more importance as the capital of most Baltic trade. This will surely lead to great wealth and prosperity for our nation."
 SO.EVTNAME32:0 "The Diocese of Visby"
 SO.EVTDESC32:0 "The Diocese of Visby was established in 1572 as the Gotland arm of the Church of Sweden. Now, however, with our independence asserted from all of the powers that be, the matter of establishing the Diocese of Visby has fallen into our hands now. We may choose to simply consolidate the existing churches on the island into a Diocese for the faithful of Gotland proper or we could renovate these cathedrals to establish a truly supreme church on the island.\n\nIf we choose to upohold our existing church we may see a increase in our religious influence at home and abroad, with a renovated cathedral bringing with it its own benefits for the immediate inhabitants of the island."
 SO.32OPTION1:0 "Renovate this cathedral as a great center of Protestant worship."
 SO.32OPTION2:0 "We shall renovate the cathedral as a Catholic center of worship."

 the_diocese_of_visby_desc:0 "The Diocese of Visby was formally established in the mid to late 1500s as the Church of Sweden's arm on the Island of Gotland. It communicated with the Archdiocese of Uppsala outside of Stockholm on matters of state religion and adherence to it. Now, with this new diocese, we may see the growth and prosperity of the island."

 got_1_desc:0 "The island of Gotland has been ruled by outside powers for nearly its entire history. We should reverse this immediately if we ever want to become relevant in European affairs."
 got_2_desc:0 "The pirate kings of Gotland used their superior naval power and geographic position to launch piracy operations in the Baltic. This was immensely profitable for them, therefore we shall continue this tradition."
 got_3_desc:0 "Our home island may be home to a great people and a proud tradition, but its current state is not reflective of that. We should aim to build up our capital city for the greater good of our people."
 got_4_desc:0 "With our home fortified and secure, we may move on to other goals. A rational first step would be pushing into Sweden, as they hold the remainder of Götaland."
 got_5_desc:0 "The Diocese of Visby, formally estavblished in the late 1500s, was a powerful force in controlling the faith of the Gotland population. We should aim to establish this as well for our own religious cohesion."
 got_6_desc:0 "With a foothold secured in southern Sweden, we should naturally push to the waters of the Sound Toll by taking the wealthy areas of the Skaneland. This will lead to a greater position in European and more importantly Scandinavian politics."
 got_7_desc:0 "Being viewed as a conqueror is no good; we must prove our merit to the newly conquered peoples of Götaland through aiding their stability and prosperity efforts."
 got_8_desc:0 "While the Danes may have forgot Erik Gryf of Gotland, oh many years ago, we remember. His claim to the Danish throne provides us with a casus belli to take their throne now!"
 got_9_desc:0 "We have proven our merit to our own people and our conquered populations. This is truly a great legacy to claim, and it will yield to an array of claims to our surrounding nations and regions."
