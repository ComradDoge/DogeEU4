 ME_caliphate_reform_sunni_andalusia_desc: "The Andalusian Caliphate is a Muslim political-religious state, based mainly in the Western Maghreb and southern Iberia in which the head of state wields both administrative and religious power over the people. With significantly more interaction with non-believers like the Sephardic Jews and Europeans Christians, we cannot always enforce our beliefs upon our citizens, lest we incite a rebellion. We must balance our faith with our tolerance of other practices."

 ME_caliphate_reform_sunni_arabian_desc: "Following in the footsteps of our original Caliphs during the time of the Rashiduns, the Arabian caliphate will call upon our people to elect our head of state from amongst our most faithful ulema.

 ME_Abbasid_Events.1.t: "The Abbasid Caliphate"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.1.d: "The Abbasid Caliphate, influential from about the 8th century to 13th century, was the third successive caliphate, based mostly in Baghdad. Unfortunately, after the sack of Baghdad in 1258 by the wretched Mongols, the prestige and authority of the Caliphate practically ceased to exist. In time, the Caliphate was recreated once more, this time in the Mamluk controlled Cairo in 1261. Although the Caliph continued to hold powers, the authority the position held was reduced immensely and was confined as an advisor only pertaining to religious matters." 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.1.a: "We are in control."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.2.t: "Hidden Event!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.2.d: "If you see this, then proceed to ignore it."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.2.a: "Localization was here, but it went missing."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.3.t: "Fate of the Caliph"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.3.d: "[From.GetName] has been captured by our forces as they arrived at the city. This bustling city is not home to just the wealthy Burghers, but also to one of the most important figures in our religion - The Abbasid Caliph. It is no secret that they have been used, much like a marionette, by the successive Monarchs of [From.Owner.GetName]. Should we bring him to reside in our glorious capital, [Root.Capital.GetName] , or should we leave him to his devices?"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.3.a: "We will take better care of him."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.3.b: "He belongs in [From.GetName]."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.4.t: "Caliph Flees [Caliph_province.GetName]!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.4.d: "With the imminent siege on the city by enemy forces, we have decided to evacuate the Caliph away from the fighting in [Caliph_province.GetName], and off to an alternative, safer residence. Let us hope it will not be in vain." 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.4.a: "Put him in §Y[Mamluks_target_1.GetName]§!."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.4.b: "Let him be in §Y[Mamluks_target_2.GetName]§!."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.4.c: "We can only ensure his safety by his stay in §Y[Mamluks_target_3.GetName]§!."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.4.e: "I changed my mind."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.5.t: "[From.GetName] has denounced us!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.5.d: "The vile [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has forced the Caliph, currently residing in [Caliph_province.GetName], to formally and publically denounce our recent actions. The government in [From.Capital.GetName] is manipulating the Caliph like a marionette, and using him to fulfill all manor of wicked agendas that would prove beneficial to them. Despite his somewhat limited power within their administration, this action has turned many of our fellow neighbouring Muslims against us, however mild we may have acted."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.5.a: "The puppetmaster will meet their fate."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.6.t: "[From.GetName] has praised us!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.6.d: "Word has reached us from travelling merchants returning from the city of the Caliph's residence, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. It is said that we have been blessed by the Caliph himself, courtesy of the [From.GetAdjective], and that we have their recognition of great work done in the name of Allah. Let us make use of this blessing!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.6.a: "Praise be to Allah!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.7.t: "[From.GetName] has called Jihad on us!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.7.d: "The fiends in [From.GetName] have had their Caliph call a jihad upon us! We must brace ourselves and ready the troops, for conflict may be imminent. Let beat the drums of war, before we are surrounded by the Muslims, eager to flock to their Caliph's call." 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.7.a: "Let us show them that it was an egregious mistake!" 
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.8.t: "The Caliph's Puppetmasters"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.8.d: "We have seized control over the city in which the Abbasid Caliph resides. If he wishes to stay and live a prosperous life, he will need to follow our wishes. Serving as our political and religious puppet, he will be allowed to act with limited authority over our state matters."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.8.a: "Great!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.9.t: "Hidden Event!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.9.d: "*flushed*"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.9.a: "Okay...?"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.10.t: "Speech of the Caliph"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.10.d: "Today, the Caliph emerged from his residence, and for the first time addressed a speech directly to our people, evoking newfound piety in the misguided, inspiring the faithful and solidifying the faith of our populace." 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.10.a: "Blessed Caliph!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.11.t: "Patron of [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.11.d: "Unlike others before him, our Caliph isn't just a figurehead, created by us purely to guide and rule over the faithful - he is also a patron of the state, funding new mosques and other great works to be built in [Root.GetName]."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.11.a: "If only there were more like him!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.12.t: "Bookworm Caliph"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.12.d: "While the Caliph is religious figure first and foremost, his own interests have also led him to become a patron of the arts and a sponsor of many writers and philosophers across the country! His patronage is sure to usher a new, splendorous age of culture for us."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.12.a: "What a bookworm!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.13.t: "Caliph Confirms Legitimacy"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.13.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName], seeking stronger legitimacy to rule and silence any pretenders, has asked the Caliph to confirm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] right to rule the Mamluk State. The Caliph, of course complied with our wishes - after all, does he have a choice?"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.13.a: "No, he doesn't!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.14.t: "Surrounded by Theologians"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.14.d: "Our caliph is surrounded by many men of faith, a few of whom could really fit our court! Let us determine who will bring the best out of our nation."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.14.a: "The faithful bring benefits."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.15.t: "Caliph Flees"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.15.d: "As a result of the conquest of [Root.Owner.GetName] and our loss of control over the nearby fortifications, the city was left in the hands of the infidels. As such, the Caliph has decided to flee with his court to [Abbasid_target_1.GetName], in hopes of better protection under their banner."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.15.a: "There goes our control of the Caliph..."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.16.t: "Across the Country"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.16.d: "The Caliph wishes to relocate to another province for whatever reasons that are unknown to us. Whatever it is, we need to ensure that he remains within our control and protection."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.16.a: "Sure, let him."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.16.b: "We must stop him!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.17.t: "Abbasid Revolution"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.17.d: "The failure of our armies to achieve victory against our enemies and the exhaustion of our nation's treasury and grain supplies, the apparent corruption rife in our administration and their inability to ensure a prosperous future for our country, and the numerous laughable diplomatic failures during [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign has successively destabilised our great state. Worse still, this has motivated the Amirs to conspire against the state. Our contacts within their circles have informed us that they have apparently convinced the Abbasid Caliph to emerge from his residence, and take power as head of state for himself. Proclaiming that he, under a restored Abbasid dynastic rule, would be able to reinvigorate the nation, they have flocked to his banner in droves. Whatever words of promise the Caliph has made to them, they are now making a ruckus both outside and within our cities, citing that he is the rightful ruler of our country, and not just the religious figurehead he is."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.17.a: "Blasted fiends!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.19.t: "Caliph is Victorious"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.19.d: "Disaster! With a sizeable force at hand, the Abbasid pretender, with the support of our treacherous Ulema and their own following amongst our armies have marched from town to town, forcing each to either surrender or be put under the sword. Our own armies' blasted incompetence have been unable to put up sustained resistance in any shape or form. Many towns and their people, witnessing this, have rebelled against us, opening the gates wide and welcoming their new Abbasid ruler without resistance. As of just now, their heralds have proclaimed the re-establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate, clearly believing they are strong enough to declare themselves an independent state. Sadly, it seems that the great nation of [Root.GetName] is on its last legs." 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.19.a: "Looks like we are decadent, after all."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.21.t: "The Caliph is Executed!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.21.d: "Upon a swift and successful siege, the seemingly invicible army marched into the city in which the blasphemous Caliph resides, eager to plunder the city for its spoils. One particular group ran into the Caliph's personal residence, returning with both spoils and a prisoner in tow to their leaders. It seems as though their leaders, in a show of strength, have decided to execute the Caliph. He was brought to the capital, where under the watchful eyes of thousands of spectators, cheering for blood, was beheaded at the sun's apex on this day. The Muslims are furious, but who cares what they think?" 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.21.a: "This dreadful figure is gone!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.t: "Caliph At Our Mercy"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.d: "It seems that today, fortune has favoured us. The Caliph, a symbol of piety and prosperity for the Sunni Muslim world, has fallen into our hands upon the capture of the city where he resides. Humiliation is the least of the worries of the Sunni blasphemers, for now, we must decide what to do with him. Do we keep ahold of him, and make the Muslims pay for his freedom? Should we bring him to our own Holy Father for his own opinion and judgement? Perhaps we keep him for ourselves to control and further humiliate the Muslims, or even... put him to the sword? No matter what we choose, this is a momentous occasion in history, and the effects of what we do will ripple throughout the world!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.a: "Let us keep him hostage."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.b: "Symbol of the Sunnites! Execute him!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.c: "Make him beg for mercy and serve [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.e: "Force him to accept the Occulation."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.f: "Judgement belongs to God alone."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.g: "Send him to the Holy Father."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.22.last: "Don't touch him."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.23.t: "A Wave of Converts"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.23.d: "The Ibadi heretics, in a decisive show of strength, have been able to capture our great Caliph. Proclaiming that we Sunnis have lost our way, too decadent and stagnant in our administrations, and have prevented a possible second golden era of culture, arts and military leadership that once united the Muslims. Many of our people, now doubting the strength of their own beliefs in our Sunni teachings, have approached Ibadi scholars, asking them for renewed guidance. Waves of conversion to Ibadi are rapidly spreading throughout the Muslim world and it shows no signs of stopping. We need to make a decision swiftly, lest this momentous event invoke another schism, one that we may not be able to come back from..." 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.23.a: "We are losing ground..."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.23.b: "Fools! Let them convert."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.24.t: "Guiding Our State"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.24.d: "It now comes time to choose how we guide our state for the future. The Iqta system has been a tried and true method that a large portion of the Muslim world employ to main a successful rule over their subjects, and perhaps we can employ this traditional system ourselves. Or, we could empower our religious scholars as a pious nation, strengthen our faith and enforce our duty to Allah and the Caliph. Whatever we decide should be the best for our nation going forward."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.24.a: "The traditional Iqta system is reliable."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.24.b: "We cannot deny the Theocratic nature of our state."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.24.c: "Neither! I prefer what we do right now."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.25.t: "The Pope Above the Caliph"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.25.d: "On this faithful day, during the Holy Father's afternoon prayer, an emissary from [From.GetName] dared disrupt His Holiness' Lord's Prayer while pledging that an event of the highest order of importance has occured. Indeed, as envoy's words reached the Pope, he immediately finished his prayer and returned to St. Peter's Basilica in order to welcome the caravan from [From.GetName] filled to the brim with diplomats, ambassadors and prisoners of war brought from their ongoing crusade. Shockingly, among the prisoners would be the Caliph himself.\n\nIt was all but a hearsay, the devout followers of Christ in [From.GetName] have indeed taken one of the most important figures of Sunni Islam during one of their Holy Wars. With their utmost piety, they decided to bring that fiend straight to His Holiness, rather to deal with him on his own. The [From.GetAdjective] made the Caliph get on his knees, who was to be await the Papal judgement on his fate.\n\nThen the Holy Father uttered these words:\n<...>, which a translator brought by the [From.GetAdjective] promptly reinterpreted." #I think this loc is actually sufficient :) :yeschad:
 ME_Abbasid_Events.25.a: "\"Accept Jesus as thy Lord, or thou shalt perish!\""
 ME_Abbasid_Events.25.b: "\"I wonder how much you are worth to your fellow Muslims.\""
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.26.t: "Caliphal Forces Reorganize"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.26.d: "The revelation of the Abbasid pretender rising to challenge our rule has invoked a disaster in our nation! The stories passed down through the generations, of the glory and prosperity of the lands under Abbasid rule, have motivated rebellions to rise up throughout our nation, and this fake Caliph's forces are growing by the day as nearby towns defect to them. We must put down this rebellion before it get any worse!" 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.26.a: "They will be defeated!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.27.t: "The Abbasid Revolution"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.27.d: "Glorious! Our righteous cause to restore Abbasid rule over these lands is successful. With the support of the faithful Ulema, our righteous Amirs and the faithful people, we have managed to carve out a reinvigorated nation from the corpse of a stagnant, decaying state. Ever since the fall of Baghdad and its burning by the Mongols in 1258, the Abbasid Caliph was, for a long time, relegated to a simple position of a figurehead, a puppethead at the whims of its puppetmaster to push religious agendas benefical purely for the Mamluk state. Instead of the mighty head of state the Caliph was during the golden age of Abbasid rule, he was confined to his residence, told to only come out when he was needed to speak to the corrupt administrators and legitimise their actions. No more!\n\nThe Abbasid Caliphate has returned, and the Caliph shall return as the rightful ruler of our glorious state. Once more, he shall guide us and the rest of the Muslim world to a new golden age of culture and prosperity! Let us spread word to every corner of the Muslim world, for this second coming of the Abbasid Caliphate is a momentous occasion for everyone." 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.27.a: "The rightful Caliphs are back!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.28.t: "Powerful Caliphal Faction"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.28.d: "Blast! The wretched amirs, under the banner of the newly empowered Abbasid Caliph, have amassed too much power within our nation. Already, they have taken control of a majority of our nation, and have all but demanded that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] accept their ultimatum to recognise the founding of the Abbasid Caliphate from our occupied lands. If we do not, there may be unforetold consequences that we will never be able to recover from, and the downfall of our nation will likely come in the end anyways."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.28.a: "Let the Caliph go."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.28.b: "We must keep him at all costs!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.29.t: "Supremacy Over the Caliph"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.29.d: "As the last of the rebellious towns have been firmly re-established under our control, a decisive victory over the rebellion has been achieved. The misguided cause under the Caliphal faction supported by the amirs has been quashed, their armies laying down their arms, and word of the name of the pretender has finally died down. Whatever they have set out to achieve, it will never come to pass, their control over the state diminished as punishment. With peace restored within our borders, we can now look outwards once more." 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.29.a: "Crisis Averted!"
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.30.t: "The Talents of [temp_aba_target.GetName]"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.30.d: "As our great Caliphate grows ever bigger and more prosperous, and our diplomatic ties grow stronger, other nations in the Muslim world are more willing to work with us and our great Caliph. In particular, talented individuals hailing from the progressive nation of [temp_aba_target.GetName] are eager to impress, recently arriving at our city gates and hoping to be employed in our court. Scholars specialising in the words of the Quran are aiming to make a difference in our administration, translators of many languages ready to be of great support to our diplomatic envoys, and military philosophers bringing enlightenment and new strategies simultaneously for our armies are all here, waiting at our call."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.30.a: "A particular §YQuran Scholar§! is of our interest."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.30.b: "We need to employ a §YTranslator§!!"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.30.c: "An ambitious §YMilitary Treatise Writer§! is what we need the most."
 ME_Abbasid_Events.30.e: "Not now."
 
 ME_Abbasid_Events.31.t: "Help from [temp_caliph.GetName]"
 ME_Abbasid_Events.31.d: "Great news, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! The Caliph, [temp_caliph.GetName], hearing word of our righteous war against the non-believers, have legitimised our cause! Already, there are soldiers from across their lands arriving at our borders, their arms at the ready and asking to join the war. Military experts recently employed as advisors to the Caliph himself have sent word of their assistance in the coming days. Surely, the cause cannot fail now with such an emphatic show of support. Blessed be the Caliph, and glory to the great nation of [Root.GetName]!"
