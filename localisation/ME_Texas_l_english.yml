 #1st column
 tex_rio_grandean_infrastructure_title: "Rio Grandean Infrastucture"
 tex_rio_grandean_infrastructure_desc: "The mighty heart of the Rio Grande and Galveston Bay are both the most mercantile regions of our nation and continue to fund our settlement of the plains and our development. However, the coast is still riddled with empty beaches that have not yet been converted into industrial buildings and commercial centers. For the continued prosperity of Texas, we should industralize the coast and monopolize our valuable coastline."
 tex_augment_rio_grande_title: "Augment the Rio Grande"
 tex_augment_rio_grande_desc: "Recently, our army's finest engineers have recommended that with relatively manageable building projects we can make the Rio Grande navigable for the majority of our southern border. With more ships sailing along the river, we can guarantee that trade in the area will flourish and that we can easily travel from El Paso to the Galveston Bay in no time."
 #2nd column
 tex_consolidate_authority_title: "Consolidate Authority"
 tex_consolidate_authority_desc: "We may stand tall, but the heavy burden we shoulder cannot remain, or the government shall collapse. We need to reassert authority over Texas before we fall to chaos."
 tex_native_destiny_title: "The Native Destiny"
 tex_native_destiny_desc: "The many Indian tribes that live in our settlements and raid our frontiers repel any settlements froms growing and they slaughter our innocent civillians. The best option for us is to either eradicate them or civilize them in the ways of our people."
 #2nd column Native
 tex_native_civilization_title: "Native Civilization"
 tex_native_civilization_desc: "No matter how barbaric the natives are, the best way to end this threat is through rehabilitation. We should build schools and universities and educate them in the ways of civilization."
 tex_caddoan_agreement_title: "Caddoan Agreement"
 tex_caddoan_agreement_desc: "The Caddoan Indians are one of the few tribes that are willing to agree to an armistice with us. We should probably take advantage of their gullibleness and strike a deal that will benefit us more than them."
 #2nd column Texan
 tex_exclusive_texas_title: "Only Texans in Texas"
 tex_exclusive_texas_desc: "Our lands are plagued by the savage Indians who massacre our civillians and ransack our frontier settlements. No longer will this treachery be tolerated. Texas is now for Texans and Texans only."
 tex_populate_frontier_desc: "All around us is empty land that is barely populated or simply populated by the savages. Therefore, we have legitimate right to colonize and populate these lands as we please. Onwards, with glory!"
 tex_populate_frontier_title: "Populate the Frontier"
 #3rd column
 tex_texas_texans_title: "Texas is for Texans"
 tex_texas_texans_desc: "Even though we own most of Texas, the native Texan population is small and most of the land is still filled with loyalists, natives, and other non-Texans. Even if we choose to accept these people as citizens, the lack of unity within Texas Proper is worrisome."
 tex_huasteca_expedition_title: "The Huasteca Expedition"
 tex_huasteca_expedition_desc: "The Indians of Mexico are even more barbarous than the troublesome ones in our northern and western frontiers. The more civilized small republics that attempt to consolidate power are all but stable and spillovers are common. Down south, they commit inhumane blood sacrifices and squabble with each other in primitive warfare. Because of constant struggles, they all have massive standing armies that threaten our dominance over the Rio Grande.  Thus, we should seize the coast for ourselves and prevent any irrelevant tribe or republic from pestering us any further."
 tex_mexican_heartland_title: "The Mexican Heartland"
 tex_mexican_heartland_desc: "The farther and farther we advance into Mexico, the more we realize just how potent the land is. Many areas are capable of rivaling even our Galveston Bay cities and can easily become major metropolitan centers. As it stands, these lands are filled with filthy European sympathizers, Indians, and independent warlords. Clearly, it would be much better off under our control where it can prosper and flourish unlike currently."
 tex_leech_european_trade_title: "Leech European Trade"
 tex_leech_european_trade_desc: "The scheming Europeans who once terrorized us still own significant shares in regional trade because of the Trade Companies they established years ago. However, we can no longer tolerate the Europeans controlling our trade from far away. Texan trade is for Texas only, and now it is time to turn the tables and begin leeching their trade."
 tex_mighty_lone_star_title: "The Mighty Lone Star"
 tex_mighty_lone_star_desc: "In the tough American world that we plunged ourselves into, our instability threatened to topple the nation for which Texans valiantly fought and died. Hostile enemies all around us and relatively barren terrain rendered us vulnerable internally and externally, but our cities continuously flourished and we expanded past the size of  a minor republic. Now, the mighty Lone Star stands tall above all others and we will continue to prosper henceforth."
 #4th column
 tex_texan_fortification_title: "Texan Fortifications"
 tex_texan_fortification_desc: "Despite our glorious revolution and secession from our tyrannical overlords, we find ourselves in a hostile world filled with enemies with not an ally in sight. We must bolster our defenses as to not fall to foreign hostility."
 tex_westward_expansion_title: "Westward Expansion"
 tex_westward_expansion_desc: "To our west are vast plains and deserts with spots of vegetation perfect for creating larger ranches to feed our ever-growing cattle population. After all, all that stands in our way are those pesky Indians and the scorching heat. Send them to the ranch!"
 tex_rein_wild_west_title: "Rein in the Wild West"
 tex_rein_wild_west_desc: "The western frontier is widely unpopulated and most settlements are very independent of our authority. In fact, these lands have gained a reputation for being the 'Wild West' because of its high concentration of outlaws, saloons, and hookers. However, the many criminals at large that occupy these lands resent our government and threaten our control over the region. It may not be high noon, but it is high time to bring the Wild West back under our sovereignty."
 tex_advance_pacific_title: "Advance to the Pacific"
 tex_advance_pacific_desc: "The land of California nestled between the Pacific and the Sierra Nevada Range is rumored to possess vast quantities of gold. However, these lands are underpopulated and only filled with imperialist filth and seldom any Indians. We should expand the frontier to the Pacific and seize these lands for ourselves."
 tex_california_gold_mine_title: "Californian Gold Mines"
 tex_california_gold_mine_desc: "Now that we have colonized the lands of California, we have managed to tap into the massive gold mines. Vast profits have been amassed, but the mining process is tedious and production is still on a small scale. We should invest more into the gold business and become major producers of the coveted metal of the sun."
 #5th column
 tex_texan_national_army_title: "Texan National Army"
 tex_texan_national_army_desc: "Regardless of size, the keys to a powerful military are morale, discipline, and organization. Whilst our men are proud to fight for the Texan cause, our army is in dire need of reform and our organization levels are but laughable. This oversight renders us vulnerable to any scheming Europeans or nearby freedom fighters who seek to conquer our lands. It is in our best interests to professionalize our army and organize it so that it can valiantly fight for our sake and secure victories time and time again."
 tex_texan_rangers_title: "Texan Rangers"
 tex_texan_rangers_desc: "Once the scourge of the frontier, we have realized that cowboys have more worth than we ever expected. Their skill in handling them steeds is immaculate and they can control them better than the Indians themselves. Although they may be unprofessional, they surely will help swell our ranks and allow for better cavalry combat. After all, what's a Texan without patriotism and love of the army?" 
 #Events:

 ME_Texas_Events.1.T: "The Establishment of Houston"
 ME_Texas_Events.1.D: "Strategically located at the junction between the Buffalo and White Oak Bayous, Houston was destined to be a burgeoning metropolis since investors first proposed the idea. Regionally, it is positioned at a central location among our coastal population centers, and the region is already extremely potent, albeit limited by rivers that we will either have to bridge over or veer away. The plains upon which the city was founded will be a historical landmark for the Texan people and be a testament to the mighty cities of the Texan nation."
 ME_Texas_Events.1.OPT1: "It will become the new capital of our nation."
 ME_Texas_Events.1.OPT2: "We lack the funds necessary for this."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.2.T: "The Wild West"
 ME_Texas_Events.2.D: "Compared to our major metropolitan area sprawled along the coast of Galveston Bay, our western frontier is barren and underpopulated. Most settlers are hookers, escaped fugitives, and those who seek to get away from our authority in the land of outlaws dubbed the 'Wild West'. The lands referred to as the Wild West are actually very potent and we believe that the mass flatlands can be utilized as grazing grounds and ranches. However, these criminals and cowboys despise our government and threaten our authority over our recent expansionist investment."
 ME_Texas_Events.2.OPT1: "Worrisome."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.3.T: "Future of the Natives"
 ME_Texas_Events.3.D: "For generations upon generations, Texas has been the ancestral homes of the barbarous Indians, who are not even worthy of being called a 'civilized' culture. Nevertheless, it has become the home of the Texans as well and many Indians refuse to acknolwedge our settlements of their lands and wage war on our nation. Many of them raid our new frontiers and no large settlements have arisen because of this. We must choose to educate them or exterminate them in order to eclipse them and remove them as a threat."
 ME_Texas_Events.3.OPT1: "Education is more ethical."
 ME_Texas_Events.3.OPT2: "They are savages beyond rehabilitation."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.4.T: "Gold Discovered in California!"
 ME_Texas_Events.4.D: "The rumors were true! Our miners have discovered pockets in gold in Northern California, with only some being found near the Sierra Nevada. News has spread all across the land that the vast gold mines rumored to be in California exist and now many prospectors have already arrived at our shores."
 ME_Texas_Events.4.OPT1: "Gee golly!"
 
 ME_Texas_Events.5.T: "The Lone Star Triumphant"
 ME_Texas_Events.5.D: "Once, we were looked down upon by the imperialist colonial powers as a weak secessionist movement within one of their many, many colonies. When we succeeded beyond all expectations, we were still nowhere near stable or powerful. We were but a small state surrounded by enemies and land open for settlements. Through the development of our cities and our expansion into the vast frontier, we have swelled to a new zenith, and the Lone Star has come out triumphant against all odds."
 ME_Texas_Events.5.OPT1: "Texas stands strong!"

 ME_Texas_Events.6.T: "An Offer from Texas"
 ME_Texas_Events.6.D: "Instead of attempt to eradicate us like all of the other European powers, these 'Texans' have been hospitable and they have made us eager to seek an agreement as soon as possible. Recently, an offer has arrived that lists the following: \n\nCaddo would become a vassal of Texas, however they will be treated as equals to the Texan citizens. \nCaddo will voluntarily migrate near the Texan borders in order to eliminate the distance between Texas and Caddo. \n\nWe see this as a valuable deal as it allows us to assimilate ourselves voluntarily without any form of bloodshed involved."
 ME_Texas_Events.6.OPT1: "This is the ideal method of  preserving our people without suffering."
 ME_Texas_Events.7.OPT2: "This is a power move hidden behind their superficial arms of hospitality."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.7.T: "Caddoan Agreement"
 ME_Texas_Events.7.D: "Our peaceful ambitions have finally been noticed. Believing our 'true' intentions, the Caddoans have agreed to become our vassals and have migrated to lands right next to our borders. However, we still have to uphold the promises we made in the offer. This means that the Caddoan natives will be treated as our citizens as long as the Caddoans rightfully remain our vassals."
 ME_Texas_Events.7.OPT1: "Great."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.8.T: "Caddoan Refusal"
 ME_Texas_Events.8.D: "Even after we opened our arms of hospitality to the Caddoans, they have foolishly refused our offer. Now, we can justify our conquests of the lands as they have rejected any peaceful offers of subjugation."
 ME_Texas_Events.8.OPT1: "Their loss, not ours."
