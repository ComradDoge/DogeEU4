 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.1.t: "A Weaving Culture"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.1.d: "As our tribal totems stipulate, we are tribes who place much focus on herding sheep. It is then only natural, that with our settling policies the agricultural sector and the herding of sheep has formed a major part of our economy. Our lambs are farmed and sheared, and the wool is the basis of our cloth culture. It is said that the splendor and prestige of our clothes penetrates beyond the borders. Our weaving culture has become an integral part of our history and identity."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.1.a: "Splendid silks!"
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.2.t: "New Economic Incentive"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.2.d: "With the rise of our weaving industry, opportunists follow suit, seeking to exploit this new found fortune. That exactly happened, as many of our burghers seek to become weavers themselves and make a name for themselves. Many of our cities have had new guilds form to suit those needs."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.2.a: "Let the Burghers do exactly that."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.2.b: "We have a different idea in mind."

 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.4.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] have sent us an envoy suggesting an alliance. New actors on international stage, their prowess is unproven but an early alliance could result in a powerful ally later on."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.4.a: "By all means!"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.4.b: "We do not need them."
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.5.t: "Support From [From.GetName]"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.5.d: "Who would expect the recent advent of [From.GetName] would lead to us receiving unconditional support. A welcome development, let us praise God for existence of people with such values!"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.5.a: "God is Good."
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.6.t: "Future of the Flock"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.6.d: "[Root.GetName] lies at crossroads today. On one hand, we have many supporters of Tribalism, wishing a return to the steppes and construction of a state as feared as Timur's Empire. Motivated by the possible spoils and expansion opportunities, that faction has emerged as a rather loud one, especially in recent times. Their popularity is only paralleled by supporters of the sedentary faction, wishing for a formation of a state that can concentrate the powers of the city and one that can completely get rid of the tribal aspect. Ultimately, it is a choice of the monarch, but it must be remembered there is no going back."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.6.a: "We have chosen the future."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.6.b: "Let us double down on our tribalism."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.6.c: "What if we wanted to settle down?"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.6.e: "Hmmm?"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.6.f: "Perhaps we have not ready for this."
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.7.t: "Legacy of the Ottomans"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.7.d: "Before we have vanquished the Osmans, the Ottoman was an Empire on the rise. Having eliminated the Remnant of the Romans, it took over the city of world's desire and restored it. Perhaps we can follow suit in that ambition."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.7.a: "Konstantiniyye is our goal!"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.7.b: "We need not a new capital."
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.8.t: "The Cities of Persia"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.8.d: "Having conquered and developed the many cities of Persia, we ought to consider if perhaps one of the cities there isn't a better fit for our capital. Let us remember a Persian Capital is a sign of splendor and power in the Iranian World."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.8.a: "Let us place our court in §Y[429.GetName]§!."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.8.b: "The fame of §Y[428.GetName]§! goes far and wide."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.8.c: "Why not §Y[2215.GetName]§!?"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.8.e: "None, we'd rather stay where we are."
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.9.t: "Golden Fleece"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.9.d: "Many have begun comparing the golden wear of our monarchs to Golden Mythological Fleece. The Woolen industry has grown so important and powerful, the demand for it has surged. Leading to an increase in profits all across the world. We are known worldwide!"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.9.a: "A healthy lamb is a productive lamb."
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.10.t: "Making a Profit"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.10.d: "With growth of our trade and the filling of our coffers, we ought to decide on a policy on what to do with all the new found wealth. Shall we invest in our souks and build magnificent bazaars, or we could opt for something else. Perhaps saving this gold for war is a wiser choice, since war tends to drain resources like nothing else. Or perhaps we should simply reinvest intk the Persian trader guilds?" 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.10.a: "Upgrade our Souks."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.10.b: "Let us build a warchest."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.10.c: "The brilliant persian traders shall serve us!"
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.11.t: "Fate of Konstantiniyye"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.11.d: "Our vengeful hordes have taken hold of tbe glorious city of Constantine. The city has finally fallen to the besiegers and our forces have already begun pillaging. But perhaps this glorious city should not be destined for destruction?"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.11.a: "Relic of traitors! Burn it!"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.11.b: "Restore it to its rightful owner."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.11.c: "We will hold it proudly."
 
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.12.t: "Sharifate of Mecca"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.12.d: "The descendants of Hasan ibn Ali have been ruling the Holy Cities for centuries now. It cannot be said that the rule was sovereign though, for many have subjugated the sharifate and the current Sharif cannot be trusted to stay independant from others. Due to this, it might be better for everyone if we were the ones to control the Holy Cities, either directly or indirectly, via controlling the Sharif. And so we did conquer the Holy Cities, but is it a wise decision to restore the sharifate, or to protect the cities directly?"
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.12.a: "Let us establish the Sharifate of Mecca."
 ME_Qir_Qoyunlu_Events.12.b: "We will hold it directly."
