 ynz_imperial_cartog:0 "Reform the Imperial Cartographers"
 ynz_imperial_cartog_desc:0 "It has been many years since we received a dispatch from the mainland, and now we are forced to conclude that Beijing has forgotten us. It used to be that the Imperial Cartographers would deliver us the records of their expeditions on their way back to the mainland, and what little we know of this new world we know from those maps. We must take it upon ourselves to continue their work, sailing further into the horizon than ever before. Perhaps, with luck, we will find our way home again."
 ynz_trade_winds:0 "Master The Trade Winds"
 ynz_trade_winds_desc:0 "Legend tells us that the first of our nation were colonists born by strong winds to the unknown coast we now call our home. These great gales still blow as strong as they did then, and by making detailed records of their habits, our merchants will ride them farther than ever before."
 ynz_colonial_bureaucracy:0 "Colonial Bureaucracy"
 ynz_colonial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "From the moment our colony was founded, its administration was modeled off of that of Great Ming. Now, as we establish our own colonies, we shall carry on that tradition of excellence in their administration as well. With each new settlement being developed by a sophisticated bureaucratic apparatus, land improvements can be planed and directed for maximum efficiency and effectiveness."
 ynz_renew_the_mandate:0 "Renew the Mandate of Heaven" 
 ynz_renew_the_mandate_desc:0 "Where we were once a small colony dependent on a great empire, today we stand as a powerful and self-sufficient state. Are we not the greatest of this land? Do we not prosper here by divine right? Truly the heavens have given us stewardship over this new world. We are here by the mandate of heaven!"
 ynz_imperial_seal:0 "The Seal of Yingzhou"
 ynz_imperial_seal_desc:0 "Other nations may treat their merchants as mere vagrants belonging nowhere, little worth their protection. Not us. Every merchant that bears the seal of Yingzhou upon their sail and breast shall be treated as an emissary of the state, and shall be guarded abroad as such. Other nations shall know that any harm done to our merchants is a crime against our majesty, and that our retribution shall be swift. The merchant that bears the republican seal shall walk in safety in foreign lands and waters, and shall seek riskier and more lucrative deals as a result."
 ynz_beyond_the_new_world:0 "Beyond the New World"
 ynz_beyond_the_new_world_desc:0 "At last, we have made contact with the motherland, and the rest of the world along with it. But much has changed in the generations since we last sent emissaries to the Imperial court. We are now a nation in our own right, and it is time to make the world remember what they forgot. Let us show them what we have become!"
 ynz_merchants_of_the_new_world:0 "Merchants of the New World"
 ynz_merchants_of_the_new_world_desc:0 "Foreigners now arrive upon the shores of this land. Our merchants tell us that they are ignorant and bewildered. Their maps are crude and inaccurate, and nearly every day we hear reports of their merchant ships pleading for help, hopelessly lost in these new waters. With our meticulously drawn charts and maps, we possess a huge advantage over these new comers. Let us guide them to the safety of our ports, and in doing so show them who truly rules these waves!"
