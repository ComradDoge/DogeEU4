 blt_first_desc:0 "Unlike most kingdoms in Europe, our higher class does not consist of petty nobles that spend their lives inside their castles and hoarding their wealth like dragons. The dukes of our kingdom are those who are not only capable of housing an army but also brave enough to lead them personally. All who seek the title of duke is required to fight on the frontlines among their men to inspire them and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies."
 blt_second:0 "Restore the Amber Road"
 blt_second_desc:0 "Old historical records recall an ancient trade route by the name of The Amber Road. This road was used by traders to transport and sell amber, stretching as far into the Mediterranean and Egypt. Even though a long time has passed since this road was abandoned, amber is still a valuable resource, especially among wealthier societies in Europe. By reviving our trade of amber we will achieve a significant monopoly over other kingdoms in Europe that will greatly boost our economy."
 blt_third:0 "Old Traditions"
 blt_third_desc:0 "The Baltic paganism has been practiced inside our kingdom long before the arrival of Christianity and is the foundation of our very identity. Our traditions have remained the same throughout countless generations and even held against the waves of barbaric Christian crusades during the 13th century. The Christians believe that they worship the true God, but we will show them and any other heathen the true faith and our strength will be all the proof they need."
 blt_fourth:0 "Naval Hegemony"
 blt_fourth_desc:0 "The Baltic sea has always greatly impacted life in the Baltics. The Baltic Sea is the only deep waters access that we posses and as a result, the largest cities in our realm lies on its coast. Our sailors know the sea like the back of their hand and our ships are constructed to use the area to its advantage. None can challenge us on the sea that we call our home."
 blt_fifth:0 "Baltic Trade"
 blt_fifth_desc:0 "Many realms in Europe compete for control of the Baltic sea due to its wealth and influence over northern Europe. For us, control of the Baltic sea is even more important since most of our economy is subject to the flow of the Baltic trade. Thankfully we have gained control of a significant portion of the Baltic coastline, giving us greater control over which ships sail the seas. No longer will we be manipulated by those wealthier than us and we will make sure that Baltic profits go to the Baltic people."
 blt_sixth:0 "Tribal Union"
 blt_sixth_desc:0 "The Baltic Kingdom is not like most kingdoms in which a majority rules over all the other minorities. The Baltic Kingdom works more like a union of people were everyone is sufficiently represented in regional and national matters. This harmony is credited to the way our rulers regularly work with and listen to the various tribes that inhabit the Baltics, making sure that they all have the right amount of autonomy while still contributing to the Kingdom. This greater unity between our subjects will keep the nation together in times of crisis and prevent the infighting that is prevalent in other European kingdoms."
 blt_seventh:0 "Pagan Fury"
 blt_seventh_desc:0 "Throughout our history, we and our faith have been treated unfairly by those different from us. Threatened by the Slavs, almost exterminated by the Christians, and isolated from the affairs of Europe, there has been no justice for the victims and no punishment for those who are guilty. The people of the Baltic can no longer stand by and just watch as our suffering is ignored and our traditions are tarnished by heathens. Christians speak of forgetting the sins of the past and forgiving, but we in the Baltics live by a very different motto. Those who stand on the sidelines and do nothing will be swept away and forgotten by history. Everyone who has ever wronged us will suffer as we have suffered, Europe will burn in a crusade of their own, and the name Pagan will spread terror deep into the hearts of every so-called 'good Christian'."

From when dynasties collapsed into civil wars to foreign invasion coming through to Egyptian territory, conflict has often sat right along side peace in Egyptian history, one after the other.

The former is used for monumental inscriptions and writing while the latter is more for the common person to use in their daily life. Both still hold great prominence within our society but as time goes forth, we will need to refine the two systems into more structured and regimented forms so that every Egyptian person, no matter where they are, can read and understand them."
