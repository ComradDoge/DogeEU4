And who is the man chosen by the Lord's will to rule these lands? Yes, that's right... you.

This road was used by traders to transport and sell amber, stretching as far into the Mediterranean and Egypt. Even though a long time has passed since this road was abandoned, amber is still a valuable resource, especially among wealthier societies in Europe. By reviving our trade of amber we will achieve a significant monopoly over other kingdoms in Europe that will greatly boost our economy."

 blt_fifth:0 "Baltic Trade"
 blt_fifth_desc:0 "Many realms in Europe compete for control of the Baltic sea due to its wealth and influence over northern Europe. For us, control of the Baltic sea is even more important since most of our economy is subject to the flow of the Baltic trade. Thankfully we have gained control of a significant portion of the Baltic coastline, giving us greater control over which ships sail the seas. No longer will we be manipulated by those wealthier than us and we will make sure that Baltic profits go to the Baltic people."
 blt_sixth:0 "Tribal Union"
 blt_sixth_desc:0 "The Baltic Kingdom is not like most kingdoms in which a majority rules over all the other minorities. The Baltic Kingdom works more like a union of people were everyone is sufficiently represented in regional and national matters. This harmony is credited to the way our rulers regularly work with and listen to the various tribes that inhabit the Baltics, making sure that they all have the right amount of autonomy while still contributing to the Kingdom. This greater unity between our subjects will keep the nation together in times of crisis and prevent the infighting that is prevalent in other European kingdoms."

Threatened by the Slavs, almost exterminated by the Christians, and isolated from the affairs of Europe, there has been no justice for the victims and no punishment for those who are guilty. The people of the Baltic can no longer stand by and just watch as our suffering is ignored and our traditions are tarnished by heathens. Christians speak of forgetting the sins of the past and forgiving, but we in the Baltics live by a very different motto. Those who stand on the sidelines and do nothing will be swept away and forgotten by history. Everyone who has ever wronged us will suffer as we have suffered, Europe will burn in a crusade of their own, and the name Pagan will spread terror deep into the hearts of every so-called 'good Christian'."

It is from this series of events in the 1300s that we must learn from so that in the future, when disasters fall upon our land, we can rebuild whatever cities are affected in a quicker and more efficient manner."
 the_rivalry_against_venice: "The Rival of the Republic"
 the_rivalry_against_venice_desc: "Undoubtedly the largest rival to Aquileia has been the Republic of Venice. Dominated by favorable politics and in comparison to us, Venice took advantage of our internal disunity and formally annexed the Patriarchate of Aquileia in 1433 and sought to secularize our land. Their effort has been met with resistance though, and now a resurgent Aquileia is at hand and ready to combat whatever Venice might throw at us."
 sort_out_the_vassal_feuds: "Prevent Vassal Collapse"
 sort_out_the_vassal_feuds_desc: "One factor that helped lead to Aquileia's collapse in the past was internal feuding between various subjects, all of which took a toll on the administration and military we had at the time. Working on a closer level with our subject states and integrating their administration into our own at various points will help keep these feuds to a minimum, and if we can prevent any feuds from happening in the future, we will have a supremely stable state."
 under_the_guidance_of_christianity: "Guided by God"
 under_the_guidance_of_christianity_desc: "Our state is guided by the principles of Christianity more so than others in the Italian Peninsula (save for the Papal States of course), yet we don't rely entirely on Christian doctrine for our politics and military. Despite this though, our people from all walks of life are devoted to the faith and are devoted to living it out in their day-to-day lives, or at least ot the best of their ability. Bishops, cardinals, deacons, and priests are welcome in Aquileia at all times, for this land has and will continue to be a land guided by God."
 ensure_the_parliament_stays: "Institutions for the People"
 ensure_the_parliament_stays_desc: "The parliament of Friuli was once a sort of makeshift government body in the Patriarchate of Aquileia in the 1200s, but by the end of the 1200s, it had become a strong institution in Aquileia that helped voice the interests of the people of Friuli and the military of the state. Meeting up to ten times a year and especially during important vacancies of the patriarchal office, we should continue to utilize this parliament system to help build trust in the government from the ground up."

 salzburg_cathedral: "Salzburg Cathedral"
 salzburg_cathedral_desc: "Erected in 774 and renovated a variety of times afterwards, our stalwart cathedral is a symbol of the grandeur and faithfulness of Salzburg as a state. Rupert of Salzburg did good in his foundational days of starting such a magnificent structure for the heirs to his power, and now we today should do as previous rulers of Salzburg have done: keep it in the best possible condition no matter what happens."
 to_side_with_the_holy_see: "History of Papal Sidings"
 to_side_with_the_holy_see_desc: "Various controversies have rocked the Holy Roman Empire over the centuries and Salzburg, being so close to Austria whilst being a Prince-Archbishopric, has had to take sides in the various disputes. We tend to side with the Holy See and see them as the rightful powers in these political arguments which gives a degree of positive reputation with fellow Catholics, and keeping to this honesty will only help Salzburg's reputation grow in the future."
 the_notion_of_a_diet: "Convene the Diet of Salzburg"
 the_notion_of_a_diet_desc: "Despite being a Prince-Archbishopric, we cannot live without the usual institutions of a standard state. Merchants, peasants, knights and officers, and also clergy are spread throughout Salzburg and have their own interests aside from what we in the administration want. In order to help sort out these desires, we should look to convene some sort of diet for all of Salzburg so that we can better align all parts of the state toward common goals."
 choices_for_salzburgs_people: "The Choice of Faith"
 choices_for_salzburgs_people_desc: "There are those in Salzburg who think that the Protestant Reformation will bring about its destruction what with the violence spreading and the politics becoming all the more murky as time goes on. We know this is not the truth, but we cannot deny that times will be hard for our population all around. The time has come for those of Salzburg to make the choice on what their faith for the future will be."
 university_of_salzburg: "University of Salzburg"
 university_of_salzburg_desc: "Rebuilding from the mess of religious struggles is going to be difficult, but not impossible. Starting off with a university to attract both local and international scholars and theologians will help bring Salzburg back to life whilst also building its characteristic faithfulness back up to where it once was."
 strength_over_the_mercantile_class: "Clergy over Merchants"
 strength_over_the_mercantile_class_desc: "The time has come for stricter regulations to come over the merchants and burghers of Salzburg. Though we understand they have needs that Salzburg needs to address as time goes on, they bring with them more corruption and foreign interference than actual ducats into our treasury. Letting the clergy and peasants handle things will be much better for Salzburg later on."
 militarized_prince_bishopric: "Extend our Temporal Control"
 militarized_prince_bishopric_desc: "Though we are limited partially by our spiritual characteristic bestowed upon us by the Holy See, the influence of the Holy See is not as strong as it once was. We can slowly begin to take military matters into our own hands and start creating a strong military for ourselves. Perhaps even doing conquests in our own name instead of the name of the Papacy? Well, we shall see how far that goes, but we are optimistic!"

 the_diocese_of_passau_desc: "As the successor to the Diocese of Lorch, we of Passau are endowed with power and authority but only in a limited area as of today. Though some would overlook our humble diocese as nothing more than a place of Bavarians and Austrians gathering to worship, many know the great reputation Passau has from its past alongside its greatly rebuilt monasteries. This reputation will only serve to enhance the trust we have from our own people, and it will help pave the way for a bright future in Passau."
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf: "Stamp of the Wolf"
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf_desc: "If there is one matter that Passau is becoming known for as the Age of Exploration makes its way across the Old World, it is that bladed weapon manufacturing is a key component of Passau's prosperity! Our smiths stamp the blades with the glorious Passau wolf, a simplified rendering of our coat-of-arms that ensures that all know exactly where the blade has come from. These high quality weapons may not be the best against muskets but they do inspire a great many stories of heroism amongst those who use them, especially the soldiers of our own ranks."
 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau: "Inviting Religious Orders"
 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau_desc: "To help spread the good word of Passau to other parts of Europe, we should be willing to invite in various high-ranking officials from the holy orders around Europe. Franciscans, Dominicans, even Jesuits would be fitting to invite to our land so that in the future, we may attract future theologians, philosophers, artists, and other skilled people of various professions."
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau: "Heresy! Everywhere!"
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau_desc: "The Protestant Reformation does not waver in its effort to bring about ruin and destruction across the whole of the Holy Roman Empire. From east to west and north to south, princes and bishops turn on each other so that one religious side may triumph claim that they have the truest interpretation of the Bible, its theology, and the doctrines of faith itself. Passau is caught in the middle of these violent clashes and will need to choose a side before one side enforces its religious demands upon the other in our own land."
 who_should_rule_over_passau: "A Powerful Question to Passau"
 who_should_rule_over_passau_desc: "Who can rule over Passau is not an easy question to answer as some think they should be elected from a religious background instead of a meritocratic background. There are also others who think noble blood stands out and should be enthroned to Passau's highest position, but we care not for these trivial aspects. What we need to focus on is where our candidate comes from. If they come from a Bavarian family, an Austrian family, a Bohemian family, or perhaps some other family in general, they will grant us certain advantages when it comes to relations with those around us."
 revoke_the_power_from_vienna: "The Rival Diocese"
 revoke_the_power_from_vienna_desc: "Vienna is so beloved by the Austrians and Papacy that it got its own diocese... How wonderful... Though some rejoice that Vienna got this attention, we of Passau resent it greatly! The ecclesiastic power of Vienna partly comes at a cost of our ecclesiastic power! The Diocese of Vienna will not stand forever, and we of Passau will be dedicated to retaking what power was taken from us. After all is done, the various deacons and priests and other holy officials that would've gone to Vienna can instead come to Passau, as they always should have done."
 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence: "The Taste of Power"
 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence_desc: "We have tasted power in the past and as of late, though we are not in a strong position to challenge strong states around us. Even to defend ourselves, the forces of Passau are rather small and weak, ineffective at stopping any advance from neighboring princes that might be eager to dismantle our power. Taking measures to formalize and build up the military potential of Passau should be a steady project for all inside our borders."

 legacy_of_the_antipopes_desc: "Previously, when the Papacy was in a state of chaos due to where the seat of Papal power was to be set at, two bishops of Parma became Antipopes. Honorius II (in opposition to Pope Alexander II) and Clement III (in opposition to Pope Gregory VII, Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II) give Parma a legacy of partial Papal power that we should utilize whenever we can, and perhaps in the future, we should look into either usurping the Papacy for ourselves or lessening its central power from Rome itself."
 family_possessions_of_parma: "Family Obligations of Possessions"
 family_possessions_of_parma_desc: "Fiefs and holdings owned by various noble families in Parma are somewhat decentralized, not obeying every law from our central government, but they have their own benefits due to this method of governance. They pay for the upkeep in their own holdings and they also know that since Parma is in such a contested spot of the Italian Peninsula, there will need to be a great many defenders for each property they own. Let us hope that they hire men of quality instead of levying each peasant they see."
 heart_of_the_italian_wars: "Heart of the Italian Wars"
 heart_of_the_italian_wars_desc: "Parma is not known for being a strong military power, that is a fact, but it is also a fact that Parma is a great witness to the various Italian wars that rage on between Germanic, French, and Italian people. Parma must not just watch the blood spill on the floor in shock and horror, no, it must learn from the clashes of these various forces and attempt to cultivate some sort of refined military force as time goes on."
 university_and_nobles_college: "Ensuring Quality Education"
 university_and_nobles_college_desc: "We must see to it that the Parmigianos are taken care of with the best we can provide. We do not look to having a sprawling empire like the French or Spanish, we instead look to having a bustling urban center and a cultivated city full of educated and well rounded citizens. To promote our work in this area, we should certainly strive to have universities and colleges throughout Parma despite what financial costs they might incur."
 adjusting_the_power_of_barons: "Power Adjustments"
 adjusting_the_power_of_barons_desc: "Just as Parma progresses in its work to build a fine central city with a myriad of scholars and artisans living within it, Parma will need to enforce most strict laws and pass more defined legislation that outlines what rights and powers certain groups of people have. In accordance with this, adjusting the power of barons and noble families is a must, but we will not completely do away with them. If we were to cut them out entirely, Parma might face a revolt that could bring down all the prosperity it has built up so far."
 strive_for_the_future_of_ideas: "The Future of Ideas"
 strive_for_the_future_of_ideas_desc: "Our strive to educate our own people and to emphasize our importance in our local area of the Italian Peninsula has been met with opposition throughout, but the opposition has only given life to new ideas! The schools of thought we foster are to be marveled at since they are giving Parmigiano people new perspectives on life, administration, taxation, trade, diplomacy, and almost every other aspect of life and statecraft one could think of!"
 primed_for_enlightened_ideas: "Parma is Prepared"
 primed_for_enlightened_ideas_desc: "It is thanks to our will to educate our people and our willingness to confront new ideas head on that Parma is where it is. Few can doubt the quality of our schools, and fewer still can doubt how many scholars of great quality our universities give rise to. What must be done now is to spread this slowly rising standard of education toward all parts of Parmigiano society."

 alpine_trade_rites: "Alpine Trading"
 alpine_trade_rites_desc: "The mountains that divide the Italian Peninsula from the rest of Europe are rough to pass through, especially when snow blocks several passages, but Tirol is a path that can be traversed with some ease. This simple fact has made Tirol a valuable trade stop for those who wish to cross the mountains and as such makes taxing trade that comes through our land a natural thing. Safe passage is something that should always be valued!"
 tirol_castle_hold_strong: "Tirol Castle"
 tirol_castle_hold_strong_desc: "With the first castle being built before 1100, the second phase of construction happening in 1139-1140, and the final construction taking place in the late 1200s under Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tirol, this castle has served as the central piece of power for Tirol. Without it, we would not be as significant as we are nor as hard to invade. If we are to continue being a strong force in the mountain passes well into the future, it would serve us well to preserve our castle to the best extent possible."
 winter_advantages: "A Friend of Winter"
 winter_advantages_desc: "Have you ever tried to cross these moutains in the winter on foot or on horseback? Both are equally terrible endeavors and many have died trying to do one or the other for military or civilian purposes. We of Tirol know the perils of these mountains all too well and thus make it so that the winter snows work for our defensive plans instead of against our general military strategies. We will see if our enemies are dull enough to fall face first into the mountain of snow they'll face."
 mineral_wealth_of_tirol: "Silver Linings"
 mineral_wealth_of_tirol_desc: "The silver mine of Tirol is perhaps the second half of our great importance to surrounding states. Minting coins and making luxury goods from silver is valued all across Europe and thus, business is always present for Tirol. When the opportunity to improve the method of mining out this silver is around, we will be the first to take it up without question."
 invest_in_tiroler_soldiers: "The Winter Soldiers"
 invest_in_tiroler_soldiers_desc: "Tiroler troops can become some of the hardiest troops in all of Europe, they only need to be trained in such a way that they can withstand freezing temperatures and harsh terrain. Traditionally we have had no need to do this but as politics begin to change around us, we need to start thinking about how we will defend ourselves from neighboring states. How do we do this? Well, it all starts with our military, does it not?"
 italian_or_german_are_we: "The Fine Lines of Diplomacy"
 italian_or_german_are_we_desc: "Tirol has a history of being intertwined with a number of dynasties which serves to both help and hinder Tirol itself. It can allow Tirol to ease tensions and get into fine diplomatic deals at times, but it can also make for the seat of power in Tirol to be claimed by a foreign state should things go wrong. Let us play our cards as best we can and navigate this political hall-of-mirrors carefully."
 natural_experts_in_finance: "Balance the Scales"
 natural_experts_in_finance_desc: "With our diplomacy secure and our military in a fine shape, finances are where our focuses will go to next. The scales of our economy have been balanced around the grand silver mine in our land, but it won't last forever unfortunately. Thankfully the money and inflation that it has caused for us has helped make Tiroler officials adept financiers over the decades, so as we adjust our financial prospects in the future, any economic downturns will affect us in a less significant way."

 saint_liborius_desc: "Long ago, the patron saint of our city walked the earth around us. Saint Liborius, the second bishop of Le Mans, is revered by those of Paderborn for his patronage against certain ailments of the human body. Let his blessing shine down upon the ones who lead Paderborn, and the ones who serve the Prince-Bishopric from the ground up."
 the_river_pader: "The River Pader"
 the_river_pader_desc: "Though perhaps not a great river like the Rhine River, the river Pader is where we call home and it helps give us a slight bit of range with regards to our actions alongside productive potential within our farms and estates. Paderborn may not be the strongest state in terms of food production or trade income, but having a slight focus on these sectors through our home river can help things out."
 both_religious_and_secular_responsibilities: "Two Realms of Authority"
 both_religious_and_secular_responsibilities_desc: "The one who leads Paderborn is entrusted not only with religious authority, but also with secular authority. It is a daunting task for many since it requires an intelligent and careful mind that is also oriented toward heaven above, but Paderborn rulers have shown that they are capable of taming both realms of authority within Paderborn itself."
 lessons_from_dietrich_iii: "Lessons from Dietrich III"
 lessons_from_dietrich_iii_desc: "Dietrich III of Moers was a costly figure within Paderborn as he led wars against a variety of other small states that included Soest and its bishop. His wars put Paderborn into a great amount of debt, necessitating financial restructuring and a shift in how economics played out in Paderborn itself. It is from his costly mistakes that we will learn from so that we are not lured into ruinous wars that devastate our economy."
 reformers_to_our_right_and_left: "Religious Reformers of Paderborn"
 reformers_to_our_right_and_left_desc: "With the Protestant Reformation in full swing all across Europe, Paderborn has had its own share of reformers wanting to change the very nature of Paderborn's administration. We are hesitant to just let these reformers do as they please, but we cannot deny that some suggestions they bring forth are valid ways of improving Paderborn as a whole. Perhaps we can work with them and tolerate these heretics for the greater good?"
 mediate_hostilities_between_the_faithful: "Uphold Religious Toleration"
 mediate_hostilities_between_the_faithful_desc: "Be they Protestant, Calvinist, Baptist, Lutheran, or even Jesuit in religious conviction, Paderborn has come to welcome them all over time thanks to the fact that we have had strong influences from both religious sides. Enforcing a more tolerant view on religion throughout Paderborn is what will ultimately lead to it being a successful religious state in these troubling times."
 dethrone_surrounding_ecclesiastic_powers: "To Empower Paderborn"
 dethrone_surrounding_ecclesiastic_powers_desc: "We have shown time and time again how pious we are and how strong our policies are toward empowering all those of various Christian denominations inside Paderborn, yet still other bishoprics and princes around Paderborn seek to dethrone us from our rightful position of ecclesiastic authority. We must not stand by as these challenges to our authority are levied from year to year and decade to decade, no, we must fight to the bitter end and uphold the authority that Paderborn has."

 buffer_state_of_north_and_south_desc: "Our small state has been called a buffer state of sorts between the rival leaders to the north and south. Though the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States may fight over the fate of Italy's northern portion, we of Modena are a sort of balancing factor that help bolster stability between the two influential giants. Such a status is enviable by other states since we are in essence a necessary political entity that must be had around."
 modenas_prosperity: "Prosperous Modena"
 modenas_prosperity_desc: "Managing our finances and our diplomacy will allow Modena to build up internally via more infrastructure and more urbanization. Since expanding outward via conquest is quite hard where we are, why not build upwards with more functional buildings?"
 the_watchmen_of_modena: "The Watchmen of Modena"
 the_watchmen_of_modena_desc: "It is an old song by an unknown author, but the 'Song of the Watchmen of Modena' is something that gives us heart. Through the turmoil and hardships that fall upon us and those near Modena, we will find a way through it all with our guards and watchmen standing tall through the toughest of storms. Long will Modena stand and long will be look toward the future!"
 small_state_politics: "Micro-Level Politics"
 small_state_politics_desc: "Though we are small in size, the politics that flow within Modena can often have far-reaching consequences. Thankfully we can manage most of our politics through careful planning and honest deals, unlike how in larger states like Austria or France where corruption and backroom deals are rife."
 prestige_inside_modena: "Take Part in High Culture"
 prestige_inside_modena_desc: "Scholars from all across Europe are travelling far and wide, bringing their prestige and luxury wherever they go. If we can build ourselves up internally and fund the construction of some high-class educational facilities, Modena will be able to foster its own prestigious scholarly class of people."
 tangled_in_italian_politics: "Tangled in Italian Politics"
 tangled_in_italian_politics_desc: "Being in the Italian Peninsula means we are also subject to the many intricacies of Italian politics. Places such as Venice, Siena, Roma, Lucca, Genoa, and Milan all push and pull on the various political ropes found throughout the peninsula and of Modena are adding to this in the same way that they do. It is time we invest honest time and effort into working out who are the friends and enemies of Modena before we become an unfortunate victim in these lands."

 engineering_for_success_desc: "The efforts to build up Modena's internal structures has resulted in a great number of engineers and builders who are adept at capturing the exact details in luxury and functionality that we of Modena both want and need. Keeping these builders busy and active will mean we can keep Modena rising up the ranks of prestige and wealth for the entire region."

 old_stronghold_of_wettins_desc: "In the times of old, the Wettin Dynasty ruled over Meissen for a good couple centuries before going extinct and being merged with the Electorate of Saxony. Though the Wettin Dynasty is relegated to the annals of history, we of Meissen in this current age benefit from the work they did to build up the lands of Meissen. Honoring them through public acknowledgements in ceremonies and building up from where they left off will ensure that we have a lasting legacy in the land."
 margrave_landgrave_burgrave: "Holy Roman Benefits"
 margrave_landgrave_burgrave_desc: "Though ranking systems in both politics and military matters are very complex and decentralized in the Holy Roman Empire, Meissen is one many that benefits from the military side of things. Ranked typically at that of a Margravate alongside a Burgravate, we can use this position of ours to keep our military cadre in line since on a small scale like in Meissen, things are generally easier to keep track of."
 claims_from_saxony: "Old Claims, Revived"
 claims_from_saxony_desc: "Meissen is often seen as from a previous era when Stem Duchies were still a recent memory and East Francia was still something that people called upon for claims and such. Despite the amount of time that has passed though, Meissen can still press claims from long ago that it once had and see to it that claims from the Electorate of Saxony are partially enforced too (though the later is something that needs more work since we are not exactly the Electorate of Saxony)."
 old_influences_around_the_hre: "Old Influences, Renewed"
 old_influences_around_the_hre_desc: "Meissen was influential in these olden times as well, having connections in many places thanks to the prominence of the Wettin Dynasty. If we can rekindle these old relationships and take advantage of what ties we still have whilst also building up new ties to other dynasties, Meissen will be in a much stronger position diplomatically."
 establish_a_religious_stance: "Religious Debate and Intrigue"
 establish_a_religious_stance_desc: "The lands of Meissen are not spared the religious fire of the Protestant Reformation and it forces us to confront the burning question at hand: Do we choose Catholicism, Protestantism, or one of the various Reformed branches? It isn't a simple cut-and-dry answer for many states and we of Meissen struggle wit the religious debate here and there, but we need to have an answer before religious conflict ruins us. Once our stance is firmly shaped, we can work toward uniting our own people around it."
 education_up_to_meissener_standards: "Meissen Schools"
 education_up_to_meissener_standards_desc: "Out of the fires of religious conflict and new ideas being spread around, Meissen is seeing a blooming interest in education and schooling. Building up not only universities, but libraries and small-scale schools could seriously help our people learn to read, write, and learn new subjects so that we can eventually have a more productive and lively society."
 the_question_of_porcelain: "Porcelain?"
 the_question_of_porcelain_desc: "Meissen's many connections in the Holy Roman Empire and its neighboring states has granted it access to a number of luxury goods from foreign places, but none of these foreign goods are quite as interesting to us porcelain. Coming from the lands to the far east and made with immense care and precision, these works of art are seen in the highest echelons of royalty all throughout Europe for good reason. Officials in Meissen insist that we work on improving our production methods so that we can produce this kind of luxury product here since it could seriously improve our economic prospects, and who are we to say no to something like this?"

 lippe_feuds: "The Age of Feuds"
 lippe_feuds_desc: "Are we blessed by these feuds, or cursed by them? There are people who argue for both sides, but the leaders of Lippe hold firm to the latter due to the fact that capitalizing on these feuds and winning them could lead to serious territorial expansion alongside increased influence. This is a long way off though, and for now we must be content with working the fields of battle with our soldiers to enforce the claims of Lippe."
 raise_the_status_of_lippe: "Rising Higher and Higher"
 raise_the_status_of_lippe_desc: "Lippe is not just a singular town as some outsiders might think, but rather it is a collection of towns that form a state that is greater than the normal sum of its parts. Further developing these towns upward through promoting infrastructure like roads, libraries, and markets will help bolster Lippe's economic status greatly."
 what_belongs_to_lippe: "What Belongs to Lippe"
 what_belongs_to_lippe_desc: "The feuds of the past ensure that Lippe will have no shortage of expansion paths; our dynastic claims alongside the various diplomatic webs we are in help make this a reality. Thus, when we annex new territory through war, others around us will know that we are justified in our actions and those of Vienna, Prague, Munich, and other prominent places will have nothing to fear from our expansion."
 fortify_lippe_towns: "Protect our Belongings"
 fortify_lippe_towns_desc: "As we build upward and expand outward, Lippe is going to need stronger garrisons is it not? Strengthening the defensive structures we have and building more castles belonging to our royal dynasty is exactly what will help hold our realm together, especially if armies from Bohemia, Austria, or some other place come marching through to curb our momentum."
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy: "Shifts in the Shadows"
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy_desc: "It is partially thanks to our deals and practices with regards to diplomacy that Lippe is as influential as it is. The diplomatic landscape of Europe is unceasing in when and how it changes, thus Lippe needs to hold itself to the various deals it is promised over time so that it can still act accordingly. To help with this, formalizing our diplomacy with a secure office of sorts in the administration will do just the job."
 adopting_church_ordinance: "The Church Ordinance of Lippe"
 adopting_church_ordinance_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has given birth to a number of issues in Lippe that we otherwise would not have had, yet still we find that we can grow from the fires of this religious fracturing of the Catholic faith. Lippe, though somewhat divided on whether or not it desires to follow one path or another, is primed to adopt what is called a 'church ordinance' by some. Through this sort of religious constitution, we can uphold stability and peace internally throughout Lippe, at least for the time being."
 relations_with_surrounding_powers: "Tinder for the Fires"
 relations_with_surrounding_powers_desc: "We have been a subject to other states and independent at other times, meaning our connections go far throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Whilst we sustain ourselves on diplomacy and keen administrative practices, we must always be aware of the fact that we have mercenary contracts open to us in the way that others do not. Feuds and shady connections have their advantages, if you can survive to see the end of the former and utilize the latter."

It is this stalwart attitude in the face of what we know is wrong that strengthens the faith of those in Coburg, and the martial tradition that St. Maurice inherited from his time in the Theban Legion can be somewhat emulated in Coburg's own soldiers. Fight for faith, and fight for Coburg!"

 develop_the_regality_of_coburg_desc: "If we are to ever be with the highest echelons of royalty throughout Europe, Coburg must be fit to host some fine banquets and ceremonies. Doing this will of course require us to develop the land of Coburg properly and build up infrastructure to get proper building materials, hireable artisans, and competent engineers. Once we've done this, we will be well on our way to becoming a true royal state in Europe."
 the_reformation_in_coburg: "At the Edge of Turmoil"
 the_reformation_in_coburg_desc: "As the Protestant Reformation reaches out to every corner of Europe, we of Coburg cannot help but feel its harsh effects on our population. Divided down to the familial level in many cases, the Protestant Reformation is for many nothing but a horrid showing of what religious divides can do to people. But, our administration is finding good lessons in the fires of religious violence as they are realizing just efficient a tolerant and integrated administration can be."

 disconnected_and_reconnected_desc: "As all of the Holy Roman Empire knows, inheritance can be a tricky subject and it can often lead to disconnected and strangely shaped territories. Coburg is no stranger to this and our royalty are keen on seeing that any split up pieces of Coburg are united into the central royal domain. Considering how inheritance laws can be manipulated too in places around us, connecting our various pieces together shouldn't be too hard."
 royalty_preserved_in_style: "Refined Aesthetic Taste"
 royalty_preserved_in_style_desc: "As Coburg grows and becomes stronger internally, the aesthetic taste of our people is becoming more refined as well. Reviving old styles and reinventing them with more modern construction techniques and modern materials will go a long way to helping us achieve the prestige and honor that we desire, and it will also help us obtain the influence we desire with other states around us."

 invest_in_long_term_structures_desc: "And as we pursue our refined taste in artistic structures, we must not forget about the functionality in our many buildings. Whether they are simple houses and manors or places of creation like forges and foundries, these places can all benefit from Coburg's focus on aesthetics and methods of construction. As the years go by, we will see that our engineers and builders will be some of the best that Europe has to offer."

 former_kings_of_italy_desc: "The title 'King of Italy' has been a contested one for a long time, and one that has not had any serious political implications beyond the Holy Roman Empire for more than a century now. Yet our legacy lives on from when we were able to contest for this very title in the late 800s and even obtaining it for a short while with Lambert I and Lambert II of Spoleto. Though this historical light behind us is faint, we will use it as much as we possibly can to stake claims on the land around us, conquering what is rightfully belonging to those of Spoleto."
 papal_connections_and_alliances: "Friends in High Places"
 papal_connections_and_alliances_desc: "Because of the placement of Spoleto, the Papal States is and always has been a natural ally against rival states to the north and south. Cardinals and governors have done regular visits to Spoleto and make for good connections both in public and in private so that, in the future, we can better carry out any plans we have in regards to diplomacy."

 the_gift_of_spoleto_desc: "What do you want this Christmas season? Is it a new train set? A nice sweater? Well how about control over Spoleto as a Christmas gift? Indeed this was somewhat the case of the centuries from about the 900s to the 1000s as Spoleto was repeatedly 'gifted' to either the Papacy or other significant political players. Though we're not going to sell ourselves out like this, being so highly valued in the past and right now has its perks."
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy: "Italian Crossings"
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy_desc: "Spoleto itself is situated in a rather 'non-fertile' part of the Italian Peninsula and as such has had to contend with crossing hills for many years now. It builds up leg muscles in the short-term and helps build up effective means of navigating rough terrain in the long-term, the latter of which we are going to need for our troop movements in the future." 
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto: "Unshaken Religious Convictions"
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto_desc: "Given where Spoleto is politically and how tumultuous the religious landscape in Europe is, it would be quite the piece of news to hear that Spoleto was uprooted from its ancestral faith. It is clear that the road ahead for us must truly be that of the Catholic Church as our loyalty to the church has been unshaken for many centuries, but if our faith truly does change for something else, it must mean that new faith has a truly monumental truth or truths, no?"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy: "Loan Our Sword; Lend Your Sword"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy_desc: "Like many other states in the Italian Peninsula, we of Spoleto are well versed in the notion of mercenaries. We loan out our troops to others for a fine bit of coinage, they lend us their swords in exchange for a few bags of coin, it's all a regular thing here. The more we deal in this area of warfare, the more Spoleto will benefit from it later on."

Though not as large as other Catholic dioceses or bishoprics, it has been here for long enough that it has ties to various parts of the land that now go under new names. If we can project its claims out further, we'll be sure to have an easier time expanding without repurcussions."

 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has reached toward Ruppin just as it has reached toward every other part of Europe, yet for some it has been more damaging than rectifying. We of Ruppin must do our best to resolve the conflicts between Catholics, Protestants, Baptists, Calvinists, and whatever other denomination is within our land so that our own political establishment doesn't succumb to internal religious fissures."

 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness_desc: "Our founding between these two signature rivers may be seen to some as mundane, but we know that there is potential in these lands if we can only utilize what production methods we have currently. Clearing some forests out of the way and harnessing some irrigation for our farms in a more efficient manner would do wonders for the productivity of Ruppin as a whole."

 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims_desc: "Being part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg for as long as we have, and also seeing how many conflicts have erupted between Brandenburg and its neighbors like Saxony, Ruppiner officials know that the land we stand on it a land of claims and of strategic value. Utilizing diplomatic connections in Brandenburg, Saxony, as well as any other states we are near could help in us making moves against our local rivals."
 local_minded_officials: "Knowing our People"
 local_minded_officials_desc: "Ruppin is very much a local power, it has been ever since its inception and the people who run our administration know this very well. As such they have come to understand local politics on a much deeper level than most other states like Austria, Bohemia, or Brandenburg. Coming to terms with local politics and local authorities is perhaps one of the biggest challenges to maintaining internal peace and productivity; thankfully we of Ruppin have no trouble in this area."

Such a reputation gives others a sense that we are weak and unable to defend against attacks, but that is far from the truth. Should we be threatened, all of Ruppin will be called upon to help defend the land regardless of their faith or creed. We stand and fight for righteousness in the face of being offered a torturous peace."

 welf_pieces: "Welf Dynastic Pieces"
 welf_pieces_desc: "The Welf Dynasty is something of a prestigious and well-known name throughout Central Europe, but it was never truly a centralized dynasty that could cultivate power and challenge other strong dynasties. The way inheritance went in the Welf Dynasty meant that its holdings got split up time and time again, leaving it with very little central power unfortunately. We of Calenberg are holders of one of these 'Welf pieces' and therefore our legitimacy in this land is helped by that alone, but finding connections in our family to the Welf Dynasty could always help us in that sense too."

 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg_desc: "Traditionally, the title of 'advocatus' ('vogt' and 'vogtei' in Old High German) was given to those who were legally delegated to carry out some secular responsibilities of a feudal lord or insitution. This position may not be that common outside of the Holy Roman Empire but inside its borders, such a title brings with it more power than one might anticipate. If we of Calenberg can elevate our the power of our own Vogtei through various means (not excluding military conquest), then we will certainly be able to command more authority in our home region."
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle: "Expand Calenberg Castle"
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle_desc: "Built by Otto the Strict in 1292, Calenberg Castle has served as our place of central authority for decades upon decades now. Though Calenberg has traditionally been thought of as an undeveloped piece of land fit for only petty local authorities, Calenberg Castle stands as a place where we can project a growing sense of power from. If we renovate it and fortify it thoroughly over time, few will be able to break through its walls and threaten our power."
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald: "Oberwald and Unterwald Development"
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald_desc: "Calenberg has traditionally been known as the Lower Forest (Unterwald) whilst our other familial area, Gottingen, has been traditionally known as the Upper Forest (Oberwald). Whilst the forests do impede land development to a degree, we have proven with Calenberg Castle that developing our land is not impossible. Putting more funds toward developing strong infrastructure would actually help Calenberg a lot in comparison to other places in Central Europe, so both the Lower and Upper Forest can be of great use to us in the future as new forestry techniques come to light."

 religious_issues_brought_home_desc: "We didn't ask for the Protestant Reformation to disturb our towns and citizens, but it followed our clergy and devote people home... Now Calenberg is put face-to-face with religious tension unlike anything it has ever had to deal with, but which path is the righteous one? Which one do our people support? No matter the path that is chosen, we will take this time to concentrate on local affairs so that such a religious split like this does not spell the end for Calenberg."
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg: "The Defense of Calenberg's Towns"
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg_desc: "The various petty wars that are waged all across the Holy Roman Empire are usually nothing to note of by bigger powers like Saxony or Austria, but to Calenberg, these wars pose as threats and learning opportunities. If we can learn to fortify our towns effectively and train more local militia groups to fight back against incoming invaders, fewer and fewer enemies will dare encroach on our land for fear of what resistance they will face on the local level."
 contest_for_northern_power: "A Worthy Contestant"
 contest_for_northern_power_desc: "The lands to the north in the Holy Roman Empire are rife with surges and drops in power from various electors, princes, and bishoprics. Calenberg is part of this cycle and is proving to many in the north that it is capable of fending for itself and even becoming a true stronghold. Cultivating this power and influence amongst various cities and small princes will help them recognize our power when they eventually come into our fold."

Though the cathedral chapter may have its power on the rise, more secular authorities are seeing to it that the politics and regular administrative matters of Osnabruck are handled by competent folks of educated backgrounds. Perhaps it was the clergy that was holding us back this entire time? We may find out in the future."

 war_profits_in_osnabruck_desc: "Osnabruck's various fueds across state lines are taxing upon the local populace, but for merchants seeking new chances at making a profit, they're actually rather intriguing opportunities. Mercenary contracts offered to us are often helped out by the fact that our merchant class is willing to take these daring attempts at making a profit during times of war, so why shouldn't we use these contracts?"

 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck_desc: "With the rise of Protestanism and its various offshoots, Osnabruck is a mess with religious communities striving to have ultimate influence over the land. These disputes are often violent in nature and we can't seem to have a solid solution with favoring one side or another. It won't be a pretty ending for at least some of the people who choose a different faith than what is decided by the administration of Osnabruck."
 religious_orders_called_in: "Call Upon Holy Orders"
 religious_orders_called_in_desc: "From the Jesuits to the Augustinians, Osnabruck has been the place where a variety of these holy orders come to settle down in so that they can cultivate their influence and add to their ranks. Whilst we will refuse their influence in our daily politics, we can at least work with them on recruiting new missionaries that serve both these holy orders and Osnabruck itself."

It may be relatively new in comparison to others across Europe, but that does not mean it can't be a place for innovative work. Cultivating the university to be where new ideas spread around Osnabruck will be what helps our state stay in the realm of innovativness whilst also staying true to our faith."

Turmoil of the past be damned, we have not fallen just yet to foreign annexation and we will strive to be as independent as we possibly can. With this in mind, we will govern as we always have strived to: Justly, honorably, and righteously."

 rotenburg_castle_at_our_heart_desc: "Established in about 1195, Rotenburg Castle has remained the residency for the Prince-Bishops of Verden since its inception. It serves as a status symbol and a good defensive structure to protect Verden from any ambitious ruler of Bremen, Luneburg, or some other state, though we must always keep in mind that the castle needs to be reworked and updated as time goes on."

 love_hate_relations_with_bremen_desc: "At times we have ruled in tandem with the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, but these unions were never true personal unions of any sort. Rather, the relations between Bremen and Verden have been quite hostile at times since Bremen has more foundational power and thus more ambition. We should at least use the good relations we do have with Bremen to hire more skilled courtiers so that we of Verden can benefit from the times of peace between the two states."
 provisions_of_being_immediate: "Advantages of Imperial Immediacy"
 provisions_of_being_immediate_desc: "Much like how Bremen is of imperial immediacy, Verden has this status in much the same way. It yields a great amount of benefits for both of us, though we take it in a different direction than they do since we are more focused on building up internally instead of controlling a myriad of religious territories and such. Being of imperial immediacy will in fact attract highly skilled advisors to Verden that will be able to grant us a great amount of influence in the future."
 politics_of_the_circles: "Intricate Holy Roman Politics"
 politics_of_the_circles_desc: "The Imperial Circles are administrative groupings in the Holy Roman Empire that serve to organize common defenses and collect taxes from the land. They also help organize the Imperial Diet when it convenes, and Verden being part of one of these circles means it can step up into higher level politics as compared to what it can normally get into. Experience with these administrative groupings will help refine our diplomatic sector and also serve to help us learn about the intricacies of foreign affairs."

 military_elite_amidst_greeks_desc: "The Principality of Achaea was not greek in its founding at all, but rather it was state set up by William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin in 1205 during the Fourth Crusade. Because of this foundation and how the entire principality was structured, it was clear to all from the outset that Achaea would be a French military elite ruling over a mostly Greek populace. This comes with its risks and rewards though, ranging from potential hostilities from the Greek people themselves to knowing just how to deal with rebellious people when they rise up."
 secular_baronies_of_achaea: "The 12 Baronies of Achaea"
 secular_baronies_of_achaea_desc: "Shortly after our founding, William of Champlitte (the first Prince of Achaea) sought to flesh out a proper administration over the land. He did this in 1208-1209 when he created a commission chaired by himself and also composed of two Latin bishops, two bannerets, and five Greek magnates. This commission assessed the land and divided it up as best they could but perhaps the most stand-out aspect of this commission's work was the creation 12 secular baronies. Though we have had to adjust these baronies as time has gone on and perhaps the number fluctuates up or down as we see fit, they allow for a more efficient way of taxing our citizens."
 prince_is_first_among_equals_to_the_baronies: "The Prince's Relation to the Baronies"
 prince_is_first_among_equals_to_the_baronies_desc: "In Achaea, we do not see the prince as being ruling with absolute authority like some other states do, but rather the prince is the 'first among equals' when it comes to his relation to the baronies of Achaea. In this respect, the baronies of our land can construct castles and hand out capital punishment as they see fit whilst also serving the prince in the field and garrison for portions of the year. Alongside this, women could inherit fiefs inside of Achaea due to the laws not being entirely based upon Salic Law, thus offering a slightly wider array of people available to our court."

 a_crux_of_east_west_conflict_desc: "Founded in the midst of the Fourth Crusade and seeing our own demise in the fires of dynastic conflict and the struggles of the Byzantines, we of Achaea know exactly what fighting between eastern people and western people is like. Achaea itself has had to adapt to these prospects over the decades through constructing new castles, allying certain states, or purely learning to fight with more heart and more discipline. It is this last aspect that we must cultivate most of all though since we are in such a precarious position, for if we cannot rely on proper defenses or worthy allies, we must defend the land with our bodies and weapons alone."

 the_the_great_court_and_assizes_of_romania_desc: "All secular and ecclesiastical lords participated in the council known as the 'Grand Court', which was and still is headed by the prince. It has a large amount of authority in Achaea and its decisions are binding not only to the people below the prince, but also to the prince himself. On top of this Grand Court, the Assizes of Romania were produced between the 1200s and 1400s whilst our principality was still alive and well despite dynastic claims hampering things. The Assizes of Romania helped blend Byzantine laws with French law and has helped Achaea and other Greek polities achieve a modicum stability with regards to laws of the land."

 emulate_william_ii_villehardouin_desc: "Perhaps the greatest prince Achaea ever had, William II (reigned: 1246 - 1278) was French in descent by highly cultured in regards to almost every aspect about him. Not only was he a prince who desired land and rightfully obtained it through the conquest of the rest of the Peloponnese, he was a poet and a troubadour who achieved a flourishing literary culture within the court of Achaea itself. Though he became embroiled in the politics of the Byzantines and the other small states around in the 1200s, his legacy lives on within us and it is our duty to carry on his legacy of both a vibrant court and a grand vision of conquest combined with literacy."
 dynastic_claims_everywhere: "The Mess of Dynastic Claims"
 dynastic_claims_everywhere_desc: "The fall of the Principality of Achaea in the early part of the 1400s was the result of dynastic claims tearing away at our insides and also the then strong Despotate of Morea taking advantage of the turmoil occurring. We may have been fated to die a sorrowful death back then, but we are much stronger now compared to back then and we can capitalize on these dynastic feuds in this current age as opposed to how futile we were when various dynasties from across Europe sought out our land through inheritance or conquest."

 versus_the_crusaders_desc: "When the Frankish Principality of Achaea conquered southward under Prince William II Villehardouin, they lost at the Battle of Pelagonia against Michael VIII Palaelogus and the enemy prince was captured. Such a valuable capture in battle led to the southern part of the Peloponnese being surrendered to the Byzantines and thus, it became the heart of the Despotate of Morea. Born in fire and bloodshed, Morea's regiments of fine soldiers and cavalry know all too well that what they fight for is the livelihood of the despotate and potentially all that graciously Greek in this world."
 invitations_to_outside_settlers: "Friends of Morea, Welcome!"
 invitations_to_outside_settlers_desc: "The economy of Morea is nothing too great as the land has been used by countless generations of Greeks whilst also coming under the torment of foreign armies marching through. In order to help reinvigorate the communities who till the land, we should invite settlers to Morea and be much more open to who comes to and from our land. Encouraging upward population growth should help us rebound from the depths of economic uncertainty."
 fortifications_like_the_hexamilion_wall: "The Hexamilion Wall Emulated"
 fortifications_like_the_hexamilion_wall_desc: "The only land connection to the Peloponnese has historically been along the Isthmus of Corinth, with this passage way being guarded by the mighty Hexamilion Wall built between 408AD and 450AD, during the reign of Theodosius II. Morea must take the Hexamilion Wall as an example of what kind of fortifications it can and should build, ones that last a long time and that can be improved upon as time goes on whilst also being stationed at key strategic points so that our enemies will have the hardest time possible besieging them."
 battles_for_aegean_dominance: "Ruthless Naval Warfare"
 battles_for_aegean_dominance_desc: "Morea's navy has never been anything serious when compared to the naval forces of Venice, Naples, or any other serious Mediterannean power, but we still have had plenty of experience fighting hostile ships in small-scale battles in the Aegean Sea. We should be learning from these various naval skirmishes and trying to improve our sailors and ships as much as we can so that we can overcome any foreign threat out on the open water."
 venetian_ties_throughout_morea: "Influential Venetian Merchants"
 venetian_ties_throughout_morea_desc: "Merchants from Venice are common in the Aegean Sea; they have been for centuries and will most likely continue to spread their influence far and wide. Over where we are, Morea is perhaps the prime beneficiary of Venice's outward influence since Venetian merchants do good business with Morean traders instead of Muslim traders to the north and east. Through these Venetian merchants, we will learn to refine our own trade practices and become a Greek entrepot."
 communication_between_our_forts: "From Fortress to Fortress"
 communication_between_our_forts_desc: "The various fortifications throughout Morea are strong in their own right, but they lack proper communication between their various locations. Whether we build dirt or paved roads or try set up various stations to facilitate communication between them, Morea needs them to be able to relay messages across the land so that a more effective resistance to enemy forces may be coordinated. Even partisans from local towns can be called upon by this enhanced communication system should the times call for it."
 new_home_for_greek_power: "Haven for Greeks"
 new_home_for_greek_power_desc: "The Despotate of Morea is a dim beacon of hope for Greek people, but one that shines nonetheless. Byzantium once stood as the bastion of Greek culture and tradition, but perhaps it is time for that torch to be passed on to their children who are more capable of bearing the weight of such a legacy. Such a legacy will be guarded at all costs and the military of Morea is prepared to fight to the very last man should said legacy be threatened."

Is the university large enough to house intellectuals from even more fields of study as time goes on? The answer to that is, of course it isn't! Thus, we must be ready to build up the University of Padua with more facilities and areas of study so that we can continue to attract more righteous and forward-thinking scholars."
 insight_into_humanism: "Humanist Ideas Expanded Upon"
 insight_into_humanism_desc: "Many around us in the Italian Peninsula are concerned with theological insights, mercantile prospects, mercenary contracts, or artistic splendor. Padua, however, is concerned more with the notion of humanism combined with Christianity itself; we wish to have a population that is strongly civic minded and that can participate in civic processes that involve their land and matters that affect their own lives. Despite Padua being a small center for this new notion of humanism, we can ensure that it becomes a staple part of scholarly work in the future."
 the_council_and_credenza_of_padua: "Our Council and Credenza"
 the_council_and_credenza_of_padua_desc: "Beholden to the Paduan people and those inside our borders, the general council and the credenza (executive body) of Padua are what keep things in line for the most part. We must work to refine both administrative bodies over time with new legislation and reforms so that we can have more sharp-witted advisors and wholesome officials."
 the_upstart_city_once_again: "The Path to Paduan Prominence"
 the_upstart_city_once_again_desc: "It is not a particularly glorious or easy path, but the path to Paduan prominence is what we are destined to walk along. We must be ready for what hardships are to come, what corrupt deals we have to contend with, and what wars we will encounter along the way. Whatever comes at us though, we will remain stalwart and bear the brunt of the oncoming storm of hardships."

 HAI_ideas_bonus: "Hainautian Ambition"
 burgundian_influences_in_hainaut: "Burgundy's Imprint"
 burgundian_influences_in_hainaut_desc: "Philip the Good of Burgundy has done much to take over the lands in and around Hainaut, yet the influences he exerted over Hainautian land is something that was cause for political developments instead of just pure rebellion. The politically minded people of Hainaut saw the inept policies of the Burgundian monarchs not as a call for war at every given moment, but rather as a learning point that could later be implemented in a better form of government. Let us where these ideas are fully realized."
 calls_for_estates_general: "Call the Estates General"
 calls_for_estates_general_desc: "The policies of the Burgundian monarchs made many cities around Hainaut and also including Hainaut call for the Estates-General. This gathering of the three principle estates of the land (the clergy, nobility, and the Third Estate) is but one step toward improving upon the policies of governance that the Burgundians had put forth. Hainaut should and will improve upon the Estates-General over time and see to it that more people in the land get representation as time goes on."
 punching_above_our_weight: "Strong Than We Seem"
 punching_above_our_weight_desc: "Much like the other cities of the Low Countries, Hainaut can and has punched above its weight in battles before. When contributing to the Burgundian cause in various conflicts to defending our own land when need be, we can be sure to always hold the line in battle to the very end. Any nation that is able to get our forces on their side will surely be thankful for our support."
 lessons_of_personal_unions: "Lessons of Personal Unions"
 lessons_of_personal_unions_desc: "Many in and around Hainaut know just how these lands came under the authority of Burgundy: through the notion of personal unions. What Hainaut and its highest officials have learned from this time of being under subjugation is that flexible diplomacy and a strong royal house is what keeps certain states independent, and if Hainaut can master having a solid diplomatic sector whilst maintaining its own royal dynasty, it will be able to keep its own power safe from competition."
 consolidate_the_hainaut_economy: "Consolidation of the Economy"
 consolidate_the_hainaut_economy_desc: "As our diplomacy develops upward, our city must also develop at the same time. Through trade is where we gain most of our profits and it is through attracting more and more merchants to come to our city that we will thrive in the future. Such is the fate of places like Holland and Brabant, such will be our fate too since taxes and military conquest are something we cannot always rely on."
 lack_of_expansion_chances: "Lack of Military Conquest"
 lack_of_expansion_chances_desc: "Where we lack in military capability for conquest we will make up for in developing the infrastructure of Hainaut. As we concentrate our efforts on improving our trade outlook, it would do us well to also work to improve our markets, our defensive structures, our manors and houses, and even our military camps. Developing internally is what will help Hainaut survive in the hostile climate that is European politics."
 focus_on_diplomatic_matters: "The Diplomacy of Hainaut"
 focus_on_diplomatic_matters_desc: "If it wasn't for our time under the authority of Burgundy, where would Hainaut be? Just another province of the French? Or perhaps another prince in the Holy Roman Empire? Both are probable outcomes, but for now, Hainaut is looking upward with its diplomacy and its royalty. We work toward steadily improving the lives of our people; we work toward building stronger structures with firm functions; and most of all, we work toward making sure that we have strong allies through confident and prudent negotiations."

 no_jews_allowed: "No Jews in Strasbourg"
 no_jews_allowed_desc: "Since the pogrom of 1349 where over 1000 Jews were publicly burned to death, we have been a city free from the menace of Jewish people! We have a strict enforcement of the laws in which Jews are forbidden to stay in the city past 10PM and a special tax must be paid for any horse that a Jew would ride in on. Some would say that we take unreasonable measures to ensure that we are free from the influences of Jews, but we do not care for these opinions; we only care for the religious integrity of our dear city!"
 printing_the_deeds_of_strasbourg: "Printing the Deeds of Strasbourg"
 printing_the_deeds_of_strasbourg_desc: "Printing materials is revolutionary for many people in and around Strasbourg since it can spread information at an unprecedented rate. Though we know this power will not always be used for good, we can at least embrace the fact that printing books and manuscripts in greater numbers will help educate the population we have whilst also providing commerce potential unlike anything we have had before."
 control_of_newspapers: "Control the Weekly Newspapers"
 control_of_newspapers_desc: "Because the printing press has become a more regular thing inside of Strasbourg, newspapers have become a regular sight all throughout the city itself. Done in weekly batches usually, they are the perfect vector in which foreign powers could try to undermine our authority within the city itself, which is why we must control the newspapers as much as possible. If we are able to maintain this control despite the changes in politics around us, we will be much more stable and prosperous."
 humanist_thinking_for_christians: "Humanist Thoughts, for Christians"
 humanist_thinking_for_christians_desc: "The burst of new and innovative thoughts coming from the late 1400s and early 1500s means that Strasbourg is becoming a place where theologians and philosophers alike come to debate and expand their ideas. Though we may have severe disdain for heathens in our land, those proposing perhaps heretical ideas are more tolerable to us."
 methods_of_education_in_strasbourg: "Educate those of Strasbourg"
 methods_of_education_in_strasbourg_desc: "As the Protestant Reformation burns European cities to the core with religious strife, we of Strasbourg are doing our best to maintain a semblance of balance between Catholics and non-Catholics. If we can build a university space where these differing Christian minds can reasonably talk out their differences and sort through different doctrines in peace, we will benefit both from the peace maintained through the university space and also from the new ideas that stem from what these theologians and philosophers come up with."
 french_intrigues_in_our_land: "French Intrigue"
 french_intrigues_in_our_land_desc: "Whilst we do benefit from protections inside the Holy Roman Empire, we cannot underestimate the lengths to which the French will go to secure the lands that straddle the border of both France and the Holy Roman Empire. Strasbourg is just one of those cities and we need to ensure that our defensive measures are some of the best around if we are to halt any French advance through our land."
 independent_high_fashion: "Strasbourg High Fashion"
 independent_high_fashion_desc: "And yet, being on the border between these two gigantic powers of Europe means that we have developed a unique sense of high culture and fashion within the highest ranks of our nobility. Strasbourg may be famous for a myriad of other things, but one more thing we can add to that list is the fact that no other noble family will look quite as nice and unique as the noble families from Strasbourg."

 invasions_from_all_sides: "The Invasions of Malta"
 invasions_from_all_sides_desc: "Malta's geography both in-person and on a political map means that it is important to a variety of powers that border the Mediterranean Sea. Our gracious island has thus witnessed plenty of invasions from all directions over the centuries, and with each invasion came with it new people and new experiences that helped build up the culture of Malta. But, as we build up a firm state for ourselves, we will need to make sure these invasions of our island come to a halt via our navy and what coastal defenses we have."
 maltas_universita: "The Universita"
 maltas_universita_desc: "For quite some time, the usual body of governance on Malta has been the 'universita'. It is not as all-encompassing as a monarchy, but it serves the people of Malta well enough because of how things are geographically and politically. It would do us well if we kept the univerista and refined it over time."
 the_midst_of_the_sea: "In the Midst of the Sea"
 the_midst_of_the_sea_desc: "Malta is a threat to some small states in the Mediterranean Sea, but it is the grim reality that other states are much more of a threat to Malta itself. Being where we are in this grand sea, we will need to build more docks and shipyards to uphold a strong navy that can defend Malta whilst also promoting its trade interests in the nearby island of Sicily and the trade hub that is Tunis."
 lessons_from_tunisian_raids: "Learn from Hostile Raids"
 lessons_from_tunisian_raids_desc: "The raids from North Africa are not unknown to Maltese people, but infact they are some of the harshest measures against Malta that is just shy of declaring a formal war against us. Decades of these raids against us has given us knowledge on how to combat these raiding vessels out at sea whilst also training sailors and admirals in Malta for upcoming naval campaigns."
 vespers_linger_in_our_memory: "Remember the War of the Sicilian Vespers"
 vespers_linger_in_our_memory_desc: "Though Malta played a minor role in it, the War of Sicilian Vespers in the late 1200s made quite an impact on Maltese history. Though those circumstances that led to the war will never happen again, we can at least work to provoke similar incidents in places near Malta so that we can get involved and possibly enforce some of our 'ancestral' claims."
 defensive_dedication: "Righteous Defense"
 defensive_dedication_desc: "Despite what foreign states would have in store for us, Malta has managed to remain a bastion of freedom for itself. Iberian influences, Italian interests, and even North African incursions have not stopped us from building up our islands to where we are now, and what has helped us most in this independent time period (besides our navy) has been our stalwart fortifications. Compounding upon existing defenses and fortifying our islands even more is of the utmost importance to Maltese people as defense is the way by which we survive."
 language_distinct_from_others: "The Maltese Language"
 language_distinct_from_others_desc: "Unique to other languages near us due to its influences from Arabic and other sources other than Latin, the Maltese language is part of what makes us a true sight to behold. We can call ourselves Christian or Muslim at various points, but what we can't call ourselves is Italian, Iberian, or Arabian; we are Maltese, a true pearl in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea."

 kingdom_of_candia: "'Kingdom of Candia'"
 kingdom_of_candia_desc: "Under the rule of the Venetians, our land was known as the 'Kingdom of Candia' and was a staging ground for projecting Venetian influence outward toward the Aegean Sea. Though those days of Venetian dominance are gone, we still remember how strong of a naval presence they had around our island through both their fleets for combat and their fleets for trade. Crete should thoroughly aspire to be like Venice in this sense so that it too can project its naval presence outward."
 memory_of_the_revolt_of_st_titus: "The Revolt of St. Titus and More"
 memory_of_the_revolt_of_st_titus_desc: "The Venetian authority over Crete was not concrete and uniform in the past; Cretan people have had a long history of revolting against Venetian authority to assert the autonomy of Crete as a whole. Perhaps the largest revolt of these was the Revoly of St. Titus that happened from 1363 to 1368. Though the efforts of the rebels were not realized as Venice regained control eventually, they strived to create the 'Republic of Saint Titus' for all of Crete, an idea which has lasted to this very day. In memory and in the honor of those fellow Cretans that have fallen in battle to sustain Cretan autonomy, we carry forth in our righteous journey."
 exposure_to_foreign_innovations: "Exposed to Foreign Ideas"
 exposure_to_foreign_innovations_desc: "Venice was not completely bad in what it did for Crete and its people, we must admit that. In their time ruling over us, they exposed the Cretan people to a number of innovations and ideas that had their start in the various cities of the Italian Peninsula. This spreading of ideas and technologies must be cultivated if Crete is to proceed on as true state of its own, for learning about what others have come up with and integrating it into Crete itself is vital for staying afloat on the political scene."
 natural_defenses_of_crete: "Even the Hills have Weapons?!"
 natural_defenses_of_crete_desc: "Our island is not the most welcoming place for invaders to land on, no? Hills and rugged terrain all across the island make invading our homeland something of a Herculean task since not only do we have the terrain to back us up, we also have partisans from all across Crete ready to do battle with enemy invaders. The defensive nature of Crete will make invaders say to themselves, 'Even the hills have weapons?!' and we will laugh as we beat them back again and again."
 genoese_and_venetian_naval_legacy: "Refine the Cretan Navy"
 genoese_and_venetian_naval_legacy_desc: "Genoa and Venice fought for quite a long time for influence on Crete in the past, and even though Venice won out in the end, we still have a distinct maritime legacy in us that stems from both. In order for Crete to hold its own in wars across the Mediterranean Sea, it needs to have a stronger navy with more sailors at the ready; building docks and shipyards across Crete's coastline is the first step in this process."
 hostile_to_foreign_intruders: "Defensive Expertise of Cretans"
 hostile_to_foreign_intruders_desc: "Cretans are nothing if not resourceful when it comes to devising a defensive strategy; even our peasants know how to defend their local areas with anything from crossbows and swords to outdated gunpowder weapons. Not only this, but working in tandem with the rugged terrain makes it so that fortificatiokns built from stone are less needed. Cretan fortifications though, are some of the best ones across Europe and this is largely due in part to partisans being able to supply and assist the garrisoned defenders."
 trade_viability_empowered: "The New Trade Hub"
 trade_viability_empowered_desc:  "As Crete prospers, so does trade across the Aegean Sea and in nearby trade nodes. We cannot say exactly how profitable things will become in the future, but we can see to a fair degree that Crete itself will become a strong hub for merchants in the future. Perhaps in time, we can succeed where Venice left off in terms of trade dominance."

 ETR_2: "The Stability of Etruria"
 ETR_2_desc: "Despite what political upheavals and changes in diplomatic relations there have been over the decades, we have managed to build the state of Tuscany up from prosperous roots. We must not work to guard the traditions and prestige of Tuscany as we go boldly into the future, for there will be several people from beyond our land that will seek to usurp our power and steal what glory we have built up."

 ETR_tuscan_banking_prospects: "Banking in Etruria"
 ETR_tuscan_banking_prospects_desc: "From the humble days of banking prospects in Siena and Florence to where we are now, few could have imagined that the economy of Tuscany would be so strong. The banking sector is where a lot of this power comes from as our honest and smart bankers have taken it upon themselves to invest money, promote development, and choose wisely as to where they should stake their livelihood. Because of all of this, we can safely say: blessed are we of Tuscany who profit from these ambitions for good, and blessed will our adminsitration be should it ever need to rely on loans from internal lenders."

Those who seek insights into the scientific nature of the natural world around us and those who seek to know what answers truly lay in the stars above us at night, they will be gathered across Tuscany into one association or society of sorts so that they can collaborate and work on their studies with proper funding and equipment.

Ever careful with our own politics and our own diplomatic relations, Tuscany can be said to be one of the most well-spoken and well-meaning states sailing into the future, and when troubles rise up to sink our great state, we will fight back with the utmost care and vigor."
