 ynz_imperial_cartog_desc:0 "It has been many years since we received a dispatch from the mainland, and now we are forced to conclude that Beijing has forgotten us. It used to be that the Imperial Cartographers would deliver us the records of their expeditions on their way back to the mainland, and what little we know of this new world we know from those maps. We must take it upon ourselves to continue their work, sailing further into the horizon than ever before. Perhaps, with luck, we will find our way home again."

Now, as we establish our own colonies, we shall carry on that tradition of excellence in their administration as well.

 ynz_imperial_seal_desc:0 "Other nations may treat their merchants as mere vagrants belonging nowhere, little worth their protection. Not us. Every merchant that bears the seal of Yingzhou upon their sail and breast shall be treated as an emissary of the state, and shall be guarded abroad as such. Other nations shall know that any harm done to our merchants is a crime against our majesty, and that our retribution shall be swift.

Their maps are crude and inaccurate, and nearly every day we hear reports of their merchant ships pleading for help, hopelessly lost in these new waters. With our meticulously drawn charts and maps, we possess a huge advantage over these new comers. Let us guide them to the safety of our ports, and in doing so show them who truly rules these waves!"

They defeated us and sent us into exile beyond the Carpathian Mountains. It is clear that “us” definitely means “people and horses”, as a Cuman and his mount have one, single soul."

 mercenary_skythikon_desc: "Byzantine generals knew an enemy can be easily defeated with his own weapon, so they employed Cuman mercenaries during various battles versus the Seljuks.

Bulgarians, Wallachians, Moldavians, even Mamluks – all these kingdoms were once ruled by Cumanian dynasties. By bringing common origins and reconciling differences we can lower nationalist unrest.

 anjou_realm_of_diversity: "Realm of Diversity"
 anjou_realm_of_diversity_desc: "Our home dynasty once united so varied cultures from across all Europe, which the wisest men could not speak even half of languages spoken in kingdom and duchies of Angevins. Each of the Angevins had to adapt. We need for our rulers not to be distant monarchs, far away from common people problems, but to be caring and protective for every culture that inhabits their realm, hopefully soon as big as empires of old."
 anjou_legacy_of_dynastic_conflicts: "Legacy of Dynastic Conflicts"
 anjou_legacy_of_dynastic_conflicts_desc: "It is not easy to persuade people into fighting for succession, since most of common folk do not care about from where their suzerain comes, until he decides to close up with them – but this can be made only after winning said war! When we are in need of regular armies, we have an advantage thou: Italian condottieri, Hungarian riders, French raubritters, and even gallowglasses from the British Isles are for our disposal...

Although, from some evidence we maintain proves that the assassin was little chubby girl trained from childhood to be professional killer, we must admit it that she made a great advantage for us and she deserved a cookie. We shall call the art of monarch elimination “Advanced Dynastic Management” and teach it to our spies abroad, to help us in incoming dynastic struggles. Even if we don't murder anybody along the way, spying efficiency will rise."

 anjou_apocalypse_tapestry_desc: "Our proud heritage of cultural supremacy is best marked by an enormous tapestry presenting the end of all times, once commissioned by Duke Louis. When a story is so terrifying, enlarging it to hundreds of feet of artfully woven cloth results in inevitable shock and obedience for will of God himself. And who is the man chosen by the Lord's will to rule these lands? Yes, that's right... you. No man will flinch on the battlefield when they know obedience to the duke is obedience to our powerful God and who dies will be resurrected right after Dies Irae he saw on the tapestry."

Trade with Venice and Genoa is profitable enough that if I would give one florin to a beggar for each ten thousand florins some merchant gains, he would be rich by midnight!

So, through giving us gifts, military backup or filthy lucre they get what they want. A strong feeling of importance that we are guardians of our Lord's footsteps creates a worldwide reputation of us as honest (hah!), proud men, which is beneficial for our diplomatic look, not only among grateful brothers in faith."
