And who is the man chosen by the Lord's will to rule these lands? Yes, that's right... you.

This road was used by traders to transport and sell amber, stretching as far into the Mediterranean and Egypt. Even though a long time has passed since this road was abandoned, amber is still a valuable resource, especially among wealthier societies in Europe. By reviving our trade of amber we will achieve a significant monopoly over other kingdoms in Europe that will greatly boost our economy."

 blt_fifth:0 "Baltic Trade"

For us, control of the Baltic sea is even more important since most of our economy is subject to the flow of the Baltic trade. Thankfully we have gained control of a significant portion of the Baltic coastline, giving us greater control over which ships sail the seas.

The Baltic Kingdom works more like a union of people were everyone is sufficiently represented in regional and national matters. This harmony is credited to the way our rulers regularly work with and listen to the various tribes that inhabit the Baltics, making sure that they all have the right amount of autonomy while still contributing to the Kingdom. This greater unity between our subjects will keep the nation together in times of crisis and prevent the infighting that is prevalent in other European kingdoms."

The people of the Baltic can no longer stand by and just watch as our suffering is ignored and our traditions are tarnished by heathens. Christians speak of forgetting the sins of the past and forgiving, but we in the Baltics live by a very different motto. Those who stand on the sidelines and do nothing will be swept away and forgotten by history. Everyone who has ever wronged us will suffer as we have suffered, Europe will burn in a crusade of their own, and the name Pagan will spread terror deep into the hearts of every so-called 'good Christian'."

 BRS_unknown_origins_desc: "Various myths relate to the founding of Brescia: one assigns it to Hercules while another attributes its foundation as Altilia by a fugitive from the siege of Troy. According to another myth, the founder was the king of the Ligures, Cidnus, who had invaded the Padan Plain in the late Bronze Age."
 BRS_charlemagne_holding_desc: "In 774, Charlemagne captured the city and ended the existence of the Lombard kingdom in northern Italy. From 855 to 875, under Louis II the Younger, Brescia become de facto capital of the Holy Roman Empire. "
 BRS_arnold_of_brescia_desc: "Exiled at least three times and eventually arrested, Arnold was hanged by the papacy, then was burned posthumously and his ashes thrown into the River Tiber. Though he failed as a religious reformer and a political leader, his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency after his death among 'Arnoldists' and more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans, though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. Protestants rank him among the precursors of the Reformation."
 BRS_leagues_of_uprisings_desc: "During the struggles in 12th and 13th centuries between the Lombard cities and the Holy Roman emperors, Brescia was implicated in some of the leagues and in all of the uprisings against them. In the Battle of Legnano the contingent from Brescia was the second in size after that of Milan. The Peace of Constance (1183) that ended the war with Frederick Barbarossa confirmed officially the free status of the comune."
 BRS_the_violin_desc: "Brescia has had a major role in the history of the violin. Many archive documents very clearly testify that Brescia was the cradle of a magnificent school of string players and makers, all styled 'maestro', of all the different kinds of stringed instruments of the Renaissance: viola da gamba, violone, lyra, lyrone, violetta and viola da brazzo."
 BRS_valleys_and_lakes_desc: "Brescia is located in the north-western section of the Po Valley, at the foot of the Brescian Prealps, between the Mella and the Naviglio, with the Lake Iseo to the west and the Lake Garda to the east but it has also other important lakes like Idro and Moro. The lakes and valleys allow our soldiers to move with great haste through the land."
 BRS_capitolium_of_brixia_desc: "The primary temple in the city, it was dedicated to the cult of the Capitoline Triad. It was built in 73 AD and consists of three cellae that have preserved much of the original polychrome marble floors, while their interior walls are now a lapidarium displaying ancient Roman epigraphs."

 CAP_norman_legacy_desc: "Bari was captured by the Normans in April 1071, and Byzantine authority was finally terminated in Italy, five centuries after the conquests of Justinian I. The Byzantines returned briefly to besiege Bari in 1156, but by then, the Norman foothold was well established, and the Norman ways, which dates back to the vikings became part of our heritage."

 sponheim_and_andech_rivalries_desc: "Our founding was not without troubles as the Sponheim and Andech families sought to cripple the power of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. We did not back down when these families went against us since they threatened a bastion of God's grace on this very earth, no, instead we turned the tables on them and strived to make gains against them so as to secure our borders and our politics. These rivalries will forever be known in Aquileia's history and they will give us a strong position when taking to future rivals."
 alpine_border_of_aquileia: "The Alpine Passes"
 alpine_border_of_aquileia_desc: "The mountains to our capital's north are a hinderance to many who pass through them and controlling the select passes that allow passage during winter times can make Aquileia a valuable place. Not only this, but guarding these passes will give our miliitary more experience in harsh conditions. Training in winter weather and in defensive environments will serve to benefit Aquileia."
 lessons_from_natural_disasters: "Rebuilding from Disasters"
 lessons_from_natural_disasters_desc: "It was in the 1300s that Aquileia was at its lowest point to many. Ravaged by earthquakes and other mishaps, the capital city was nearly abandoned altogether because of these events. Thus, the capital of the Patriarchate moved to Cividale, then to Udine, and then finally to Friuli where a bustling and robust city began to grow. It is from this series of events in the 1300s that we must learn from so that in the future, when disasters fall upon our land, we can rebuild whatever cities are affected in a quicker and more efficient manner."
 the_rivalry_against_venice: "The Rival of the Republic"
 the_rivalry_against_venice_desc: "Undoubtedly the largest rival to Aquileia has been the Republic of Venice. Dominated by favorable politics and in comparison to us, Venice took advantage of our internal disunity and formally annexed the Patriarchate of Aquileia in 1433 and sought to secularize our land. Their effort has been met with resistance though, and now a resurgent Aquileia is at hand and ready to combat whatever Venice might throw at us."
 sort_out_the_vassal_feuds: "Prevent Vassal Collapse"
 sort_out_the_vassal_feuds_desc: "One factor that helped lead to Aquileia's collapse in the past was internal feuding between various subjects, all of which took a toll on the administration and military we had at the time. Working on a closer level with our subject states and integrating their administration into our own at various points will help keep these feuds to a minimum, and if we can prevent any feuds from happening in the future, we will have a supremely stable state."
 under_the_guidance_of_christianity: "Guided by God"
 under_the_guidance_of_christianity_desc: "Our state is guided by the principles of Christianity more so than others in the Italian Peninsula (save for the Papal States of course), yet we don't rely entirely on Christian doctrine for our politics and military. Despite this though, our people from all walks of life are devoted to the faith and are devoted to living it out in their day-to-day lives, or at least ot the best of their ability. Bishops, cardinals, deacons, and priests are welcome in Aquileia at all times, for this land has and will continue to be a land guided by God."

 ensure_the_parliament_stays_desc: "The parliament of Friuli was once a sort of makeshift government body in the Patriarchate of Aquileia in the 1200s, but by the end of the 1200s, it had become a strong institution in Aquileia that helped voice the interests of the people of Friuli and the military of the state. Meeting up to ten times a year and especially during important vacancies of the patriarchal office, we should continue to utilize this parliament system to help build trust in the government from the ground up."

 salzburg_cathedral: "Salzburg Cathedral"
 salzburg_cathedral_desc: "Erected in 774 and renovated a variety of times afterwards, our stalwart cathedral is a symbol of the grandeur and faithfulness of Salzburg as a state. Rupert of Salzburg did good in his foundational days of starting such a magnificent structure for the heirs to his power, and now we today should do as previous rulers of Salzburg have done: keep it in the best possible condition no matter what happens."
 to_side_with_the_holy_see: "History of Papal Sidings"
 to_side_with_the_holy_see_desc: "Various controversies have rocked the Holy Roman Empire over the centuries and Salzburg, being so close to Austria whilst being a Prince-Archbishopric, has had to take sides in the various disputes. We tend to side with the Holy See and see them as the rightful powers in these political arguments which gives a degree of positive reputation with fellow Catholics, and keeping to this honesty will only help Salzburg's reputation grow in the future."
 the_notion_of_a_diet: "Convene the Diet of Salzburg"
 the_notion_of_a_diet_desc: "Despite being a Prince-Archbishopric, we cannot live without the usual institutions of a standard state. Merchants, peasants, knights and officers, and also clergy are spread throughout Salzburg and have their own interests aside from what we in the administration want. In order to help sort out these desires, we should look to convene some sort of diet for all of Salzburg so that we can better align all parts of the state toward common goals."
 choices_for_salzburgs_people: "The Choice of Faith"
 choices_for_salzburgs_people_desc: "There are those in Salzburg who think that the Protestant Reformation will bring about its destruction what with the violence spreading and the politics becoming all the more murky as time goes on. We know this is not the truth, but we cannot deny that times will be hard for our population all around. The time has come for those of Salzburg to make the choice on what their faith for the future will be."
 university_of_salzburg: "University of Salzburg"
 university_of_salzburg_desc: "Rebuilding from the mess of religious struggles is going to be difficult, but not impossible. Starting off with a university to attract both local and international scholars and theologians will help bring Salzburg back to life whilst also building its characteristic faithfulness back up to where it once was."
 strength_over_the_mercantile_class: "Clergy over Merchants"
 strength_over_the_mercantile_class_desc: "The time has come for stricter regulations to come over the merchants and burghers of Salzburg. Though we understand they have needs that Salzburg needs to address as time goes on, they bring with them more corruption and foreign interference than actual ducats into our treasury. Letting the clergy and peasants handle things will be much better for Salzburg later on."
 militarized_prince_bishopric: "Extend our Temporal Control"
 militarized_prince_bishopric_desc: "Though we are limited partially by our spiritual characteristic bestowed upon us by the Holy See, the influence of the Holy See is not as strong as it once was. We can slowly begin to take military matters into our own hands and start creating a strong military for ourselves. Perhaps even doing conquests in our own name instead of the name of the Papacy? Well, we shall see how far that goes, but we are optimistic!"

Though some would overlook our humble diocese as nothing more than a place of Bavarians and Austrians gathering to worship, many know the great reputation Passau has from its past alongside its greatly rebuilt monasteries. This reputation will only serve to enhance the trust we have from our own people, and it will help pave the way for a bright future in Passau."
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf: "Stamp of the Wolf"
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf_desc: "If there is one matter that Passau is becoming known for as the Age of Exploration makes its way across the Old World, it is that bladed weapon manufacturing is a key component of Passau's prosperity! Our smiths stamp the blades with the glorious Passau wolf, a simplified rendering of our coat-of-arms that ensures that all know exactly where the blade has come from. These high quality weapons may not be the best against muskets but they do inspire a great many stories of heroism amongst those who use them, especially the soldiers of our own ranks."
 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau: "Inviting Religious Orders"
 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau_desc: "To help spread the good word of Passau to other parts of Europe, we should be willing to invite in various high-ranking officials from the holy orders around Europe. Franciscans, Dominicans, even Jesuits would be fitting to invite to our land so that in the future, we may attract future theologians, philosophers, artists, and other skilled people of various professions."
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau: "Heresy! Everywhere!"
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau_desc: "The Protestant Reformation does not waver in its effort to bring about ruin and destruction across the whole of the Holy Roman Empire. From east to west and north to south, princes and bishops turn on each other so that one religious side may triumph claim that they have the truest interpretation of the Bible, its theology, and the doctrines of faith itself. Passau is caught in the middle of these violent clashes and will need to choose a side before one side enforces its religious demands upon the other in our own land."
 who_should_rule_over_passau: "A Powerful Question to Passau"
 who_should_rule_over_passau_desc: "Who can rule over Passau is not an easy question to answer as some think they should be elected from a religious background instead of a meritocratic background. There are also others who think noble blood stands out and should be enthroned to Passau's highest position, but we care not for these trivial aspects. What we need to focus on is where our candidate comes from. If they come from a Bavarian family, an Austrian family, a Bohemian family, or perhaps some other family in general, they will grant us certain advantages when it comes to relations with those around us."
 revoke_the_power_from_vienna: "The Rival Diocese"
 revoke_the_power_from_vienna_desc: "Vienna is so beloved by the Austrians and Papacy that it got its own diocese... How wonderful... Though some rejoice that Vienna got this attention, we of Passau resent it greatly! The ecclesiastic power of Vienna partly comes at a cost of our ecclesiastic power! The Diocese of Vienna will not stand forever, and we of Passau will be dedicated to retaking what power was taken from us. After all is done, the various deacons and priests and other holy officials that would've gone to Vienna can instead come to Passau, as they always should have done."

 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence_desc: "We have tasted power in the past and as of late, though we are not in a strong position to challenge strong states around us. Even to defend ourselves, the forces of Passau are rather small and weak, ineffective at stopping any advance from neighboring princes that might be eager to dismantle our power. Taking measures to formalize and build up the military potential of Passau should be a steady project for all inside our borders."

Honorius II (in opposition to Pope Alexander II) and Clement III (in opposition to Pope Gregory VII, Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II) give Parma a legacy of partial Papal power that we should utilize whenever we can, and perhaps in the future, we should look into either usurping the Papacy for ourselves or lessening its central power from Rome itself."
 family_possessions_of_parma: "Family Obligations of Possessions"
 family_possessions_of_parma_desc: "Fiefs and holdings owned by various noble families in Parma are somewhat decentralized, not obeying every law from our central government, but they have their own benefits due to this method of governance. They pay for the upkeep in their own holdings and they also know that since Parma is in such a contested spot of the Italian Peninsula, there will need to be a great many defenders for each property they own. Let us hope that they hire men of quality instead of levying each peasant they see."

 heart_of_the_italian_wars_desc: "Parma is not known for being a strong military power, that is a fact, but it is also a fact that Parma is a great witness to the various Italian wars that rage on between Germanic, French, and Italian people. Parma must not just watch the blood spill on the floor in shock and horror, no, it must learn from the clashes of these various forces and attempt to cultivate some sort of refined military force as time goes on."

 university_and_nobles_college_desc: "We must see to it that the Parmigianos are taken care of with the best we can provide. We do not look to having a sprawling empire like the French or Spanish, we instead look to having a bustling urban center and a cultivated city full of educated and well rounded citizens. To promote our work in this area, we should certainly strive to have universities and colleges throughout Parma despite what financial costs they might incur."
 adjusting_the_power_of_barons: "Power Adjustments"
 adjusting_the_power_of_barons_desc: "Just as Parma progresses in its work to build a fine central city with a myriad of scholars and artisans living within it, Parma will need to enforce most strict laws and pass more defined legislation that outlines what rights and powers certain groups of people have. In accordance with this, adjusting the power of barons and noble families is a must, but we will not completely do away with them. If we were to cut them out entirely, Parma might face a revolt that could bring down all the prosperity it has built up so far."

 strive_for_the_future_of_ideas_desc: "Our strive to educate our own people and to emphasize our importance in our local area of the Italian Peninsula has been met with opposition throughout, but the opposition has only given life to new ideas! The schools of thought we foster are to be marveled at since they are giving Parmigiano people new perspectives on life, administration, taxation, trade, diplomacy, and almost every other aspect of life and statecraft one could think of!"
 primed_for_enlightened_ideas: "Parma is Prepared"
 primed_for_enlightened_ideas_desc: "It is thanks to our will to educate our people and our willingness to confront new ideas head on that Parma is where it is. Few can doubt the quality of our schools, and fewer still can doubt how many scholars of great quality our universities give rise to. What must be done now is to spread this slowly rising standard of education toward all parts of Parmigiano society."

 alpine_trade_rites_desc: "The mountains that divide the Italian Peninsula from the rest of Europe are rough to pass through, especially when snow blocks several passages, but Tirol is a path that can be traversed with some ease. This simple fact has made Tirol a valuable trade stop for those who wish to cross the mountains and as such makes taxing trade that comes through our land a natural thing. Safe passage is something that should always be valued!"
 tirol_castle_hold_strong: "Tirol Castle"
 tirol_castle_hold_strong_desc: "With the first castle being built before 1100, the second phase of construction happening in 1139-1140, and the final construction taking place in the late 1200s under Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tirol, this castle has served as the central piece of power for Tirol. Without it, we would not be as significant as we are nor as hard to invade. If we are to continue being a strong force in the mountain passes well into the future, it would serve us well to preserve our castle to the best extent possible."
 winter_advantages: "A Friend of Winter"
 winter_advantages_desc: "Have you ever tried to cross these moutains in the winter on foot or on horseback? Both are equally terrible endeavors and many have died trying to do one or the other for military or civilian purposes. We of Tirol know the perils of these mountains all too well and thus make it so that the winter snows work for our defensive plans instead of against our general military strategies. We will see if our enemies are dull enough to fall face first into the mountain of snow they'll face."
 mineral_wealth_of_tirol: "Silver Linings"
 mineral_wealth_of_tirol_desc: "The silver mine of Tirol is perhaps the second half of our great importance to surrounding states. Minting coins and making luxury goods from silver is valued all across Europe and thus, business is always present for Tirol. When the opportunity to improve the method of mining out this silver is around, we will be the first to take it up without question."
 invest_in_tiroler_soldiers: "The Winter Soldiers"
 invest_in_tiroler_soldiers_desc: "Tiroler troops can become some of the hardiest troops in all of Europe, they only need to be trained in such a way that they can withstand freezing temperatures and harsh terrain. Traditionally we have had no need to do this but as politics begin to change around us, we need to start thinking about how we will defend ourselves from neighboring states. How do we do this? Well, it all starts with our military, does it not?"
 italian_or_german_are_we: "The Fine Lines of Diplomacy"
 italian_or_german_are_we_desc: "Tirol has a history of being intertwined with a number of dynasties which serves to both help and hinder Tirol itself. It can allow Tirol to ease tensions and get into fine diplomatic deals at times, but it can also make for the seat of power in Tirol to be claimed by a foreign state should things go wrong. Let us play our cards as best we can and navigate this political hall-of-mirrors carefully."
 natural_experts_in_finance: "Balance the Scales"
 natural_experts_in_finance_desc: "With our diplomacy secure and our military in a fine shape, finances are where our focuses will go to next. The scales of our economy have been balanced around the grand silver mine in our land, but it won't last forever unfortunately. Thankfully the money and inflation that it has caused for us has helped make Tiroler officials adept financiers over the decades, so as we adjust our financial prospects in the future, any economic downturns will affect us in a less significant way."

 the_river_pader_desc: "Though perhaps not a great river like the Rhine River, the river Pader is where we call home and it helps give us a slight bit of range with regards to our actions alongside productive potential within our farms and estates. Paderborn may not be the strongest state in terms of food production or trade income, but having a slight focus on these sectors through our home river can help things out."
 both_religious_and_secular_responsibilities: "Two Realms of Authority"
 both_religious_and_secular_responsibilities_desc: "The one who leads Paderborn is entrusted not only with religious authority, but also with secular authority. It is a daunting task for many since it requires an intelligent and careful mind that is also oriented toward heaven above, but Paderborn rulers have shown that they are capable of taming both realms of authority within Paderborn itself."
 lessons_from_dietrich_iii: "Lessons from Dietrich III"
 lessons_from_dietrich_iii_desc: "Dietrich III of Moers was a costly figure within Paderborn as he led wars against a variety of other small states that included Soest and its bishop. His wars put Paderborn into a great amount of debt, necessitating financial restructuring and a shift in how economics played out in Paderborn itself. It is from his costly mistakes that we will learn from so that we are not lured into ruinous wars that devastate our economy."

 reformers_to_our_right_and_left_desc: "With the Protestant Reformation in full swing all across Europe, Paderborn has had its own share of reformers wanting to change the very nature of Paderborn's administration. We are hesitant to just let these reformers do as they please, but we cannot deny that some suggestions they bring forth are valid ways of improving Paderborn as a whole. Perhaps we can work with them and tolerate these heretics for the greater good?"
 mediate_hostilities_between_the_faithful: "Uphold Religious Toleration"
 mediate_hostilities_between_the_faithful_desc: "Be they Protestant, Calvinist, Baptist, Lutheran, or even Jesuit in religious conviction, Paderborn has come to welcome them all over time thanks to the fact that we have had strong influences from both religious sides. Enforcing a more tolerant view on religion throughout Paderborn is what will ultimately lead to it being a successful religious state in these troubling times."

 dethrone_surrounding_ecclesiastic_powers_desc: "We have shown time and time again how pious we are and how strong our policies are toward empowering all those of various Christian denominations inside Paderborn, yet still other bishoprics and princes around Paderborn seek to dethrone us from our rightful position of ecclesiastic authority. We must not stand by as these challenges to our authority are levied from year to year and decade to decade, no, we must fight to the bitter end and uphold the authority that Paderborn has."

Though the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States may fight over the fate of Italy's northern portion, we of Modena are a sort of balancing factor that help bolster stability between the two influential giants. Such a status is enviable by other states since we are in essence a necessary political entity that must be had around."

 prestige_inside_modena_desc: "Scholars from all across Europe are travelling far and wide, bringing their prestige and luxury wherever they go. If we can build ourselves up internally and fund the construction of some high-class educational facilities, Modena will be able to foster its own prestigious scholarly class of people."
 tangled_in_italian_politics: "Tangled in Italian Politics"
 tangled_in_italian_politics_desc: "Being in the Italian Peninsula means we are also subject to the many intricacies of Italian politics. Places such as Venice, Siena, Roma, Lucca, Genoa, and Milan all push and pull on the various political ropes found throughout the peninsula and of Modena are adding to this in the same way that they do. It is time we invest honest time and effort into working out who are the friends and enemies of Modena before we become an unfortunate victim in these lands."

 engineering_for_success_desc: "The efforts to build up Modena's internal structures has resulted in a great number of engineers and builders who are adept at capturing the exact details in luxury and functionality that we of Modena both want and need.

 old_stronghold_of_wettins_desc: "In the times of old, the Wettin Dynasty ruled over Meissen for a good couple centuries before going extinct and being merged with the Electorate of Saxony. Though the Wettin Dynasty is relegated to the annals of history, we of Meissen in this current age benefit from the work they did to build up the lands of Meissen. Honoring them through public acknowledgements in ceremonies and building up from where they left off will ensure that we have a lasting legacy in the land."

 margrave_landgrave_burgrave_desc: "Though ranking systems in both politics and military matters are very complex and decentralized in the Holy Roman Empire, Meissen is one many that benefits from the military side of things. Ranked typically at that of a Margravate alongside a Burgravate, we can use this position of ours to keep our military cadre in line since on a small scale like in Meissen, things are generally easier to keep track of."
 claims_from_saxony: "Old Claims, Revived"
 claims_from_saxony_desc: "Meissen is often seen as from a previous era when Stem Duchies were still a recent memory and East Francia was still something that people called upon for claims and such. Despite the amount of time that has passed though, Meissen can still press claims from long ago that it once had and see to it that claims from the Electorate of Saxony are partially enforced too (though the later is something that needs more work since we are not exactly the Electorate of Saxony)."

 old_influences_around_the_hre_desc: "Meissen was influential in these olden times as well, having connections in many places thanks to the prominence of the Wettin Dynasty. If we can rekindle these old relationships and take advantage of what ties we still have whilst also building up new ties to other dynasties, Meissen will be in a much stronger position diplomatically."

 establish_a_religious_stance_desc: "The lands of Meissen are not spared the religious fire of the Protestant Reformation and it forces us to confront the burning question at hand: Do we choose Catholicism, Protestantism, or one of the various Reformed branches? It isn't a simple cut-and-dry answer for many states and we of Meissen struggle wit the religious debate here and there, but we need to have an answer before religious conflict ruins us. Once our stance is firmly shaped, we can work toward uniting our own people around it."
 education_up_to_meissener_standards: "Meissen Schools"
 education_up_to_meissener_standards_desc: "Out of the fires of religious conflict and new ideas being spread around, Meissen is seeing a blooming interest in education and schooling. Building up not only universities, but libraries and small-scale schools could seriously help our people learn to read, write, and learn new subjects so that we can eventually have a more productive and lively society."
 the_question_of_porcelain: "Porcelain?"
 the_question_of_porcelain_desc: "Meissen's many connections in the Holy Roman Empire and its neighboring states has granted it access to a number of luxury goods from foreign places, but none of these foreign goods are quite as interesting to us porcelain. Coming from the lands to the far east and made with immense care and precision, these works of art are seen in the highest echelons of royalty all throughout Europe for good reason. Officials in Meissen insist that we work on improving our production methods so that we can produce this kind of luxury product here since it could seriously improve our economic prospects, and who are we to say no to something like this?"

 LPP_ideas_start: "Lippe Traditions"
 LPP_ideas_bonus: "Lippe Ambition"
 lippe_feuds: "The Age of Feuds"
 lippe_feuds_desc: "Are we blessed by these feuds, or cursed by them? There are people who argue for both sides, but the leaders of Lippe hold firm to the latter due to the fact that capitalizing on these feuds and winning them could lead to serious territorial expansion alongside increased influence. This is a long way off though, and for now we must be content with working the fields of battle with our soldiers to enforce the claims of Lippe."
 raise_the_status_of_lippe: "Rising Higher and Higher"
 raise_the_status_of_lippe_desc: "Lippe is not just a singular town as some outsiders might think, but rather it is a collection of towns that form a state that is greater than the normal sum of its parts. Further developing these towns upward through promoting infrastructure like roads, libraries, and markets will help bolster Lippe's economic status greatly."
 what_belongs_to_lippe: "What Belongs to Lippe"
 what_belongs_to_lippe_desc: "The feuds of the past ensure that Lippe will have no shortage of expansion paths; our dynastic claims alongside the various diplomatic webs we are in help make this a reality. Thus, when we annex new territory through war, others around us will know that we are justified in our actions and those of Vienna, Prague, Munich, and other prominent places will have nothing to fear from our expansion."
 fortify_lippe_towns: "Protect our Belongings"
 fortify_lippe_towns_desc: "As we build upward and expand outward, Lippe is going to need stronger garrisons is it not? Strengthening the defensive structures we have and building more castles belonging to our royal dynasty is exactly what will help hold our realm together, especially if armies from Bohemia, Austria, or some other place come marching through to curb our momentum."
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy: "Shifts in the Shadows"
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy_desc: "It is partially thanks to our deals and practices with regards to diplomacy that Lippe is as influential as it is. The diplomatic landscape of Europe is unceasing in when and how it changes, thus Lippe needs to hold itself to the various deals it is promised over time so that it can still act accordingly. To help with this, formalizing our diplomacy with a secure office of sorts in the administration will do just the job."
 adopting_church_ordinance: "The Church Ordinance of Lippe"
 adopting_church_ordinance_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has given birth to a number of issues in Lippe that we otherwise would not have had, yet still we find that we can grow from the fires of this religious fracturing of the Catholic faith. Lippe, though somewhat divided on whether or not it desires to follow one path or another, is primed to adopt what is called a 'church ordinance' by some. Through this sort of religious constitution, we can uphold stability and peace internally throughout Lippe, at least for the time being."
 relations_with_surrounding_powers: "Tinder for the Fires"
 relations_with_surrounding_powers_desc: "We have been a subject to other states and independent at other times, meaning our connections go far throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Whilst we sustain ourselves on diplomacy and keen administrative practices, we must always be aware of the fact that we have mercenary contracts open to us in the way that others do not. Feuds and shady connections have their advantages, if you can survive to see the end of the former and utilize the latter."

 COB_ideas_bonus: "Coburger Ambition"
 blessed_by_saint_maurice: "Blessed by St. Maurice"
 blessed_by_saint_maurice_desc: "St. Maurice of the Theban Legion in the 3rd Century was a peculiar figure and one who, according to the tales we have been passed down, refused to harm fellow Christians despite the orders from his superiors. It is this stalwart attitude in the face of what we know is wrong that strengthens the faith of those in Coburg, and the martial tradition that St. Maurice inherited from his time in the Theban Legion can be somewhat emulated in Coburg's own soldiers. Fight for faith, and fight for Coburg!"
 develop_the_regality_of_coburg: "Royalty in the Land of Coburg"
 develop_the_regality_of_coburg_desc: "If we are to ever be with the highest echelons of royalty throughout Europe, Coburg must be fit to host some fine banquets and ceremonies. Doing this will of course require us to develop the land of Coburg properly and build up infrastructure to get proper building materials, hireable artisans, and competent engineers. Once we've done this, we will be well on our way to becoming a true royal state in Europe."
 the_reformation_in_coburg: "At the Edge of Turmoil"
 the_reformation_in_coburg_desc: "As the Protestant Reformation reaches out to every corner of Europe, we of Coburg cannot help but feel its harsh effects on our population. Divided down to the familial level in many cases, the Protestant Reformation is for many nothing but a horrid showing of what religious divides can do to people. But, our administration is finding good lessons in the fires of religious violence as they are realizing just efficient a tolerant and integrated administration can be."
 disconnected_and_reconnected: "Shady Inheritances"
 disconnected_and_reconnected_desc: "As all of the Holy Roman Empire knows, inheritance can be a tricky subject and it can often lead to disconnected and strangely shaped territories. Coburg is no stranger to this and our royalty are keen on seeing that any split up pieces of Coburg are united into the central royal domain. Considering how inheritance laws can be manipulated too in places around us, connecting our various pieces together shouldn't be too hard."
 royalty_preserved_in_style: "Refined Aesthetic Taste"
 royalty_preserved_in_style_desc: "As Coburg grows and becomes stronger internally, the aesthetic taste of our people is becoming more refined as well. Reviving old styles and reinventing them with more modern construction techniques and modern materials will go a long way to helping us achieve the prestige and honor that we desire, and it will also help us obtain the influence we desire with other states around us."
 invest_in_long_term_structures: "Functional yet Prestigious Structures"
 invest_in_long_term_structures_desc: "And as we pursue our refined taste in artistic structures, we must not forget about the functionality in our many buildings. Whether they are simple houses and manors or places of creation like forges and foundries, these places can all benefit from Coburg's focus on aesthetics and methods of construction. As the years go by, we will see that our engineers and builders will be some of the best that Europe has to offer."
 the_highest_houses_of_the_land: "We Deserve the Best"
 the_highest_houses_of_the_land_desc: "Once we have achieved a sense of lasting internal peace, and once we have been able to satiate the desires of our nobility and common folk, Coburg will be fit for ascending to the highest parts of European diplomacy. The royal houses that hold the thrones of power across Europe are whom we should be interacting with regularly so that we can both bask in luxury and test our diplomatic skills in a variety of ways."

 former_kings_of_italy_desc: "The title 'King of Italy' has been a contested one for a long time, and one that has not had any serious political implications beyond the Holy Roman Empire for more than a century now. Yet our legacy lives on from when we were able to contest for this very title in the late 800s and even obtaining it for a short while with Lambert I and Lambert II of Spoleto. Though this historical light behind us is faint, we will use it as much as we possibly can to stake claims on the land around us, conquering what is rightfully belonging to those of Spoleto."
 papal_connections_and_alliances: "Friends in High Places"
 papal_connections_and_alliances_desc: "Because of the placement of Spoleto, the Papal States is and always has been a natural ally against rival states to the north and south. Cardinals and governors have done regular visits to Spoleto and make for good connections both in public and in private so that, in the future, we can better carry out any plans we have in regards to diplomacy."
 the_gift_of_spoleto: "The Gift of Spoleto"
 the_gift_of_spoleto_desc: "What do you want this Christmas season? Is it a new train set? A nice sweater? Well how about control over Spoleto as a Christmas gift? Indeed this was somewhat the case of the centuries from about the 900s to the 1000s as Spoleto was repeatedly 'gifted' to either the Papacy or other significant political players. Though we're not going to sell ourselves out like this, being so highly valued in the past and right now has its perks."
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy: "Italian Crossings"
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy_desc: "Spoleto itself is situated in a rather 'non-fertile' part of the Italian Peninsula and as such has had to contend with crossing hills for many years now. It builds up leg muscles in the short-term and helps build up effective means of navigating rough terrain in the long-term, the latter of which we are going to need for our troop movements in the future." 
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto: "Unshaken Religious Convictions"
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto_desc: "Given where Spoleto is politically and how tumultuous the religious landscape in Europe is, it would be quite the piece of news to hear that Spoleto was uprooted from its ancestral faith. It is clear that the road ahead for us must truly be that of the Catholic Church as our loyalty to the church has been unshaken for many centuries, but if our faith truly does change for something else, it must mean that new faith has a truly monumental truth or truths, no?"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy: "Loan Our Sword; Lend Your Sword"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy_desc: "Like many other states in the Italian Peninsula, we of Spoleto are well versed in the notion of mercenaries. We loan out our troops to others for a fine bit of coinage, they lend us their swords in exchange for a few bags of coin, it's all a regular thing here. The more we deal in this area of warfare, the more Spoleto will benefit from it later on."
 learn_from_the_papacy: "Teachings of the Holy See"
 learn_from_the_papacy_desc: "We should not just simply let the Papal States be a nice ally or a static rival of ours in the Italian Peninsula, especially since we have plenty of history with the Papal States via being under direct papal rule with a proper cardinal as governor. If we can uphold what we've learned from our years of being a papal fiefdom, then we will be able to make others bend to our will in similar ways that the Papacy does."

 an_old_catholic_see_desc: "Since centuries ago, after the Wendish Crusade, our small bit of land has been home to the Ruppiner See. Though not as large as other Catholic dioceses or bishoprics, it has been here for long enough that it has ties to various parts of the land that now go under new names. If we can project its claims out further, we'll be sure to have an easier time expanding without repurcussions."
 redo_our_town_walls: "New Town Walls"
 redo_our_town_walls_desc: "As old as our town is (alongside Neuruppin), the town walls erected around our central place of authority are not what they used to be. We should work on rebuilding them and constructing new defensive structures with high quality materials so that our defensive garrisons have a better chance at surviving incoming sieges."
 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation: "Hefty Religious Consequences"
 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has reached toward Ruppin just as it has reached toward every other part of Europe, yet for some it has been more damaging than rectifying. We of Ruppin must do our best to resolve the conflicts between Catholics, Protestants, Baptists, Calvinists, and whatever other denomination is within our land so that our own political establishment doesn't succumb to internal religious fissures."
 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness: "Between the Elbe and Oder River"
 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness_desc: "Our founding between these two signature rivers may be seen to some as mundane, but we know that there is potential in these lands if we can only utilize what production methods we have currently. Clearing some forests out of the way and harnessing some irrigation for our farms in a more efficient manner would do wonders for the productivity of Ruppin as a whole."
 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims: "A Place of Claims"
 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims_desc: "Being part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg for as long as we have, and also seeing how many conflicts have erupted between Brandenburg and its neighbors like Saxony, Ruppiner officials know that the land we stand on it a land of claims and of strategic value. Utilizing diplomatic connections in Brandenburg, Saxony, as well as any other states we are near could help in us making moves against our local rivals."
 local_minded_officials: "Knowing our People"
 local_minded_officials_desc: "Ruppin is very much a local power, it has been ever since its inception and the people who run our administration know this very well. As such they have come to understand local politics on a much deeper level than most other states like Austria, Bohemia, or Brandenburg. Coming to terms with local politics and local authorities is perhaps one of the biggest challenges to maintaining internal peace and productivity; thankfully we of Ruppin have no trouble in this area."
 there_is_life_in_this_body_yet: "The Folks of Ruppin"
 there_is_life_in_this_body_yet_dec: "We are not thought of as a militaristic place at all, but rather as a place of rural localities and small-time merchants and officials. Such a reputation gives others a sense that we are weak and unable to defend against attacks, but that is far from the truth. Should we be threatened, all of Ruppin will be called upon to help defend the land regardless of their faith or creed. We stand and fight for righteousness in the face of being offered a torturous peace."

 welf_pieces: "Welf Dynastic Pieces"
 welf_pieces_desc: "The Welf Dynasty is something of a prestigious and well-known name throughout Central Europe, but it was never truly a centralized dynasty that could cultivate power and challenge other strong dynasties. The way inheritance went in the Welf Dynasty meant that its holdings got split up time and time again, leaving it with very little central power unfortunately. We of Calenberg are holders of one of these 'Welf pieces' and therefore our legitimacy in this land is helped by that alone, but finding connections in our family to the Welf Dynasty could always help us in that sense too."
 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg: "The Vogtei of Calenberg"
 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg_desc: "Traditionally, the title of 'advocatus' ('vogt' and 'vogtei' in Old High German) was given to those who were legally delegated to carry out some secular responsibilities of a feudal lord or insitution. This position may not be that common outside of the Holy Roman Empire but inside its borders, such a title brings with it more power than one might anticipate. If we of Calenberg can elevate our the power of our own Vogtei through various means (not excluding military conquest), then we will certainly be able to command more authority in our home region."
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle: "Expand Calenberg Castle"
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle_desc: "Built by Otto the Strict in 1292, Calenberg Castle has served as our place of central authority for decades upon decades now. Though Calenberg has traditionally been thought of as an undeveloped piece of land fit for only petty local authorities, Calenberg Castle stands as a place where we can project a growing sense of power from. If we renovate it and fortify it thoroughly over time, few will be able to break through its walls and threaten our power."
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald: "Oberwald and Unterwald Development"
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald_desc: "Calenberg has traditionally been known as the Lower Forest (Unterwald) whilst our other familial area, Gottingen, has been traditionally known as the Upper Forest (Oberwald). Whilst the forests do impede land development to a degree, we have proven with Calenberg Castle that developing our land is not impossible. Putting more funds toward developing strong infrastructure would actually help Calenberg a lot in comparison to other places in Central Europe, so both the Lower and Upper Forest can be of great use to us in the future as new forestry techniques come to light."
 religious_issues_brought_home: "And it Followed me Home..."
 religious_issues_brought_home_desc: "We didn't ask for the Protestant Reformation to disturb our towns and citizens, but it followed our clergy and devote people home... Now Calenberg is put face-to-face with religious tension unlike anything it has ever had to deal with, but which path is the righteous one? Which one do our people support? No matter the path that is chosen, we will take this time to concentrate on local affairs so that such a religious split like this does not spell the end for Calenberg."
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg: "The Defense of Calenberg's Towns"
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg_desc: "The various petty wars that are waged all across the Holy Roman Empire are usually nothing to note of by bigger powers like Saxony or Austria, but to Calenberg, these wars pose as threats and learning opportunities. If we can learn to fortify our towns effectively and train more local militia groups to fight back against incoming invaders, fewer and fewer enemies will dare encroach on our land for fear of what resistance they will face on the local level."
 contest_for_northern_power: "A Worthy Contestant"
 contest_for_northern_power_desc: "The lands to the north in the Holy Roman Empire are rife with surges and drops in power from various electors, princes, and bishoprics. Calenberg is part of this cycle and is proving to many in the north that it is capable of fending for itself and even becoming a true stronghold. Cultivating this power and influence amongst various cities and small princes will help them recognize our power when they eventually come into our fold."

 waning_power_of_the_bishops_desc: "Despite Osnabruck's past, the power of the the bishops has been waning over the course of the 1300s and 1400s. Though the cathedral chapter may have its power on the rise, more secular authorities are seeing to it that the politics and regular administrative matters of Osnabruck are handled by competent folks of educated backgrounds. Perhaps it was the clergy that was holding us back this entire time? We may find out in the future."

 rely_upon_military_servants_desc: "The knights of old are becoming a relic of the past, but still Osnabruck has a great amount of influence from prominent military leaders and officials since they carry out the defense and offense of our land. Whilst we should not try to unduly cut these officials from power, we should be wary of what influence they have in our government even if they provide inherent benefits to us during times of war."
 war_profits_in_osnabruck: "Profits lead to Influence"
 war_profits_in_osnabruck_desc: "Osnabruck's various fueds across state lines are taxing upon the local populace, but for merchants seeking new chances at making a profit, they're actually rather intriguing opportunities. Mercenary contracts offered to us are often helped out by the fact that our merchant class is willing to take these daring attempts at making a profit during times of war, so why shouldn't we use these contracts?"
 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck: "A Religious Mess"
 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck_desc: "With the rise of Protestanism and its various offshoots, Osnabruck is a mess with religious communities striving to have ultimate influence over the land. These disputes are often violent in nature and we can't seem to have a solid solution with favoring one side or another. It won't be a pretty ending for at least some of the people who choose a different faith than what is decided by the administration of Osnabruck."
 religious_orders_called_in: "Call Upon Holy Orders"
 religious_orders_called_in_desc: "From the Jesuits to the Augustinians, Osnabruck has been the place where a variety of these holy orders come to settle down in so that they can cultivate their influence and add to their ranks. Whilst we will refuse their influence in our daily politics, we can at least work with them on recruiting new missionaries that serve both these holy orders and Osnabruck itself."
 theological_insights: "University of Osnabruck"
 theological_insights_desc: "Though the fires of religious reformation have blazed across Osnabruck, one good thing that has risen from the ashes has been the University of Osnabruck. It may be relatively new in comparison to others across Europe, but that does not mean it can't be a place for innovative work. Cultivating the university to be where new ideas spread around Osnabruck will be what helps our state stay in the realm of innovativness whilst also staying true to our faith."
 peaceable_governance: "Locked Down"
 peaceable_governance_desc: "Through just governance and having strong religious convictions, we of Osnabruck have come to secure ourselves a stable state. Turmoil of the past be damned, we have not fallen just yet to foreign annexation and we will strive to be as independent as we possibly can. With this in mind, we will govern as we always have strived to: Justly, honorably, and righteously."
