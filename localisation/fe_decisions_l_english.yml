 hokucho_nation_title: "§T@HKC Reform the Northern Court§!"
 hokucho_nation_desc: "The period of disruption and waning authority stemming from the Ashikaga Shogunate has yielded multiple chances for lowly daimyo to fill in the vacancy of various provinces and areas. Whilst there are daimyo that are only out for themselves, there are some that are seeking to undermine the entire notion of the shogunate and instead want a return to having an emperor be in power. In order to stop these upstart ideas from gaining too much traction, we should reform the Northern Court, Hokucho, and cement our position as a strong shogunate that succeeds where the Ashikaga Clan failed."
 nancho_nation_title: "§T@NNC Legitimacy of the Southern Court§!"
 nancho_nation_desc: "We cannot abide by the endless military governance of various shogunates that impose military authority over the vast swaths of Japan; the emperor has been disempowered for far too long. Perhaps if we control enough land around the old Southern Court capital of Yoshino in the Yamato province, we can begin building up the legitimacy and power of a new Southern Court. There will be those who oppose us of course, since the Ashikaga Shogunate will have several backers and clans who are eager to succeed it, but we must see to it that the emperor is upheld over the likes of the shogun."
 kenmu_nation_title: "§T@KNM The Legacy of Emperor Go-Daigo§!"
 kenmu_nation_desc: "The beginning of the Nanbuko-cho Jidai was with the revolt of Emperor Go-Daigo against the old Kamakura Shogunate since his ambition was to return Japan to a civilian form of government instead of another military government. Though his reforms and work ultimately led to the collapse of his 'Kenmu Restoration' period and the ultimate rise of the Ashikaga Shogunate after the fighting between the Southern and Northern Court, there is a legacy to be gleaned from his brief three years holding Kyoto for the Kenmu Restoration. Perhaps we can pick up where he left off, but if we do so, there will be many daimyo who oppose us openly."
 united_japan_kenmu_title: "§T@KNM Japan is United (for Kenmu)§!"
 united_japan_kenmu_desc: "The warring factions of Japan have finally been united under a strong emperor."
 lombard_league_nation_title: "§T@LML Evoca la Lega Lombarda§!"
 lombard_league_nation_desc: "The power of the Holy Roman Empire is waning more and more, but still the successive emperors have tried their hands at keeping the cities of the Italian Peninsula loyal and obedient. Fractured and disunited for a long time now, there has been little in the way of a confederation like the old Lombard League of the 1200s to stop the Holy Roman Empire's influences, but that memory of the league is certainly not lost on us nor the people of Milan, Verona, Ferrara, and many other cities. Perhaps it is time that we summon the Lombard League once more?"
 fujiwara_nation_title: "§T@FJI The Grandeur of the Fujiwara Clan§!"
 fujiwara_nation_desc: "Originating from Nakatomi no Kamatari (614-669), he was rewarded by Emperor Tenji with the grand name, 'Fujiwara'. This name became a surname for the descendants of Kamatari and his clan, the Fujiwara Clan, became one of the most powerful clans in all of Japan during the Heian Period. Much has happened since the time of our apex in the 900s to the 1100s, but we are not without our descendants and scattered power. Perhaps if the branches of the old Fujiwara Clan are united together, they can reform the likes of the old clan and bring harmony back to the cities of Japan."
 taira_nation_title: "§T@TAA The Honor of the Taira Clan§!"
 taira_nation_desc: "Commonly refered to as 'Heishi' or 'Heiki', the Taira Clan was one of the four great clans that ruled over Japanese politics during the Heian Period. All four held Japan in their hands but they always strived to control all of it somehow through military means or political moves. The Taira Clan came close after dethroning the Fujiwara Clan from power in the Hogen Rebellion and the Heiji Rebellion, but all was lost in the treacherous Genpei War that saw the Minamoto Clan rise to prominence. The descendants of the Taira Clan are still struggling for power against other daimyo, and it is our duty to unite them together and retake what is rightfully ours."
 minamoto_nation_title: "§T@MTO The Strength of the Minamoto Clan§!"
 minamoto_nation_desc: "We have a grand legacy in our blood, do we not? Being descendants of the Minamoto Clan, the one to found the great Kamakura Shogunate, there is a lot to be expected of us as the various daimyo fight amongst themselves for land and power. Those scattered children of the Minamoto Clan are weak as it is, unfortunately, for they know no central administration beyond their own small dynastic branch and often refuse to listen to whoever is the current shogun. If we can retake the old domains of the Minamoto Clan and reform the clan into something more centralized than before, we will be ready to take power across Japan."
 lombardy_venetia_nation_title: "§T@LVN Lombardi e Veneziani, unitevi!§!"
 lombardy_venetia_nation_desc: "The northern lands of the Italian Peninsula have been plagued by influence from the Holy Roman Empire to the north and the Papal States to the south. The various republics and duchies that are seeking to find a path through the harrowing times need strong and righteous leadership that stems from inside the Italian Peninsula, not outside of it. The various people of the north though... They do not seem to be capable of carving out a state strong enough to claim this position; it seems to only be the Lombards and Venetians who are able to. If they can set aside their differences and come together somehow, perhaps a brighter and more unified future is possible."
 huaxyacac_nation_title: "§T@HXA Zapotec, Mixtec, and Tlapanec People§!"
 huaxyacac_nation_desc: "The Aztecs of Tenochtitlan have taught surrounding people groups that warfare is just as common now as it was ages ago, and our people and their related kin groups have been at war with each other for what seems like an eternity. Whether they are Aztecs invading our land or Mayan people raiding our villages and towns, the Zapotec, Mixtec, and Tlapanec people have known little in the way of peace. But, perhaps there is hope at the end of this tunnel laden with blood and tears. If we can unite the various kin groups under one singular authority and reform the administration, we might just be able to see a new light."
 
 
 angevin_nation_title: "§T@ANV Reform the Angevin Empire§!"
 angevin_nation_desc: "Long has it been since Henry II of England reigned at the zenith of the Angevin Empire back in the 12th Century. He not only inherited land in the British Isles and Normandy, but also sought to conquer more French land once the marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine was secure. Sadly, his creation did not last, and soon enough the French unified and drove out the English. Perhaps, with a stronger and more robust nation ready to further our ambitions, we can pick up where Henry II left off and reform the Angevin Empire once our claims in the region are secure and France is no more."
 maghreb_nation_title: "§T@MGB Unite the People of the Maghreb§!"
 maghreb_nation_desc: "For so long the people of the Maghreb have been disunited, constantly at war with each other because of politics, religion, culture, or some other matter entirely. There must be something to unite the spread out people of the Maghreb into one formal nation that can withstand attacks from both Christians in the north and growing Levantine, Egyptian, and Turkish influence from the east. If the other states of the Maghreb cannot find the strength to bring peace and unity to the region, then we shall."
 russian_republic_nation_title: "§T@RRR Unite the People of Rus§!"
 russian_republic_nation_desc: "The work done by our ancestors was not in vein, was it? Establishing the foundations of a proud republic generations ago, but still the sword of republican liberty clashes against the blade of traditional monarchy, especially in the lands of the Rus. We must see to it that this age-old battle is won by the side that can secure the most rights for the Russian citizens; with the Veche Republic as a founding part of our people, we can ensure that we see this batlle through to the very end." 
 wokou_nation_title: "§T@WKU Formalize the Wokou Pirates§!"
 wokou_nation_desc: "For too long we have been suppressed by the likes of regional powers in China, Korea, and Japan. They seek to claim the waters for themselves, push us to the edge of society, and remove our influence from every facet of Asia in general, yet these ambitions are not yet realized in full. Through deception and ruthless tactics and sustained aggression in the face of bleak times, the Wokou are slowly rising in power. Formalizing them into something more than just a loose group of smugglers and renegade sailors is what is needed now."
 north_sea_empire_nation_title: "§T@NSE Restoration of North Sea Hegemony§!"
 north_sea_empire_nation_desc: "Long has it been since we have heard the name 'Danelaw' be used without laughs being heard shortly after; either laughs, or silent whispers of discontent. What was lost so long ago shortly after Cnut the Great, the Danelaw and also hegemony over the entirety of the North Sea, is what we strive to restore to this very day. The lands will not be easy to conquer nor will the English and Scandinavians bow to our flag with ease, but we can see that the ambition of Cnut the Great was one of greatness. We will stop at nothing to see the North Sea Empire revived."
 seven_council_fires_nation_title: "§T@SCF Formalize the Seven Council Fires§!"
 seven_council_fires_nation_desc: "The various people that have come together under our leadership, they speak a similar language and share similar customs but they lack the unity that the foreigners do. Those who brought us horses and gunpowder weapons can set an example for how we can formalize ourselves into a proper nation that transcends tribal politics; a nation that is led by councils of people in the form of a confederacy."
 tamil_nation_title: "§T@TMA Tamilakam, Homeland of the Tamils§!"
 tamil_nation_desc: "Chera, Chola, and Pandya. The three powers that once held sway over Southern India could rarely unify it and utilize the power within the region to its fullest extent. Petty conflicts and civil unrest brought the deaths of many great Tamil rulers and outside threats struck down what upward momentum empires from our lands had. Though threats are still around today and we are not yet safe from foreigners, we are managing to unite the region like in previous times. If we can sustain this pace and conclude a lasting peace in the future, we just might be able to form a united Tamil empire."
 nahua_nation_title: "§T@NUA Unification of the Nahuatl§!"
 nahua_nation_desc: "Much has changed since the ones from far off shores arrived in our lands seeking various riches, land, and people to exploit for their own well being. We have learned from them and taken it upon ourselves to reform many aspects of our society so that we are no longer at a distinct disadvantage. All that remains now is to formally unite the various people around us, from the Aztecs to the Tecos and from the Purepecha to the Mixtec, into one federation. United we will stand tall against our foes."
 ainu_nation_title: "§T@AIM @EZO Begin the Great Journey§!"
 ainu_nation_desc: "The Wajin (Japanese) to our south, they think of the Ainu as nothing more than hunters and gatherers that live in quiet solace... But they are wrong, very wrong. We have been biding our time, slowly cultivating our own domain and attempting to work out our own internal issues so that we can unite together and become something greater than any of our ancestors could ever dream of. Though the days of the Jomon and the Emishi are long gone, their memories and the Yukars they passed down are still with us today. We shall begin the great journey soon enough, and become something the likes of which the Wajin have never seen before."
 lusong_nation_title: "§T@PHI A Nation of Islanders§!"
 lusong_nation_desc: "Divided by tribal warfare and fueds between states along the lines of which faith is correct, the islands that we inhabit can be so much more than what they currently are! Uniting the islands under a single polity that follows Anito, Hinduism, Buddhism, or Islam is going to lead to a variety of different perspectives on how we should govern our people, but that should not hold us back from uniting into one cohesive state and fending off foreign invaders."
 council_of_three_fires_nation_title: "§T@CTF A Nation for the Anishinaabe§!"
 council_of_three_fires_nation_desc: "Scattered and disunited for generations, the Anishinaabe people are not as weak as some might seem. Our mutual alliance of kinship from ages ago (made between the Ojibwe, the Ottawa, and the Potawatomi people) is echoed in our halls and homes so that we never forget it, but with new threats and ideas on the horizon, there are a great many things that could put this bond of kinship to the test. Let us formalize and found a new political entity based on the old pact and united our homeland around the Great Lakes, and after that, we may look to reunite with all the scattered Anishinaabe people."
 tamoyo_nation_title: "§T@TMY Rally the Tupi People!§!"
 tamoyo_nation_desc: "So long have we been disunited, feuding with various small tribes and trying to keep ourselves from falling into decay... But times change faster than our elders and chiefs might think. We are facing new threats from a place entirely unknown to us; speakers of unknown tongues bringers of new, terrifying weapons we have never seen before, what could they plan to do with us and other Tupi people? Subjugation is the answer, and subjugation of our people seems to be all these foreigners seem to be set out for. Perhaps it is not too late though! Perhaps we can turn the tide against these abhorrent invaders and seek out a fiery salvation from what seems like certain death."
 austra_bavaria_nation_title: "§T@AUB Unite the Crowns of Austria and Bavaria§!"
 austra_bavaria_nation_desc: "The likes of the Protestant Reformation and the German Renaissance are bringing to light many new ideas and also several new feuds that both Austrians and Bavarians are trying to sort out. Staying true to Catholicism and refusing to bow to the harsh rhetoric of various other states in the Holy Roman Empire, it would seem that Austrians and Bavarians have a lot in common when it comes to politics and religion alone. Perhaps these similarities can be joined together into a firm union between the two crowns so that a bastion of Catholicism remains in the Holy Roman Empire whilst fighting for what is truly just inside the its borders."
 dongbu_nation_title: "§T@DOZ Dongbu Zhou, the Eastern State§!"
 dongbu_nation_desc: "The Middle Kingdom is disunited and fighting amongst itself like in previous centuries. It is almost cyclical with how politics in the Middle Kingdom works, but things are not as dark or as mundane as they seem. We have the potential to rise to power from the east and proclaim a new era of stability for all inside the Middle Kingdom, we just need to secure a stable base of power in the east first."
 nanfang_nation_title: "§T@NCH Nanfang Zhi Di, the Land of the South§!"
 nanfang_nation_desc: "The rise and fall of politics in the Middle Kingdom is nothing new to the people of in the south for we have been both victims of these struggles and usurpers of power in the past, though, we could never truly hold onto power for long and make a strong dynasty lead from the southern region. Technology and ideas have changed as of late, however, and these new innovations that have brought forth new ways of administrating the land, new methods of making money off of trade, and new tactics in warfare will help soldify ourselves as a strong and centralized southern power."
 xibu_nation_title: "§T@XBU Xibu Tudi, the Western Land§!"
 xibu_nation_desc: "There are strong memories and traditions that run through the lands of Chengdu and its surroundings, but all too often in the history of the Middle Kingdom the western region has been overshadowed by other parts of the Middle Kingdom. Now that politics in the Middle Kingdom are fractured once again, there is a chance for the western part of the Middle Kingdom to restore a sense of righteous order throughout the land, we need only to take our time to calculate our moves going forward to secure the heart at Chengdu."
 beichao_nation_title: "§T@BCH Beichao, the Northern Dynasty§!"
 beichao_nation_desc: "Laws to the people, people to examinations, meticulous administrative measures, and a righteous overseer for all of the northern lands; these are what will be our guiding principles as we set forth to unite the northern part of the Middle Kingdom. Yet, these words alone cannot give us the grand restoration of political order that we desire; the world is never so simple, is it? Our administration, as large as it may get, must work hand-in-hand with the military and the diplomatic sector to ensure that Beijing, Luoyang, and Xi'an remain the centers of power for all of the Middle Kingdom."
 zhongguo_nation_title: "§TReforge the Middle Kingdom§!"
 zhongguo_nation_desc: "Through the fires of war, tears of sorrow, and diplomatic deals at all levels, we stand at the edge of a new age. The Middle Kingdom has seen little in the way of strong leadership since the fall of the Ming Dynasty and few would call the warlords that rose in its wake anything but petty and weak, but we have risen above the chaos and carved out a thriving state in which several great minds and communities of Chinese people call home. Soon enough, it shall be time for us to pierce the veil of the next age and bring the Middle Kingdom to its peak, reforging it with new ideas from our greatest minds and also honoring the many traditions of its past."
 belgium_nation_title: "§T@BEL Form Belgium!§!"
 belgium_nation_desc: "The Dutch think so highly of themselves and the French pressure our people from the west and south, and still the Germanic people to our southeast encroach on our position in Europe. What are the Flemish and Walloon people supposed to do when they feel that no ther state around them treats them as an equal part of matters? Politics on both a communal level and a state level have continued to glaze over the fact that the Flemish and Walloon people toil away without end, but with new ideas spreading and political opportunities coming about, we need to seek an independent state for both people groups."
 ikko_nation_title: "§T@IKI At the Center of Ikko-Ikki§!"
 ikko_nation_desc: "We are vocal and staunch supporters of the Ikko-Ikki movement that has rocked the lands of various daimyo for more than a century now. They are a small and scattered movement with sporadic support by local officials, but we are one of the first to hear and embrace the the teachings of Jodo Shinshu taught at first by Shinran (1173-1263) and then by Rennyo (1415-1499). Now the time has come to fully cultivate a state around Jodo Shinshu and have the people who find refuge in the Ikko-Ikki uprisings come into our fold." 
 
 
 
 celtic_nation_title: "Tir na Celtigh, the Land of the Celts"
 celtic_nation_desc: "Separated by not only physical geography but also by ambitions, foreign states, and petty internal feuds, the Celtic people are but a husk of what they once were. Still though, there is a glimmer of hope in these dire times as there are some in the ranks of our own state and other Celtic states that see unification of our scattered people as a way to fight back effectively. Are these people right in their thinking? Is it possible to unite the scattered lands of the Celts into a single state? The only way we can find out is to forge ahead and do our best to beat back the opponents of the Celtic people."
 #apacheria_nation_title: "Apache Branches Summoned Forth"
 #apacheria_nation_desc: "Apache people have been migrating and shifting around these lands for ages, whether they were from Lipan, Mescalero, or other scattered Apache branches. Have we forgotten what made our people strong before the foreigners came to our land? Our bonds of kinship and our tenacity in battle, those are what hold several Apache communities together despite the changes that happen around them. The choice for us to formalize these bonds into something greater than what our ancestors were used to is something that will revolutionize how the Apache people see not only themselves, but the world at large too."
 #comancheria_nation_title: "The Great Plains Calling"
 #comancheria_nation_desc: "Ages have passed since we took it upon ourselves to separate away from the main branch of Shoshone people and we have proven ourselves worthy of maintaining our own independent and unique identity. Yet, foreigners from afar seek to encroach on what is traditionally our homeland and take hold of what should belong to the Comanche and those who swear loyalty to the Comanche. Let us not be subverted by their smug attitudes and great ambitions; let us use what ideas and technologies they bring to this land against them through building up a true nation that can govern these great plains despite these foreigners."
 #dinetah_nation_title: "The Diné Stand Together"
 #dinetah_nation_desc: "Connections that the Diné people have made with the Pueblo people are strong as they stretch across generations, but new ideas and technologies introduced by foreigners to these lands mean that many old bonds of kinship are not so safe anymore. The Diné need not hold these old bonds to the day we die, no, we must see to it that they evolve to something more formal as we grow ourselves. The Diné are carving out a state in these arid lands that can stand the test of time thanks to plundered and traded resources from foes from afar, but we must bring others to our way of thinking so that they can stand with us, together."
 #selis_qlispe_nation_title: "Selis and Qlispe People, Together!"
 #selis_qlispe_nation_desc: "For as long as we can remember, these rivers, forests, hills, and shores have been ours and have hosted not only our people, but the people of several other groups of people. Though times have changed and the foreigners from far off shores think of taking advantage of our disunity and lack of cohesion, they see not what we see. Where they see disunity amongst spread out people, we see opportunities to unite against a common foe. It is through this common ground that we can and will forge a nation that unites together the people of these lands; the Selis and Qlispe people will rise up and defend their land at all costs!"
 meghalaya_nation_title: "§T@MHY To the Clouds on High...§!"
 meghalaya_nation_desc: "This land of ours, dense with vegetation and rain... It has proven very hard to conquer for foreigners, yet time and time again we see states rise and fall around these dangerous and lucrative lands. If we can perhaps tame these lands through a more formalized administration and a stronger military, we might just be able to unite the scattered people into a single state that can halt the advance of the Bengal Sultanate and those around it. The journey to that goal will test the very fabric of our being... Are we ready to ascend into the clouds above?"
 tamazagha_nation_title: "§T@TMZ The Dream of the Berbers§!"
 tamazagha_nation_desc: "Whilst in the past we have held sway over vast stretches of land in the form of the Almoravid Dynasty and the Almohad Caliphate, they never did last long enough to cement our presence as a truly Berber state. The identity of these past states was more based on cultural mixing between Berbers, Arabs, and Andalusians under the common veil of Islam, but times have changed greatly since then. It is time that we cultivate a land that is unified by and for Berbers with Arabs and others at their side, transcending the tribal confederations of the past and the many other facets that kept Berbers disunited."
 #latin_empire_nation_title: "Rule of the Latins"
 #latin_empire_nation_desc: "If it was not for the work of Michael VIII and the ineffective leadership of the old Latin Empire in the mid-1200s, perhaps our legacy would have lasted longer. But as it stands, the Catholic crusader states of the Fourth Crusade are on their last legs what with Islamic advances across Anatolia, the Levant, and even into the Balkans. The Byzantines are clearly not worthy enough to hold back the rising tide of Muslims pushing westward; it is only the crusaders that have managed to push them back time and time again with only tangential aid from Byzantium. The time has come to end their decrepit empire and establish the Latin Empire once more, so that the Latins may restore order both religiously and politically."
 #haudenosaunee_nation_title: "Peace of the Longhouse"
 #haudenosaunee_nation_desc: "For generations now, we have seen countless feuds go back and forth in our land without end and we have struggled to maintain a cohesive and independent existence in these lands. Yet, growing bases of power both in the amount of people loyal to us and in the amount of political influence we hold are becoming vital in these struggles for power and authority; the Haudenosaunee people are very much eager to sort out which clan mothers and which moietys deserve the most prestige and power. Will we be the one to bring peace to these great clashes for ultimate authority? With dangers lurking just beyond our horizon, it is either life or death at this point."
 #illyrian_nation_title: "One to Rule them All!"
 #illyrian_nation_desc: "Subjugation by outside forces is nothing new to South Slavs as the Ottomans, the Hungarians, and those of the Holy Roman Empire have sought out dominance of the Balkans for generations now. Yet they cannot stamp out the great embers burning within the hearts of every South Slav around! Whether they are descendants of the great Serbian Empire, the noble Bulgarian Empires, the precariously placed Bosnian Kingdom, the contested Croatian Kingdom, the great League of Lezhe, or even the small Slovene communities to the north, there will be one who will rise up amongst the warring factions and unite the South Slavs into a single political entity."
 evenk_nation_title: "§T@EVK Evenk Nomads and Settlers, United§!"
 evenk_nation_desc: "We have lived in these lands for generations and have had regular contact with Jurchens and Mongols, but they have adapted to changing environments around them more than we have. Evenk people have kept to themselves for so many years that it seems like we will forever be here, but that does not have to be the case! If we can unify the Evenk people into a single state under a single governing body, perhaps we have a chance at breaking the mold of previous generations and cultivating something new for our future generations."
 koryak_nation_title: "§T@KCH Scattered Pieces in Siberia§!"
 koryak_nation_desc: "Very few have come into contact with us from the southern reaches. The rivers that go through dense, frigid forests whilst nature eats away at their will to press on, it makes it seem like there would be no one living in this almost completely frozen land to the far north. And yet, we have lived in these very forests and along these coasts and rivers for generations without end, hunting and herding as much as we can so that we can carve out a living. In time, we can move on from this and form more cohesive and prosperous villages and towns throughout these cold lands in the taiga and tundra, but it won't be easy nor come quickly. When we achieve this though, will the other Koryak people around us join our communities?"
 hetmanate_nation_title: "§T@HET Not Polish, Not Russian, but Ruthenian!§!"
 hetmanate_nation_desc: "The incursions of both the Poles and the Russians into our land has been the cause of several conflicts since the Ottomans from the south also seek our land in conjunction with Tatars from the east. Fields have burned, villages have been shattered, and entire upstart leaders have been slain in order to subjugate this land of Ruthenia for the likes of foreign states and leaders. Now, brothers and sisters, it is time that we put and end to the destruction brought to us by these enemies on all sides! Though we find solace and strength in our military potential, it does not mean we are devoid of independent ambition for all of Ruthenia!"
 
 
 
 carantania_nation_title: "§T@CTR Carantania's Faded Memory§!"
 carantania_nation_desc: "After Samo's Empire fell apart and before the March of Carinthia was established, there was Carantania. It was a Slavic polity that was under the influence of powerful outside forces like the Franks, the Bavarians, and the Avars, yet its memory in these lands have not been wiped away by the Austrians nor the Magyars. If we can strike down Austrian power before it becomes too much to deal with whilst ensuring our own diplomatic position in the region, we can carry on the legacy of Carantania as a polity where both Germanic and Slavic people intermingle on the frontier of both the Balkans and the Holy Roman Empire."
 polabia_nation_title: "§T@PBA The Edge of the Western Slavs§!"
 polabia_nation_desc: "Alongside the Czech people, the Polabian tribes were part of the frontier of Western Slavic settlements centuries ago. Yet, being disunited in the face of increasingly strong states in all directions led to the steady partition and subjugation of all Polabian tribes (even our own relatives in the form of the Poles helped strike Polabians down). But still, the memories from those previous centuries are still around as descendants of old Polabian tribes have stayed alive in small, isolated pockets of the Holy Roman Empire. Let us unite these scattered kin of ours into one formal nation, transcending past the old tribal bonds and feuds and cultivating a truly unique state that is at the border with the heart of the Germans."

 #occitania_nation_desc: "The French nobles and lords from Paris have tried to rein in the likes of Occitania for generations upon generations, but the region and its people have contiued to develop independently from the likes the north. The efforts of Philip II and his successors have been remarkable in dividing up our region and turning us into pawns of the French crown, but this cannot last forever! We must fight both in diplomacy and on the field of battle to gain our rightful place in Europe; we must carry on the works of the Counts of Toulouse and Catalonia and let all around us hear the beauty of Occitania!"

 #azarbaydjan_nation_desc: "This is the land of ancients, similar to Iranian land to our southeast. Both our homeland and the lands of the Sassanid and Parthian Empire are linked together in history and culture, yet we have remained unified for far less time in comparison. Our people still have records and memories of the days when this very land was called 'Land of the Holy Fire' and that very fire still burns brightly within the Azeri people, no matter where they are. We must throw off the burden set unto us by outside powers and unite these disparate lands together; no longer can we sustain ourselves as mere subjects or pawns in the wider game of international politics."

That nation of our future will be Maluku."

 campadesa_nation_desc: "There is much to be learned about the history of the Cham people as a whole, but all of it is on the verge of collapse due to outside forces taking advantage of our current struggles. Po Binasuor, the 'Red King' in the stories told by Viet people, was our last strong ruler and he showed just how strong the Cham people could be. Sacking and burning Hanoi on four separate occasions (once in 1371, twice in 1377, and once more in 1383) left the Viet people in a horrible state, but they rebounded whilst we declined well after Po Binasuor's death in 1390. That legacy of his lives on in us though; we can and will strive to live up to his deeds. We will carve out a sustainable state for the Cham people!"

 sudan_nation_desc: "The warring tribes and states of the region are not content with just fighting over old feuds and backroom deals, they are willing to fight over which religion has the primary right to preside over the entirety of the region. The time of Christian leaders of Nubian descent is at an end and we are seeing that happen before our very eyes; the power they once held during the time of the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates is fleeting. The time for Islam to encompass this land, the 'bilad as-sudan' or 'Land of the Blacks', is at hand, but which emir or vizier will lead the way?"

Through utilizing the power of electors of Rhenish descent and the use of the Palatinate to help stabilize our position in the Holy Roman Empire, we will be able to unite these lands into one single polity that can stand up to the likes of the would-be elden lords around us."

 kingdom_of_the_isles_nation_desc: "The gradual degradation of our authority from the death of Somerled in the mid-1100s onward meant that the once glorious yet contested Kingdom of the Isles was slowly brought into the fold of Scotland. By the time of Magnus Olafsson, the last Norse King of Mann, things were well and truly in the favor of the Scottish and we were set on a path of being a vassal state. There is weakness in the Scottish throne though, and if we can take advantage of their downfall somehow, we can assert our authority once more and retake what islands belong to us. Soon enough, the kingdom will rise up from the waters again!"

 thessaloniki_nation_desc: "Defeat after defeat inflicted upon Eastern Orthodox states by the Ottomans has resulted in where things are as of the mid-1400s. Byzantine glory is all but lost and the shattered pieces are trying to hold together what they can, but the physical legacy is as fragile as glass at this point. With what strength we have and what alliance networks we can garner, we must retake the lands of Byzantium from these foul invaders! The Orthodox communities left behind in the wake of their invasions will rise with us if given enough reason to, we just need to gain a foothold in this deathly shadow of a time period!"

 thessalonica_nation_desc: "The Fourth Crusade is but a faint memory in the minds of some, but the remnants of it live on by threads on the edge of a cliff in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. We see around us the Ottoman invasions dealing blow after blow against the likes of our fellow crusader states left behind from the 1200s, but all hope is not lost, not yet at least. Gather the troops and reach out to our brothers and sisters of faith throughout Europe, we can still beat back the Ottoman forces if given enough grit, discipline, and effort! The steps to Latin glory are gravely difficult but not impossible to manage!"

 vladimir_suzdal_nation_desc: "The Mongol Yoke put a great number of princes from the Rus to death, greatly diminishing the power of up-and-coming states that were forming after Kiev lost power in the 1100s. Despite the losses sustained during this time period, people of the Rus found refuge in the likes of Moscow which has now become the seat of oppressive and ruthless rulers that manipulate politics without care. Though the memories are faded, we can still resurrect the old power held within Vladimir and Suzdal and give life to a better alternative for the Russian people."
