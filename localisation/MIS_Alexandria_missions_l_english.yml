 ALX_Flavour_Events.2.d: "The sun was setting on the horizon as the army returned home, victorious. The long and grueling campaign to conquer the region was finally complete, and the soldiers marched through the gates of the city to the cheers of the waiting crowds.\n\nAs they made their way through the streets, the people threw flowers at their feet and celebrated their triumph. The generals and leaders of the army were greeted with the greatest adulation, as they had led their troops to victory against all odds.\n\nBut despite the celebrations, [Root.GetMonarch] knew that work was far from over. There were still new lands to be conquered, new battles to be fought, and new enemies to be defeated."
