 #Events:
 ME_Armenia_Event.EVTNAME1: "East Byzantium"
 ME_Armenia_Event.EVTDESC1: "For almost 10 centuries Armenia was part of Roman Empire. First as a client state, then later one as a theme when the empire split in two and west Rome fell to Barbarians. While the nature of our relationship was not benevolent at first, as we simply picked them over Persians, two warring empires who wanted our kingdom to be their buffer state, it grew to become much more. Armenia was the first nation to accept Christianity as official religion and Rome followed not long after. This brought our nations closer and closer as time went by. We became Edge of Rome, its first defense against invading heathens. Knowing there was no future without protection of being part of Roman Empire, and he Romans realizing the value of or people in defending their borders, the relationship between our people grew even further.This relationship got to its peak when a member of our royal dynasty of Lekapenos was elected to the position of Emperor of Byzantine Empire.\n\nNow with Lekapenos family returning from exile, and Roman Empire gone, we can attempt to restore it not for the prestige of it alone, but avenge the fall a christian bastion for the people in the area and completely dismiss the pretension of invading Turks that they are Rome, or 'Rûm' they would call it. Byzantine identity is as much part of our identity as we are part of it and we cannot afford to be selfish when our Christian brothers continue suffering. We must recreate a Christian bastion for all Christians in the east, with us on the helm of such entity and there is nothing more glorious than restoration of Roman Empire.\n\nFor Armenia! For Rome! For Christendom!"
 ME_Armenia_Event1.EVTOPT1: "Glory to Lekapenos!"
 
 ME_Armenia_Event.EVTNAME2: "Question of Religion"
 ME_Armenia_Event.EVTDESC2: "On our glorious path to restore Byzantium, we face the dilemma of having to change our state religion to Orthodoxy. Not only part of our people are already Orthodox it would also increase the magnitude of our claim, but if we decide against it, we can still proceed as our military might and tolerance of all Christians cannot be questioned. Either way this is merely a decision of prestige and legitimacy as Armenia prides itself to be a country for all Christians, not a single denomination of it."
 ME_Armenia_Event2.EVTOPT1: "Legitimacy before traditions."
 ME_Armenia_Event2.EVTOPT2: "Our traditions shall not be abandoned."
