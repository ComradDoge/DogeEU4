 # Events:
 ME_Uesugi_Events.EVTNAME2: "An Honorable Lord?"
 ME_Uesugi_Events.EVTDESC2: "The offspring of a notable warrior, Kenshin was originally named Nagao Kagetora. Having changed the name to Uesugi Kenshin right after the adoption into the Uesugi clan. Known for possessing a tremendous sense of honor, Kenshin was one of the most powerful Daimyos of the Sengoku period. While chiefly remembered for displaying extraordinary battlefield prowess, Kenshin is also regarded as an extremely skillful administrator who fostered the growth of local industries and trade; indeed the period under Kenshin's rule saw a marked rise in the standard of living of Echigo. \n\nEloquently dubbed 'God of War', Kenshin was famed for never-before-seen military expertise and a unshaken belief to the Buddhist God of war to the point where the Daimyo's followers believed their Lord to be the personification of war itself. So fearsome was Kenshin's rivalry with Takeda Shingen (dubbed 'Tiger of Kai') that many historians commemorated the clashes as drawings showing a Dragon wrestling with a Tiger. \n\nLastly, the tremendous revelation that Kenshin was actually a woman, came from the letter of a Spanish explorer, detailing how Kenshin planned her campaigns around her menstrual cycle."
