 dse_flavour_usa.t: "A Different Name?"
 dse_flavour_usa.d: "Proposal to the American literati, and to all the citizens of the United States, to employ the following names and epithets for the country  and nation to which they belong; which, at the distance of 27 years from the declaration and of 20 years from the acknowledgment of their independence, are to  this day destitute of proper geographical and political denominations, whereby they may be aptly distinguished from the other regions and peoples of the  earth:\n\nFredon, the aggregate noun for the whole territory of the United States.\nFredonia, a noun of same import, for rhetorical and poetical use.\nFredonian, a sonorous name for 'a citizen of the United States'.\nFrede, a short and colloquial name for 'a citizen of the United States'.\nFredish, an adjective to denote the relations and concerns of the United States.\n\nExample. Fredon is probably better supplied with the materials of her own history than Britain, France, or any country in the world, and the reason is obvious, for the attention of the Fredonians was much sooner directed, after their settlement, to the collection and preservations of their facts and records than that of the Dutch and Irish. Hence it will happen that the events of Fredish history will be more minutely known and  better understood than those of Russian, Turkish, or Arabic. And thereby the time will be noted carefully when a native of this land, on being asked who he is and  whence he came, began to answer in one word that he is a Frede, instead of using the tedious circumlocution that he was "a citizen of the United States of America." And in the like manner notice will be taken of the association of Fredonia and Macedonia and Caledonia as a word equally potent and melodious in sound."
