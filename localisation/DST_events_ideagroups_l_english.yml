 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.1.t: "Attack on Civil Rights"

 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.2.t: "Independent Jurisdiction"
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.2.d: "Judges have grown bold and rather independent from the rest of the state. They  They have frequently challenged the authority of the state in some cases and ignored others. Perhaps that is good?"

 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.4.t: "Law Education"

 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.5.t: "Fabrications Found"
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.5.d: "Papers, gone. The important ones. The VERY important ones. The ones that were used in fabricating our claims! Why did we not burn them?

 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.6.t: "Bureaucratic Nightmare"
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.6.d: "The current situation at all levels of court can only be compared to the Romans in the east and their insane bureaucracy. Stacks upon stacks of paper have piled up and need to be checked and sorted. How did this even come about? Who knows. What we know, however, is that this is delaying important matters. This needs to be sorted out as fast as possible."
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.6.o1: "It will take some time."

 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.8.t: "Bribed Judge"
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.8.d: "A judge has been accused and has been found to be bribed in multitude of court cases. A further investigation will have to be made in how much money and by whom was given to the judge. In the mean time, this will hurt the reputation of the judicial system."
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.8.o1: "Get rid of the judge." 

 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.9.t: "Reactionary Tendencies"
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.9.d: "Uneasy times! People discuss the value and necessity of their civil rights and shockingly many of them seem willing to give up on them and instead demand strong leadership leading them into the future."
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.9.o1: "I'll show them strong leadership, all right." 
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.9.o2: "The sheep herd themselves these days."

 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.10.t: "Judicial Scandal"
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.10.d: "Our Minister of Justice has uncovered a corrupt network in our jurisdiction. Judges, helpers and administrators were bribed and have gained great influence over the processes in our administration. As things are working pretty well still at the surface we need to decide if we want to enact drastic measures or leave it be for the moment."
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.10.o1: "Time to clean house." 
 dse_events_ideagroups_judiciary.10.o2: "Really? Oh well."

 dse_events_ideagroups_development.6.d: "All raw material that is required for production, construction or anything in between is more than enough! Allowing us to not lose time and keep focusing on the task at hand!"

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.1.t: "Unreasonable Quotas"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.1.d: "Things have gotten so ridiculous that even basic quotas can’t be reached in a timely manner. It is difficult to find who is responsible, but for now, we should reassess the way we made our quotas so that they are more realistic moving forward."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.1.o1: "Perhaps we have been too eager…"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.1.o2: "Out of touch? No, It is the workers who are at fault! Work Harder!"

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.2.t: "We are the state!"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.2.d: "While some believe the state is but one person, the truth is that it is a big tapestry woven by the hands of a myriad of little workers, from the cooks to the magistrates and all in-between! Our people know that they work towards the betterment of all by accomplishing their daily task."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.2.o1: "And we are proud of it!"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.2.o2: "Reap the benefits."

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.3.t: "Pushback from all sides"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.3.d: "Despite our best efforts, it appears that many things simply refuse to change. While we try to advocate for the legalisation of society as a whole for the sake of efficiency, many people fall outside the purview of our government or simply… do not like what we are doing. Tax collectors, administrators and magistrates have reported attacks and dissent among the populace."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.3.o1: "Take a step back and compromise."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.3.o2: "Crush them! No one shall oppose us!"
 
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.4.t: "Deeply Rooted Nepotism"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.4.d: "Nepotism is about as old as civil society itself. While we understand that placing friends and family in positions of power or work is preferable to many, it is slowing down our efforts in creating a more meritocratic government. Then again, we could use it to our advantage."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.4.o1: "Comb through records then replace those undeserving of their position."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.4.o2: "Use their connections."

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.5.t: "The people look up to us!"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.5.d: "Our efforts to squash excessive bureaucracy and instituting fairer practices at every echelon of society gives people hope that the next day will be better than the one before!"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.5.o1: "For a better tomorrow!"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.5.o2: "Direct our energy towards new developments."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.5.o3: "Slow and steady."

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.6.t: "Excessive Construction"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.6.d: "New offices, bureaus, buildings, cafeterias, guilds and even offices for a guild bureau building! This over-saturation of construction to support our administrative efforts has led to a lot of confusion, redundancy and worse of all, budgetary issues. Meanwhile the sites where we get our materials from are becoming empty."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.6.o1: "Nothing will stand in our way!"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.6.o2: "Destroy it all! Leave no stone standing and start over!"

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.7.t: "Magistrate abuse their position"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.7.d: "We have received complaints from our subjects regarding several of the newly appointed representatives of the state, especially in some of the more far-flung regions of our realm. Whether it be incompetence, malice or complacency, they are not performing as well as they should."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.7.o1: "They have forfeited their office!"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.7.o2: "Reprimand them but don’t do more."

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.8.t: "Stagnation"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.8.d: "At the moment our officials seem to be running out of ideas on how to increase productivity or performance. Some fear that routine work will be the end of them, killing their motivation."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.8.o1: "Not ideal"

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.9.t: "Standardisation of Processes"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.9.d: "The same stamp on every document from one region to the other, the same insignia to recognise government workers, similar pay for the same jobs, the same requirements for our soldiers… it does make things easier."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.9.o1: "The right tool for the right job… and the right people!"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.9.o2: "Restoration and renovation is on the menu."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.9.o3: "Issue reforms for the military."

 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.10.t: "Confusing Reforms"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.10.d: "Article 17.2b states that those categorised in quadrant 2 section F as benefiting from case-file ‘MCMLXXXIV’ issued by our Magistrature during the temporary conference on Interest party five section 3.7 article a. should receive compensation. It seems that the law can be a bit obscure to the common folk."
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.10.o1: "…what?"
 dse_events_ideagroups_stateaffairs.10.o2: "This is confusing."
