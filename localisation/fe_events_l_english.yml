 FE_Ainu_Events.1.a: "The Paths Ahead"
 FE_Ainu_Events.1.b: "The Wajin (Japanese) have pushed back the Jomon people and their descendants for centuries without end. The Yamato Period saw the Wajin make violent strides against the Emishi people in the north until finally, all that was left were the culmination of various tribal people in the northern island, the island of the Ainu. Now that things have changed though, and military authority and power in Wajin land are waning, the Ainu people are becoming more emboldened and organized. Taking in teachings and reforms that the Wajin have instituted over the ages is hard on the Ainu people, but there is a common understanding now amongst Ainu people that the time is right to strike into the heart of Japan and bring about a new for the Ainu people. The question remains though, what path should the Ainu pursue above all others?"
 FE_Ainu_Events.1.c: "There is wisdom in the Wajin way of governing."
 FE_Ainu_Events.1.d: "We will learn and improve upon the Wajin ways."
 
 
 #Chinese Events
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.a: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.b: "The fall of the Ming Dynasty was a harsh blow to the various people groups that consider themselves Chinese and also other people groups who called the lands of the Ming Dynasty home. Stability and prosperity were shattered like glass being hit with lead shot, causing widespread chaos across the land. From Guangzhou to Chengdu, and from Nanjing to Beijing, no place seemed safe from the warfare that involved new ways of fighting with cannons and muskets. Thankfully, this period of struggle and torment is over, and the true Son of Heaven, our grand leader, is shaping the Middle Kingdom toward a bright and glorious future. Even at this rise to our apex of power, we must not forget our traditions that have brought us to this point. The past dynasties all the way back to the fabeled Xia Dynasty to the righteous Han Dynasty and beyond, all have a proper place in our archives as they rightfully should but many scholars of ours propose that we take after one of these previous states in our distant past. Perhaps if we study upon a particular dynasty or state hard enough and devote enough attention to uncovering past truths about them, we can pick up a few key facets of what made them great and refine them for our own purposes in this more modern era."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.c: "The Xia may be shrouded in myth, but they are also shrouded in wisdom."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.d: "As the Shang were devoted to faith and jurisprudence, so to are we."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.e: "To succeed the Han is to succeed in every aspect of statecraft."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.f: "The Liao's blend of two lifestyles is a grand ideal for all of us."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.g: "The splendor of the Song will be revived with respect and honor."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.h: "We will learn from and the Sui and do what it could not."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.i: "The Northern Wei's will to sinicize and adopt Buddhism will be our model."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.j: "Fragmented Zhao history can become whole through our authority."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.k: "Obscured Liu Song memories should be brought to light and refined by us."
