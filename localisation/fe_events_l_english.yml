 #Ainu Events
 FE_Ainu_Events.1.a: "The Paths Ahead"
 FE_Ainu_Events.1.b: "The Wajin (Japanese) have pushed back the Jomon people and their descendants for centuries without end. The Yamato Period saw the Wajin make violent strides against the Emishi people in the north until finally, all that was left were the culmination of various tribal people in the northern island, the island of the Ainu. Now that things have changed though, and military authority and power in Wajin land are waning, the Ainu people are becoming more emboldened and organized. Taking in teachings and reforms that the Wajin have instituted over the ages is hard on the Ainu people, but there is a common understanding now amongst Ainu people that the time is right to strike into the heart of Japan and bring about a new for the Ainu people. The question remains though, what path should the Ainu pursue above all others?"
 FE_Ainu_Events.1.c: "There is wisdom in the Wajin way of governing."
 FE_Ainu_Events.1.d: "We will learn and improve upon the Wajin ways."

 
 #Tamazagha Events
 FE_Tamaz_Events.1.a: "Revitalized, Resurgent, Resplendent"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.1.b: "Amazigh people have never been as united as they are right now at this moment. Even during the times of the Almoravid Dynasty or the Almohad Caliphate that were of Amazigh origin, there was disunity in the far reaches of both states to the point that controlling far stretches of land whilst wrestling over dynastic politics was nearly impossible. Yet we have proven ourselves worthy to succeed these old legacies and we have carved out a firm place in history with the renovation of three principle mosques in North Africa: The Kutubiyya Mosque in Marrakech, the Great Mosque of Tlemcen, and the Kasbah Mosque in Tunis.\nOur efforts to build up these great mosques of the north has meant that the people of the land realize just how dedicated we are to preserving the memories of the past whilst fighting against foreign invaders that might come through from Iberia or other parts of the Mediterranean Sea. With this in mind, it is no wonder why we are seeing a growth in both religious and communal fervor across the northern parts of Tamazgha. The question now is where we should focus our attention to get the most out of this fervor: religion? Politics? Militarism even?"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.1.c: "The Ulema know how best to use our resources!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.1.d: "Sufi Orders in Tamazgha will inspire our people!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.1.e: "Our other temples and workshops could use some renovations!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.1.f: "Our patronage will be paid for through military service!"
 
 FE_Tamaz_Events.2.a: "Stances on the Sahara and Sahel"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.2.b: "Our control of the Sahara is now nearly complete as the trade routes going across its vast sand dunes and various oases are under our control. The Tuareg cousins of ours now bow to our banners instead of paying fealty to petty imams or emirs outside of our state; it is with their backing across the Sahel that will help bolster our defenses and governing authority. Still there is work to be done in cities like Timbuktu, Gao, and Assode since they are recovering from the wars we have conducted in order to wrest control over the Sahel.\nOur military being the spearhead that brought us across the Sahara in the first place, they are wanting us to establish more fortifications, regimental camps, and recruitment stations in the Sahel so that they can bolster their own ranks. Whilst this can be good for a short while, it could grant the military too much power in the long term.\nIn Timbuktu, Gao, and Agadez, there are merchants and theologians there are petitioning our government to bring about more markets and souqs all across the lands of the Sahel. In doing so, they propose that trade caravans will be bolstered in how much profit they bring in and theological insights will be gained over time, but could this simply be a ploy by the merchants and ulema to garner more unwarranted power?\nImmigrants from the Sahel are moving from place to place and this includes former officials from the old Songhai Empire and the old Agadez Sultanate. Hearing their cries for representation in a more localized sense within Tamazgha is intriguing but it could also hamper our efforts to maintain a strong presence across the Sahara.\nLastly, we have our own officials within Tamazgha that view the Sahel as more of a 'passion project' that deserves more tender love and attention. Meticulous as this work will be, our own officials propose a temporary diversion of resources southward to develop the Sahel into a true bastion for Tamzagha power.\nWhich proposal sounds the wisest?"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.2.c: "Our military can manage the Sahel perfectly fine!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.2.d: "The Merchants and Ulema have our best interests in mind!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.2.e: "We could and should definitely use Songhai and Agadez officials!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.2.f: "Reconstruct the Sahel in the image of Tamazgha!"
 
 FE_Tamaz_Events.3.a: "Monumental Political Shifts"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.3.b: "The conquests of Tamazgha have been costly to a great many people, yet they have born the fruit that we so dealy cherish to this day. Our control over the Niger River and the trade routes going from north to south in West Africa has yielded immense amounts of money and influence, the latter of which is hard for even the most isolated tribal people in West Africa to stay away from.\nOur fights against the Mossi people have been some of the most brutal at times as they have proven difficult to handle when it comes warfare, raiding, and attempting to integrate land annexed from the Mossi people themselves. If the Mossi people can put up such a stiff resistance and drain Tamazgha of vital resources needed for other areas, perhaps we should look into doing something different.\nIncreasingly we are hearing calls from our administration in the Sahel to cooperate with the Mossi people in a decentralized manner; a Mossi subject state loyal to Tamazgha but with its own rights to govern over places include the Volta River and nearby tribal areas.\nThere are others though that would prefer to break down these notions of an indepenent Mossi, Kong, or Dagbon state altogether and assimilate their cultures slowly into a sort of West African melting pot.\nAnother vocal portion of our administration opts for the opposite approach, seeking more righteous Tamazgha authority through strict organization of the land itself. A decentralized approach, as one would expect, is completely abhorrent to them.\nThe final section we are hearing from is the religiously bound of Tamazgha. Pious imams and muftis want to convert the lands of the Mossi and others beyond the Niger River, but know they can only do so with the protection of Tamazgha soldiers and government resources. They say this will save more lives and bring Islam to a wider audience, but do they have the best interests of the state in mind? Do any of these four factions want what is best for Tamazgha?"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.3.c: "Tamazgha houses many cultures already, it can house more!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.3.d: "Places untouched by the light of Islam, let them see salvation!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.3.e: "Let the Amazigh show these people true law and order!"
 FE_Tamaz_Events.3.f: "The Mossi have proven themselves worthy to us!"

 #Tir na Celtigh Events
 FE_Celtigh_Events.1.a: "Sharpen the Green Edge"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.1.b: "Times are changing all throughout Tir na Celtigh, are they not? Gone are the day of heavy cavalry charges with warriors clad in plate armor; the idea of being able to knock out the enemy from a distance through gunpowder weapons is here to stay. In slowly embracing the new age of warfare and doing away with feudal systems for our own military, we are faced with three schools of thought from our own courtiers and officials.\nSeparating our military by culture and language would give our regiments an easier time communicating with each other but it would necessitate granting some concessions across the board in terms of taxation and trade. The costs may be worth it though as we would more easily get recruits from each respective culture over time.\nFocusing in on a well disciplined and smaller military could outdo several enemy armies, but it would require us to pay them at higher wages as they train and stand guard. A simple cost-benefit calculation on paper to think about, really.\nTrying to be flexible with the regiments and funding some professional developments but not all would entail us gaining some quality over time, but it would also mean we have to turn away some would-be recruits who are crippled, too old, or too young.\nThen again... We don't really have to listen to any of these three schools of thought if we do not want to. We can let things develop naturally and have the blade of the Tir na Celtigh be formed by what it experiences both internally and externally. The choice, at the end of the day, is up the administration."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.1.c: "Let all see the color of the glorious banners!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.1.d: "Through books and training we will seize victory!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.1.e: "Moderate limits and modest payments are what we need!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.1.f: "We need not direct things so strictly."
 
 FE_Celtigh_Events.2.a: "By Steel? By Gunpowder?"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.2.b: "Without a doubt, the clans of Alba house some of the greatest fighters we could ever ask for. Being from such a region where manual labor is more intensive and living off the land is harder in general, it should come as no surprise that we have had more than our fair share of incidents regarding how to organize the clan recruits into proper regiments. Mercenary companies are plentiful from individual clans and those that they ally with, but bringing those into the proper military fold is something much harder to do as differences in tactical and strategic thinking divide a great portion of them.\nSome want to continue on the glory days of old through bold charges in battle with new and improved metal armor; whether or not they have a musket to back up their hunks of sharpened steel is of little consequence. To these rough-and-ready warriors, they live for and die on the field of battle.\nThere is the flip side to this, however, as those who embrace gunpowder weapons and actually value cultivating a life outside of battle are seeking to form a new 'hunters division' in our military. The calls to war are inevitable, as many of them tell us, but if they can pick off the enemy from afar and spare themselves an injury or two, then they will be able to continue serving without incident.\nThe floor is ours to take now; do we want to have a bold core of steel-clad warriors or is there wisdom in what the hunters say? Maybe there is a middle ground even?"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.2.c: "Let me hear your battle cry!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.2.d: "Hunt the enemy with muskets, not swords and spears!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.2.e: "Just bring them in for training; they can use what they want!"

 FE_Celtigh_Events.3.a: "Dawn of a New Day"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.3.b: "From the lands of the Highlanders to the lands of the Welsh and everywhere else, we have seen religion be at the crux of new feuds and conflicts. Whilst not every single community has had conflicts about whether they are Protestants, Catholics, Calvinists, Lutherans, Baptists, or some other form of Christian, a significant majority of our towns and cities have experienced unrest due to the clergy and nobility converting or standing their ground and refusing to convert.\nIt is because of these disputes that have spilled both blood and tears alike that we are brought to where we are now. With the religious landscape slowly settling back down into a more stable state across the lands of the Celtic people, we must put forward an edict of some kind that our people can abide by. It may not be a permanent edict and we do not have the zealots that were around during the start of the Protestant Reformation, but we can still make a move toward finding some sort of religious satisfaction in one sense or another. Tolerance? Conversions? Pragmatism even?"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.3.c: "There must be no heresy within our lands."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.3.d: "Religion matters not, so long as our laws are heeded."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.3.e: "All things can be reconciled if we work together."

 FE_Celtigh_Events.4.a: "Possibilities for Mannin"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.4.b: "Our investments into the Mannin and its people have yielded immense results so far what with traders, sailors, and even wealthy individuals seeing it as a fine place to travel to for a variety of reasons. Trade is bustling throughout the island, fortifications ensure it is safe from foreign incursions, and effective laws by our administration have stoked a sense of security amongst the people of Mannin.\nThere are those that think we could go further though, especially since we have established a proper center of learning on the island itself. These thinkers of Mannin are petitioning us to invest in new industries on the island itself so that it can be known for producing more than just high quality fish. Then again there are some intellectuals that refuse these notions and think that the fishing industry should not be infringed upon as it is a stable and traditional line of work for most Manninee.\nSome Manninee in the other camp tell us that a plethora of weavers and their associated tools could turn the island into a place where high quality clothing is produced, especially for the military and navy.\nA third group argue that producing things like rope, linen, sails, and tar for ships is the clear next step for the island in the heart of the Isles since it would make Mannin into a naval base of sorts that very few enemy fleets could break into.\nSome of the more well-spoken individuals have petitioned us to invest in paper making across the island so that it can become both an educational center and a provider of books, tomes, and manuscripts to more than just the Isles.\nThe final notable group of individuals have taken a liking to Venetian-made glass. They think that with enough investments and time, a valuable glass-making industry could be fostered on the island that provides uniquely Celtic-styled glass that is unlike anything Europe has yet seen.\nWhat is our choice on this matter?"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.4.c: "Risking our fishers is risking our very livelihood!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.4.d: "Better quality clothing? I like the sound of that!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.4.e: "More naval supplies is never a bad investment!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.4.f: "Make sure we do not start printing slander and lies..."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.4.g: "Celtic-style glass sounds profitable and beautiful!"

 FE_Celtigh_Events.5.a: "Aristocrats, Merchants, Shepherds"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.5.b: "Just as we are seeing a steady rise in the population of Cymru, we are seeing the growth of various professions that contribute to the overall economic state of Cymru and its people. From wealthy families gaining more influence and money, to merchants and guilds garnering more resources for their crafts, to the peasantry that tend to farms and herds beyond the reach of slowly urbanizing towns; all of them are becoming more substantial in how they impact the overall balance of power and influence.\nAs we gain more concrete data one what jobs are being created or dissolved, what resources are in demand and falling out of use, and what families both large and small are needing in terms of tangible materials so they can thrive, we should look into directing the growth of Cymru's communities both large and small. It would certainly take some time to recover from direct and stern actions and some people may protest such decisions, but if we see that there are holes in the economy of Cymru that need to be filled, now might be the best time to shift things around before the towns turn into thriving cities that are harder to assert full control over."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.5.c: "The wealthiest families are economic keys!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.5.d: "Merchants and guilds are the life of Cymru!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.5.e: "Without wheat or wool, all of Cymru is lost!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.5.f: "Let's keep our hands out of this for now."

 FE_Celtigh_Events.6.a: "The Status of the English People"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.6.b: "Ever since the English fell from power thanks to our state rising to prominence and taking over the entire region, the English people themselves have been at the mercy of our administration. Some English towns and cities greatly resent us for destroying the old English crown; some are indifferent to us and only care for sustaining their kin; there are also a select few groups that greatly endorse our authority over the lands of the English, but they are a rare lot to here about.\nNow that our survey of the English communities is coming to a close though, we can put forth a coherent court decision on how to deal with the English people as a whole.\nA fair portion of our administration sees the English as good peasants and tax collectors, but that's solely it; giving any sort of authority to an English person is abhorrent in their minds.\nThe militarily and naval minded folks of our court are understandably wanting support for their own sides in this matter and thus think that the English people would make for either great officers or admirals.\nThe fourth group in our court sees the English as integral to the nation at large and refuses to let the English be kept out of positions of power; in their eyes, time can heal all wounds as well as help make a more cooperative tomorrow.\nThe final group who are scarce in number but vocal in their stance seek out the most destructive option. They staunchly abhor having the English around at all, in any section of land in our nation; they want full-scale reprisals for the damage done to not only to the Cymry, but also to any other Celtic people harmed by the English in the past. Siding with them would surely bring about a large bout of unrest and tension..."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.6.c: "Coin and bread, that's all they're good for..."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.6.d: "Cannons and muskets will be their mainstay!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.6.e: "Ships and trade will be their mainstay!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.6.f: "To forgive; to stand united; to be one nation!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.6.g: "Wash the English from the Earth!"

 FE_Celtigh_Events.7.a: "Taking a Stance on Archery"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.7.b: "We would never deny the tradition of archery with longbows in particular that is key to what makes the Cymry stand out, would we? It helps cultivate strength in the upper body, self-control when learning to aim, and also coordination due to the multiple aspects that go into using a longbow efficiently and effectively. There is no denying, however, the effectiveness of gunpowder weapons and even the crossbow with regards to training time and ease of use; a crossbow or a musket can be used by nearly any able-bodied man or woman and they do not need extensive training when compared to the longbow.\nThe question then becomes, should we institute archery in general as a law or series of laws that requires peasants to practice regularly? Or should we leave the matter entirely and not try to keep archery as a mainstay for sports and hunting? Even if we do leave the matter open to the public at large, we can have confidence that there will be some communities of dedicated archers that will carry forth the tradition of the longbow well into the future. We may simply see that their numbers remain small and the recruits we take in for the military are of a lower quality due to rarely practicing archery at all."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.7.c: "A tradition like this will never die out!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.7.d: "We should encourage archery practice through tournaments!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.7.e: "Them wanting to learn archery or not is really none of my business..."

 FE_Celtigh_Events.8.a: "The Fate of Paris"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.8.b: "Since the establishment of the Franks in the region as a leading power during the times of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, Paris has served as the epicenter of Frankish authority for several generations. Only on a few times since the times of the Carolingian Empire has Paris been threatened by outside forces, yet the Celtic people have succeeded where others have failed and forced the French monarchy to concede the finest jewel in their proverbial crown.\nControlling the very heart of French power gives us a variety of options going forth, but the issue at hand right now is how we want to proceed with our control of the city itself. Nobles and royals alike that stayed behind and that are now under our authority are understandably worried about what we may do to Paris. Is it going to be looted to no end? Or maybe we will be merciful to the people of Paris and stop any looting?"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.8.c: "Seize its finest jewels, art, and resources with haste!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.8.d: "Taking a fair few precious pieces will be enough for us."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.8.e: "Why loot when we can use the city as a new base of power?"

 FE_Celtigh_Events.9.a: "For the Few; For the Many"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.9.b: "The fall of the French crown from grace has signaled a large shift in the politics of the region. No longer are there reputable French soldiers of high esteem and noble blood to take to the field of battle like they did in the 1300s and 1400s, but rather there are fearsome and righteous Celtic fighters that have already proven themselves in the heat of battle and when on long campaigns. Replacing the French in this military capacity is by no means easy as a reputation needs to be built over time, but since our nation is structured in different ways when compared to the ruinous French monarchy, we can have a hand in directing how our military reputation is built up over time. Being that the campaigns throughout the region have had Bretoned leadership at its forefront, we should be taking their voices into account more so than others.\nWe could establish a more open and caring reputation over time by opening the arms of the military to any and all recruits, specifically the infantry sector due to it requiring the least amount of training when compared to artillery or cavalry. If we opt for this, however, we open our ranks up to a decrease in overall quality since there are more people to train and fewer officers and commanders leading the way.\nSome have suggested that we focus on those already recruited instead and refine the training they already go through via military theories, war games, mock skirmishes, and regular target practice. We would be leaving a plethora of potential recruits out in the fields, but it would help ensure our forces are ready whenever they are needed.\nThe wealthy Bretoned families are putting their own cards on the table too since, as chance would have it, they feel that they should be in a leading position within the military. They do have the money to afford a proper education and high quality resources for whatever they do, but focusing on them would also mean focusing less on the lower echelons of our military and the overall intake of recruits.\nThe choice is ours to make, unless, we would rather focus on something else tangentially related to the infantry sector..."
 FE_Celtigh_Events.9.c: "Any and all Bretoned are welcome to pick up a musket!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.9.d: "Our current soldiers needs to be at least somewhat competent!"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.9.e: "Quality over quantity, is that not the saying?"
 FE_Celtigh_Events.9.f: "I think we need to make sure they have the supplies first..."


 #Chinese Events
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.a: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.b: "The fall of the Ming Dynasty was a harsh blow to the various people groups that consider themselves Chinese and also other people groups who called the lands of the Ming Dynasty home. Stability and prosperity were shattered like glass being hit with lead shot, causing widespread chaos across the land. From Guangzhou to Chengdu, and from Nanjing to Beijing, no place seemed safe from the warfare that involved new ways of fighting with cannons and muskets. Thankfully, this period of struggle and torment is over, and the true Son of Heaven, our grand leader, is shaping the Middle Kingdom toward a bright and glorious future. Even at this rise to our apex of power, we must not forget our traditions that have brought us to this point. The past dynasties all the way back to the fabeled Xia Dynasty to the righteous Han Dynasty and beyond, all have a proper place in our archives as they rightfully should but many scholars of ours propose that we take after one of these previous states in our distant past. Perhaps if we study upon a particular dynasty or state hard enough and devote enough attention to uncovering past truths about them, we can pick up a few key facets of what made them great and refine them for our own purposes in this more modern era."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.c: "The Xia may be shrouded in myth, but they are also shrouded in wisdom."
 FE_Zhongguo_Events.1.d: "As the Shang were devoted to faith and jurisprudence, so to are we."

 #Vladimir-Suzdal Events
 FE_vls_Events.1.a: "Healing from Open Wounds"
 FE_vls_Events.1.b: "Our greatness is unmatched in the entire Rus, is it not? We have achieved what few scribes, theologians, and commanders ever thought was possible once the tide of Mongols began to shrink: defeating Muscovy in its entirety! No longer will any leader from Moscow wield so much unchecked power with the boyars at their heel; no longer will the religious and political heads of the Rus look toward Moscow for answers and laws. The legacy of Yuri Dolgorukiy, the first appointed Rurikid prince of Rostov, can be said to have been fulfilled to some degree.\nAnd yet, we find ourselves still sifting through potential decrees and laws for the newly annexed Muscovite land, particularly with regards to the capital of our former rival. A variety of people in Vladimir-Suzdal are petitioning for Moscow to have different fates ranging from absolute desolation to simply leaving the city alone as it is.\nDo we really have the heart to shed more blood and show off to all other people of the Rus that Muscovy is well and truly dead? Or are we as an administration simply focusing on envy and callousness too much?"
 FE_vls_Events.1.c: "Moscow will be a simple hamlet and field at the end!"
 FE_vls_Events.1.d: "Take all the valuables to where they truly belong, our capital!"
 FE_vls_Events.1.e: "Forced into military labor sounds fitting for Muscovites."
 FE_vls_Events.1.f: "We will not be forced to shed even more blood inside the Rus."

 FE_vls_Events.2.a: "Amending the Old Contracts"
 FE_vls_Events.2.b: "One of the foundational pillars of the Rus and Eastern Orthodoxy as a whole has now been vanquished from being an independent polity. Novgorod no longer stands against us and our rise to power which has granted us an immense amount of influence over the trading centers ranging from the Baltic coastline to the snowy stretches of Karelia and Finland. Truly it can be said that we have succeeded where Yaroslav II of Vladimir left off after being installed on the throne of Novgorod by his older brother, Yuri II; only this time, we will not let Novgorod be self-governing by a member of our royal family.\nSome within the ranks of Vladimir-Suzdal ask over and over for us to do something about Novgorod's annexation as a whole though. Is it worth the time and effort to loot the bountiful city and bring its precious artifacts back to our capital? Maybe we can utilize it as a focal point of trade instead of burning it to the ground. Or, and this may be a much more radical notion, we can use the veche traditions of Novgorod within the wider scope of Vladimir-Suzdal's territorial grasp..."
 FE_vls_Events.2.c: "All that was once Novgorod's shall belong to us!"
 FE_vls_Events.2.d: "They will know no military authority, only mercantile matters now."
 FE_vls_Events.2.e: "Politics can finally come to a rest in this part of the Rus."
 FE_vls_Events.2.f: "Maybe the influential veche can help us with the boyars!"

 FE_vls_Events.3.a: "Streltsy or Druzhina?"
 FE_vls_Events.3.b: "Gunpowder weapons and the influx of new ideas on governance at both the royal level and the communal level have had profound impacts on the revived Grand Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal. The conquests of Novgorod and Moscow are clear displays of our growing power and our neighbors should fear what we may look for next in terms of valuable cities and towns that were once part of Rus. And yet, as our thirst for conquest is still not satiated, the thirst for reform at the societal level is not satiated either. One prominent point of contention that is becoming something we need to deal with is the notion of the old 'druzhina' versus the newer notions of streltsy. \nThe more reformist types in Vladimir-Suzdal are very keen on maintaining the streltsy as they are and even expanding how many streltsy we are capable of mustering; in their eyes, a more professional military force is what is needed to defend ourselves.\nModerates are spread around in our government too, however. They think that giving the boyars of old should not be cut out from military matters as a whole, but rather should be integrated into the streltsy ranks in some form or another. It would cost a fair bit of money and power to do so, but it could be an effective compromise.\nThe last major group to consider are the prominent boyar families themselves who have a fair bit of influence in just about every town and city throughout Vladimir-Suzdal. Though some have taken up the notions of gunpowder and new administrative practice, the majority are keen on keeping their old noble military status and their old status as close advisors to the ruler. Their may be some room to compromise with them, but not much."
 FE_vls_Events.3.c: "The streltsy are here to stay no matter what happens!"
 FE_vls_Events.3.d: "There is a place for both the old and new in Vladimir-Suzdal."

 FE_vls_Events.3.f: "We'll take our time to decide!"

 FE_vls_Events.4.a: "Aid from the Steppe?"
 FE_vls_Events.4.b: "We cannot deny the natural prowess that the steppe people have. Just as we have our own prowess with regards to our own cities of Vladimir-Suzdal, the steppe hordes are masters of decentralized governance and cavalry-based warfare. The clash of these two ways of life and governance can be said to have been a focal point of the Rus for generations now, but the tide is slowly turning as we grow stronger and expand our borders to the south.\nThe Mongol successors are slowly being chipped away at thanks to the soldiers of Vladimir-Suzdal engaging in heated conflicts across the steppe and by the key rivers like the Don and Volga, but still there is a great deal of work to be done. In these times of expansion across a vast swath of land, we risk stretching ourselves thin as our foes in every direction seek to exploit our weaknesses, yet we are not without our own options.\nThere are those of the steppe that we have befriended to some degree. Whether they are remnants of a now fallen khanate or declared allies of Vladimir-Suzdal, we might just be able to garner a long term deal with one of the steppe people groups in our borders to help bolster the ranks of Vladimir-Suzdal, but openly agreeing to such a deal will cause others to view us with less favor overall."
 FE_vls_Events.4.c: "The steppe people of the Upper Volga have the best to offer."

 FE_vls_Events.4.f: "A state of the Rus should rely on Russians, should it not?"

 FE_vls_Events.8.a: "The Rhyme of History"
 FE_vls_Events.8.b: "In the history of Vladimir-Suzdal from before the Mongols invaded, the apex of its power was in 1169 during the reign of Andrey Yuryevich, son of Yuri Dolgorukiy. He, along with Oleg Svyatoslavich and Rostislav Mstislavich, teamed up against the likes of Mstislav II of Kiev and his allies in Volhynia, Novgorod, and Halych. The coalition of eastern princes came about as a result of a myriad of dynastic struggles going on all throughout the Kievan Rus at the time, but ultimately it ended with victory for Andrey's forces in March of 1169. Much like back then, we of the reincarnated Vladimir-Suzdal have harnessed the power of the eastern parts of the Rus and marched westward against the odds to seize what is rightfully ours; our motives may not be the same as the motives of our ancestors, but the end goal is still the same. With Kiev in our fold and the forces of Lithuania and its allies firmly out of contention, we should think upon what to do with Kiev and its surroundings.\nWe could emulate our ancestral sacking of Kiev and loot the entire city for what it has, ensuring that our capital is glorified and our soldiers are well paid, but this would mean burning down a great deal of developed areas in Kiev itself.\nWe could set it up as a western capital of sorts if we are willing to put in the resources to make both its roads are safe and its infrastructure is capable of hosting parts of our administration.\nA third option, one that our advisors say would emulate our ancestors very well, is to let Kiev and its surroundings govern itself under our watchful eyes. It would take a burden off our administration in the west and also allow the local people around Kiev to build up defenses and infrastructure with our oversight."
 FE_vls_Events.8.c: "Kievan decorations sound nice for our capital!"
 FE_vls_Events.8.d: "Send in immediate resources, Kiev is vital to us!"
 FE_vls_Events.8.e: "Just like old times, perhaps..."

 FE_vls_Events.9.a: "Shifting Times, Changing Tides"
 FE_vls_Events.9.b: "We have come so far in the past few generations, have we not? When our ancestors like Andrey Yuryevich saw the peak of power for Vladimir-Suzdal in the 1100s before its steady decline, they did not (or perhaps could not) do much in the way of administrative reform to help consolidate their grip on power. The times were changing rapidly back then, and they could not set up meaningful foundations of power that their children could actively build off of.\nToday is a different age though, one with far more potential in terms of government reformation and organizational movements. Our conquests have brought us to new horizons and put to rest most foolish rivals of our royal family within the lands of the Rus, which means more and more advisors and royal family members are looking toward how internal politics are running.\nThus, the question is finally at hand: how should our internal politics function going forward? We could certainly try to straddle the line between all courtly factions and estates that want power and influence, or we could lean in a certain direction so that most resources in the Rus have a more direct purpose."
 FE_vls_Events.9.c: "An impartial government would serve everyone!"
 FE_vls_Events.9.d: "The internal workings of the Rus are most important, no?"
 FE_vls_Events.9.e: "Rations and resources, all should be geared toward our military!"
 FE_vls_Events.9.f: "Diplomatic efforts will give us much more soft power, of course!"
