 dse_events_general.1.t: "Glorious Flagship"
 dse_events_general.1.d: "Our Flagship is the pride of our navy, and for good reason. Many newcomers and veterans dream of riding her at some point in their career, and even our enemies speak of it in a positive light."
 dse_events_general.1.o1: "Our shipwrights are the best in the world!"
 dse_events_general.1.o2: "Use the notoriety to recruit more men into the navy!"

 dse_events_general.2.t: "Military Theory Publication"
 dse_events_general.2.d: "Recently a manual on military exercises compiled by a little-known officer was published. It details techniques and methods that have proven effective during their time, and could give us an edge. If we act quickly, we can stifle the spread of his works, keeping it all for ourselves… in exchange for a lump sum, of course."
 dse_events_general.2.o1: "Bring them to court."
 dse_events_general.2.o2: "Keep it closely guarded."
 dse_events_general.2.o3: "Our nobility knows better than a commoner."


 dse_events_general.3.t: "Roadside Inns"
 dse_events_general.3.d: "With roads come traffic, and with traffic come those who smell an opportunity. Inns opened to and fro, offering a meal and a bed for travelers. They often remain informal, sometimes barely safer than the roads themselves. Several townships have asked us for assistance."
 dse_events_general.3.o1: "Leave them be."
 dse_events_general.3.o2: "Ensure the roads and inns are protected."
 dse_events_general.3.o3: "Issue licenses for innkeepers."

 dse_events_general.4.t: "Farmland Mismanagement"
 dse_events_general.4.d: "Amidst the pastoral expanse of a once-thriving farmland province, a disconcerting tale unfolds as neglect and mismanagement cast a shadow over its fertile fields.Croplands lay fallow, beset by an overgrowth of weeds, and the irrigation systems, once the lifeblood of the fields, now stand in disrepair. Livestock, once thriving, now show signs of neglect, and the overall productivity of the province has plummeted. This grim scenario beckons for intervention, as the very foundation of this agricultural haven crumbles under the weight of poor governance. How shall we proceed?"
 dse_events_general.4.o1: "Provide full support."
 dse_events_general.4.o2: "Oversee them."
 dse_events_general.4.o3: "They screwed up, let them sort it out."

 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.1.t: "Farmland Reorganised"
 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.1.d: "With our unwavering and comprehensive support, the agricultural expanse, once marred by mismanagement, has not only undergone a complete recovery but has also emerged in a state of enhanced resilience and superiority. It now stands as an optimal focal point for additional development initiatives and a flourishing hub for heightened economic activity."
 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.1.o1: "What a costly endevour."

 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.2.t: "Overseers Oversaw"
 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.2.d: "They arrived, they observed, and they diligently supervised. The overseers, with meticulous attention, have rectified superfluous elements and meticulously pruned any excesses that marred the farmland owners' management. Consequently, the area now stands poised for proper development."
 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.2.o1: "Don't screw up again."
 dse_events_general_farmland_mismanagement_mod_2: "Farmland Overseen"

 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.3.t: "Problem Sorted"
 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.3.d: "The matter at hand, concerning the mismanagement of a farmland, appears to have been rectified of its own accord, absent any direct intervention on our part. Evidently, the decision to refrain from involvement has proven to be the most correct course of action."
 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.3.o1: "Good job!"
 dse_events_general_farmland_mismanagement_mod_3: "Farmland Issue Sorted"

 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.4.t: "Further Mismanagement"
 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.4.d: "Well, guess what? The whole `crossing our fingers and hoping the mismanaged farmland would fix itself` plan? It backfired spectacularly. Things didn't magically get better; they decided to take a nosedive into the abyss. Classic."
 dse_events_farmland_mismanagement.4.o1: "It is what it is."
