 MUG_trunk_road_title: "Grand Trunk Road"
 MUG_trunk_road_desc: "Since time immemorial the Grand Trunk Road has serviced traders and armies in Northern India. This great road connects the important cities of Hindustan, from Bengal to Kabul.\nWe must renovate the Grand Trunk Road, and spare no expense in its maintenance.

 MUG_textile_industry_title: "Textile Industry"

 MUG_industralization_title: "Indian Industralization"
 MUG_industralization_desc: "We have vast resources, a high amount of population, and the technology it needs for us to start our most ambitious program: Industralization.

 MUG_malwa_title: "Southwards Expansion"
 MUG_malwa_desc: "With the fall of the fortresses in western Rajputana the rich Malwa plateau now lies open before us. The conquest of this region would both enlarge the Imperial treasury and open for future campaigns against Gujarat and the Deccan states. It is our fortune that the Malwa Sultans have been weak and allowed local interest groups too much free rein. This has left the area divided and easy to integrate for a more efficient state such as ours."

 MUG_economic_reform_title: "Modernize the Economy"

 MUG_taxation_system_title: "Dahsala System"
 MUG_taxation_system_desc: "Much of our taxes are being lost to either greed, miscommunication, our outright lack of a centralized system. By taxing each area from its crops each year we can gain money from the prospering areas, whilst allowing the declining regions to regain their wealth."

 MUG_cultures_title: "Cultures of India"

 MUG_the_subahs_title: "The Twelve Subahs"
 MUG_the_subahs_desc: "Needless to say the Indian subcontinent is absolutely colossal, it’s nearly 45 million square kilometres. Administering such large landmass can be at times borderline impossible, we can simply not rely on old methods of administration to rule over such a girthy and wide empire with such extreme variety in people and terrains. This coupled with the fact that the overwhelming majority of our subjects are of foreign faith, that being Hinduism has put many of our bureaucrats at their wits end. Something must be done, our empire will crumble under the weight of paperwork."
 
 MUG_qadi_title: "Qadi in the Court"
 MUG_qadi_desc: "The responsibilities of a nation at first sound numerous but when summarised are rather simple, the Romans were famous for saying ‘’breads and circuses’’. And while food and entertainment are indeed quite important services, law and order is perhaps as equally as important. While our subjects are Hindu and we are an empire of tolerance at the end of day we are an Islamic empire and because of such we enforce Islamic law. Sure, sometimes we compromise by not cutting off the hand of a bread thief but that does not change the fact that the ruling class of the empire is Hanafi and that the state law is that of Sharia law. In short, we shall introduce Qadis into court to facilitate the enforcement of law and make the state more efficient at law and order. This will aid us greatly in ruling our lands from a more centralised position."
 
 MUG_new_capital_title: "A New Capital"
 MUG_new_capital_desc: "By far the heart of the empire and the main seat of power is in the Northern plains, here lies the capital of many old Indian empires and vast majority of our belligerent and numerous subjects. Our current capital is the one of the old Delhi sultanate, it is a city where the people are particularly numerous, the elite particularly belligerent. The city also has massive amounts of urban sprawl to the point the empire’s best and brightest cartography and architects cannot make sense of any of it."
 
 MUG_indian_iron_title: "Indian Iron"
 MUG_indian_iron_desc: "Southern India in particular is a producer of countless different goods ranging from luxuries such as spices to more essential goods like iron. Iron is a very valuable commodity, as it is massively consequential for producing a multitude of goods. Including tools and specifically weapons, which results in it being highly sought after. To profit, it would do us good to expand our iron-production capabilities in Southern India by developing the local industry."
 
 MUG_tamil_title: "The Tamil People"
 MUG_tamil_desc: "The Tamil people are people of faith and most importantly of trade, they lay at the very end of the Indian subcontinent between Nusutara and Arabia, ships sail into their ports to resupply and buy silk and spices produced in the local area. This results in them being highly prosperous people, a land with massive amounts of wealth and money.\n\nAnother peculiarity of the area is that the Tamil people are very steadfast in trade but also in their faith, which makes it difficult to draw large draw amount of men from the area, this could be resolved by coercing the people away from their faith into hands of Islam, but this would could conflict with the affluent Tamil merchants."
 
 MUG_arabia_sea_title: "The Strait of Hormuz"
 MUG_arabia_sea_desc: "The strait of Hormuz links the Persian gulf to the Indian ocean which results in massive amounts of silk road passing through it. By setting a trade toll on all ships passing through the strait we can make large amounts of money effortlessly, all we need to do is control the island of Hormuz to have enough clout to enforce said toll."
 
 MUG_persia_border_title: "The Persian Border"
 MUG_persia_border_desc: "Few places are as valuable for production, trade and empire building as Persia. It’s been home to countless empires and is the origin of ours, the vast majority of our political elite including our Padishah come from these lands. We have much to thank Persia for, we should return the favour by ruling over its lands, as it will greatly strengthen our position by giving us easier access to countless riches of Persia and India."
 
 MUG_indian_trade_title: "Indian Trade"
 MUG_indian_trade_desc: "One of the first innovations of humankind was the development of trade, people exchanged goods with each other to obtain what they truly wanted. Humankind further innovated by inventing coinage, which further facilitated trade. We dominate the Indian subcontinent, countless different types of goods are produced in our lands and then sold to other nations and markets which makes us fabulously rich. Our location is optimal to be an economic powerhouse in Asia, we produce, we import, we export. Our importance when it comes to trade rivals those of Rome and Mongols, and even current empires like China. Indian trade is a word that is worth its weight in gold."
 
 MUG_bengal_industry_title: "Bengalese Industry"
 MUG_bengal_industry_desc: "Few areas in the world are as monumental as the Bengal delta and surrounding lands, the sheer fertility of said lands turn Bengal into one of most prosperous areas on the planet, Bengali goods can be found throughout the world. People often mention places like Mesopotamia as incredibly prodigious. Yet our Bengali lands are the ones who have reached a state of proto-industrialisation, where absolutely staggering amounts of goods are produced through a combination of natural and built infrastructure. To summarise my liege, we are stinking rich."
 
 MUG_indian_spice_title: "Indian Spice"
 MUG_indian_spice_desc: "The spice trade developed as early as 2000 BCE with cinnamon and black pepper, and it has never left the Indian subcontinent. When one speaks of spice they often have to specify whether they meant Indian spices, for they are renowned throughout the globe. In short, it would be foolish of us to not secure at minimum a minor monopoly on spice trade. As to fill our coffers to the brim with coins and riches from spice hungry individuals willing to trade for our spices."
 
 MUG_orissa_title: "Conquer Orissa"
 MUG_orissa_desc: "We have finalised our conquest of Orissa, which is perhaps one of the most rural and tribal parts of the Indian subcontinent. The land is prime to be built on and urbanised, sporting tropical wood and other local goods ideal for construction. It also borders the bay of Bengal, so perhaps it would be most wise to expand the ports of Orissa. As to further our stranglehold of the bay and the greater East Indian Ocean."
 
 MUG_sepoys_title: "Founding the Sepoys"
 MUG_sepoys_desc: "The heart of any army is its cannon fodder, more affectionately known as infantry. While the roots of our nation may be Persian, we are an Indian state. Our infantrymen are almost exclusively of Indian origin, they very much form the bulk of our forces and for such we must formalise their positions and rank, and cement our overlordship over them. This will make it easier to command and assert over who's in charge, which will not only make them more effective in combat, but also less likely to turn tail and run. "
 
 MUG_ahadis_title: "Expanding the Ahadis"
 MUG_ahadis_desc: "Having swaths of land from where we recruit swarms of infantry to expand our realm has worked succinctly so far but these men are loyal to coin over us, and even more loyal to their lives then coin. They are unreliable at best and untrustworthy at worst. We must formalise a standing army that is not loyal to gold and plunder, one of the ways to buy this greater loyalty is ironically more coins, but another is by recruiting men who are directly related to the emperor. Whether that be due to blood or tribe. Not only will these men be far more reliable, they will be a fierce force who will fight tooth and nail to strike down any isolents who dare become our enemies. Whether that be foreign or domestic threats, they will always side with the emperor. They shall make those who oppose the emperor cave in, they will face either death or dishonour."
 
 MUG_rajput_recruitment_title: "Rajput Army"
 MUG_rajput_recruitment_desc: "Rajputs are people of rural lands, a pastoral background. They are a large caste of many different groups and people primarily located in Northern West India, but that is not the part that interests us. The interesting bit is that these people are famous for their warriorhood culture, they have formed formidable empires before and have decimated several Muslim states before, Delhi in particular got decimated several times in their conflicts against Rajputs. We will not be so foolish, the rajputs were here before and shall be here after. Instead of making enemies of each other we shall be allies, well more master and servant but it shall be a mutually beneficial relationship. We shall have excellent specialised infantry, and they shall have our trust and consistent salary."
 
 MUG_marathi_title: "Marathi Recruits"
 MUG_marathi_desc: "If Rajputs are peasants then Marathas are peasants who possess some actual wealth. With said wealth they like to pay for regular and luxurious goods like most, but where they really like to utilise their wealth upon is the military. Much like if not more than Rajputs, the military is the focal point of their society. The marathas are exceptional horsemen, capable of using their large amounts of wealth to afford large amounts of cavalry they train extensively with and subsequently use with devastating effect on the battlefield. They are formidable foes for both their size and flexibility, most empires would move quickly to smite them down. But why would we crush a system that is working perfectly fine, when we can simply adapt it and send it in the direction of our enemies?"
 
 MUG_recruits_title: "Standardize Recruitment"
 MUG_recruits_desc: "Few strengths are as overwhelming as flexibility, we swoop in, crush whoever lays in front of us, assimilate its structure and utilise its lands and people to swoop into next territory. Rinse and repeat this format and you will go from a small kingdom in mountains to distressing the son of heaven. Much like Mongols, Greeks and Chinese themselves this has been our approach, we simply adapt to the land and situation we find ourselves and utilise it for our means. While that flexibility is beyond useful it makes actual warfare an absolute nightmare, Indian archers, persian musketeers, Gujarati cavalry with different tactics and equipment then turkoman. While such variety is nice, it makes reinforcing any units that take casualties in battle nightmarish, nightmarish! We must standardise recruitment so we can simply assign men to whatever units are missing soldiers."
 
 MUG_artillery_title: "Artillery to Warfare"
 MUG_artillery_desc: "Since the very dawn of humanity we have been in a race, an arms race. First came the sharpening of sticks then rocks, we eventually discovered bronze and ironworking. One of reasons for Alexander's subjugation of the Persian empire was his absurdly large yet effective spears. Naturally when it comes to innovating in carnage and senseless murder of large numbers of people its the Chinese, gunpowder is of chinese origin and can be utilised to create explosives and firearms. Single regiment of firearm wielding men can swath away entire armies, or get crushed and killed while causing massive casualties. But that is just with puny small firearms, a regiment with artillery can crumble armies, make fortress rubble, large cannons are mandatory in modern warfare. By integrating artillery properly into our armies and making it a core belief of our forces we will be able to utilise gunpowder to turn our enemies into powder."
 
 MUG_gunpowder_empire_title: "A Gunpowder Empire"
 MUG_gunpowder_empire_desc: "There’s couple things inherent to our nation; assimilation, islam, gunpowder and colossal. We are not any old islamic empire, we embody something of old islamic empires, of original caliphates. Innovation, we’ve innovated in warfare like no one before. Just like how we took the idea of tolerance and ran with it, we took the idea of gunpowder and ran with it. Mughal artillery is horrific, for our enemies that is. We turn fortresses into sandcastles, cities into flatlands, armies into fertiliser. Vallies roar with the sound of gunfire, trees shake, entire regions go deaf from our barrages. Our bullets and shells blot out the sun, our enemies die in darkness, they die blind and deaf."
 
 MUG_sowar_title: "Sowar Cavalry"
 MUG_sowar_desc: "One of the tenants of our traditional approach to warfare is cavalry, its speed allows it to smash into enemies and shock them to their core. Yet we do not have formalised ranks for our cavalry. Not only is this disrespectful to our men on horseback, it also makes them less effective for it is more difficult to manage large amounts of riders while not having them organised by having explicit rank. By introducing the title of Sowar we will not only be able to organise our cavalry better including men for hire, but also competency of our cavalry due it feeling rewarded for its service."
 
 MUG_mansabdar_expand_title: "Expand the Mansabdar"
 MUG_mansabdar_expand_desc: "An army without officers is simply a ban of angry unwashed men, an army without a general is like headless hydra. Sure both are capable of wreaking havoc, yet neither is excellent nor precise with it. Headless hydra will trash around and wither away, a band of unwashed men will simply collapse in on themselves our die of starvation, this assuming they survive any type of combat and don’t immediately fracture. While we have a formalised system for the ruler caste of the army it is nowhere near modernised enough for the sheer amount and importance of our army. More efficient ruler caste will facilitate fielding large quantities of men immensely, while also making the upholding of such caste easier."
 
 MUG_traditions_title: "Traditional Warfare"
 MUG_traditions_desc: "Does warfare innovatie? Sure, things change, new tactics are invented, new weapons like muskets are created. Yet why do kings, generals, sometimes even the common pleb still quote the Art of War? Because the essence of warfare doesn’t change, from swords to spears, from spears to firearms. All it is is huge waves of men being thrown one against another, and while having shiny new weapons helps, who cares if you cannot organise your men effectively? Who cares if you do not have men to equip your new weapons with? Who cares if your men crumble at first sight of battle? Who are we disagree with that? Who are we to say Alexander was a fool, if it worked for him? Do we dare disagree with Khalid bin al-Waleed? With Genghis and Timur? The list of great conquerors is endless, yet all of them have things in common. Bunch of men being told what to do and what ensues is nothing short of magical, crushing victory."
 
 MUG_navy_title: "The Mughal Navy"
 MUG_navy_desc: "Our aspiring empire is very much one that rules from the land. Yet we are adjacent to the Indian ocean, an ocean where immeasurable amounts of wealth is transported through in forms of valuable goods like spices, silk and more. It is an ocean that connects Arabia, Africa and beyond to the lands of Nusantara and China. For such it would do us good to build a navy capable of enforcing our will, that be to protect our own goods and people. Or to keep our rivals and enemies out of our seas, or have them be sunk when entering them."
 
 MUG_europe_title: "Contact with Europe"
 MUG_europe_desc: "While the European continent has many front regressive and backwards both morally and technologically. As they have no equivalent to Islamic golden age, the invention of gunpowder by Chinese or invention of modern numerals created by Indian scholars and perfected by Islamic scholars. Yet they do have a couple of decent ideas and at minimum are geographic areas distinct enough to provide some insight into new realms of science and possibilities. By establishing close ties with European power we could innovate even further, and advance in becoming the crib of technological advancement and prosperity in the world. And I’m sure our ally will benefit from the alliance too, probably."
 
 MUG_sea_title: "Malay Trade"
 MUG_sea_desc: "Malaya, more well known as Nusantara is a chain of islands where elements of India can be recognised. It is land home to Hindus ruled by Muslims states. Where a multitude of different ethnic groups live, and different types of climates and geography can be found. A land where a variety of goods are produced ranging from similar ones to India like spices and cotton, to far more unique ones relative to India like Cloves, Chinaware and incense. This not even mentioning the fact that a lot of Chinese, Japanese and other east Asian trade passes through these islands. It would do us good to increase our influence and power in this region for aforementioned reasons, whether it be through diplomacy by pen or by gunboat."
 
 MUG_burma_mission_title: "Burma Ambitions"
 MUG_burma_mission_desc: "The lands of Burma are not too dissimilar to India, they are lands of plenty with many different cultures and resources, both of which would be useful in our growing empire. It also could harbour potential enemies which could strike and hurt our lands in Bengal and be nothing short of disastrous to our state’s economy. This coupled with the fact it lies between China, Indochina and Nusantara are all prime reasons to incorporate Burma into our realm."
 
 MUG_sea_conquest_title: "Securing the Spice"
 MUG_sea_conquest_desc: "While subjugation in southern India already gives us a small monopoly on spice trade and the sheer wealth and prestige Indian spice carries, India is not known as the land of spice. That is Nustarana, also known as the spice islands. Increasing our influence in this area goes hand in hand with our usage of the grand navy as to become the trade hegemon of Asia. We must spread our influence either through faith and diplomacy or through military might and conquest. Not to mention it will give us an avenue to the Cantonese ports in China, now let's sail forwards, for riches await us!"
 
 MUG_china_title: "Cantonese Ports"
 MUG_china_desc: "Canton, China. One of richest areas in the world, part of one of the most dominant, if not the most dominant culture to ever exist. People speak of Alexander, Persia, Rome, the Caliphate, the Mongols and nowadays us with a hint of awe in their voice, but China is a nation in its own league. It has existed for longer than most can remember, and is the only state to compare to us in sheer population and wealth, yet it triumphs us in both. Needless to say, it is our interest to tap into this wealth, but there is a question to be asked. Do we befriend the Chinese behemoth? Conduct diplomacy, trade and influence its population through faith. Or do we topple the giant? If the Mongols could do it, and the Chinese topple themselves every couple hundred years, then why can we not do it ourselves? After all, China is full of loot to plunder, and we should stop nothing short of being the greatest realm to ever exist."
 
 MUG_sea_dominance_title: "Hegemony Over Trade"
 MUG_sea_dominance_desc: "Hegemon, derived from the Greek word ‘hegemonia’ used by rulers of Macedonia to ascertain their absolute dominance over the Greek world, the title used by Alexander himself. It was title befitting of Alexander, and now it is title befitting of us. For when it comes to the world of trade we are its hegemon, no one buys goods from Asia without us having say in it. Now one makes a coin of trade without us having our fair dues. Spice trade, silk road, all terms renowned by their sheer wealth carried through them. But those are outdated terms, for Mughal trade encomposes them all and more. Silk, gold, spices, precious metals, cotton, coffee, gems, chinaware, incense, the list goes on, and on, and on, and on of what can be bought off our markets. The Asian market is the Mughal market. The global economy is a Mughal economy. Tremble at our trade, tremble!"
 
 MUG_naval_supplies_title: "Bolstering our Naval Supplies"
 MUG_naval_supplies_desc: "While the quality of trade supplies are already above that of the average state, the amount we produce will simply not suffice. We shall have to be more stern with the quality of our products, this will be done as to sharpen quality standards on certain parts as to bring down maintenance costs. All of this shall be done while either staying at the same production capacity or even increasing it due to streamlining. This will result in not only being capable of keeping a larger navy, but also bringing down costs for upkeep said navy. It is not enough to simply be a colossal nation with colossal infrastructure adjacent to the Indian ocean, we must also innovate as to stay ahead of the curve."
 
 MUG_expanding_fleet_title: "Expansion of our Fleet"
 MUG_expanding_fleet_desc: "We’ve laid the foundations of the Mughal navy, mastered shipbuilding, bolstered our naval supplies and drilled our seamen into real sailors. Now it is time to reap what we have sown and expand our fleet to a level never seen before, but there is a decision to be made. Do we focus on heavy ships capable of tearing navies into two and barrage coastal cities into submission? Or do we focus on lighter ships? Still capable of warfare but outclassed by heavier ships, but in turn lighter ships compensate by being perfect for trade. We could always take a balanced approach, a balance between warfare and trade. Regardless it is time to expand our fleet, long live the Mughals, the Mughals rule the waves!"
 
 MUG_shipbuilding_title: "Shipbuilding Masters"
 MUG_shipbuilding_desc: "The Indian empires and nations are not known in history for being naval powers yet all of them have proud histories of seafaring. Not only that but multiple Indian people and states like Chola, Vijayanagara, Kalinga and more were mighty naval powers who dominated the Indian ocean and trade that followed within it. All were most definitely shipbuilding masters. Yet all of them live in shadows of other naval states like Chinese and Nusatran kingdoms, but no more! We shall build a navy like no other, and said navy shall dominate the Indian ocean and beyond. The quality of our trade goods shall be second to none, for we can only use the best for construction of our new grand armada. The grand armada that shall be constructed by building the grandest of shipyards, Indian harbours and ports will dwarf all others!"
 
 MUG_indian_sailors_title: "Indian Sailors"
 MUG_indian_sailors_desc: "There’s many things that go into ship, even more into navy. You got actual wood, iron, sails but also things like ropes, anchors and more. That is simply for construction of the ship, they also need to be outstripped with supplies for repairing, but also consumption, ammunition for cannons and more. You also got things like naval commanders, maps, tools to sail the seas. You need harbours and ports, to house and construct the ships. All of these things are finite, yet not too troublesome to replace, besides for perhaps the naval infrastructure. But the one thing that you need in massive droves and you can run out of is sailors, ships need men to service them. While we do have sailors, many of these are decently unfamiliar with the sea, certainly with the warfare part. We must drill our sailors better and reward acts of courage and bravery."

 #Events:
 ME_Mughal_Events.1.t: "Fall of Delhi"
 ME_Mughal_Events.1.d: "Delhi lies at our feet, the previous capital of the largest Indian sultanate in India to date, and one of largest Indian empires ever called this city their home, their capital. Now the city is ours, the city and surrounding lands are of great value, for they reside in fertile lands of gangetic plateau. Our next step of action will be to spruce up the city, for it will be a valuable pearl in our empire we will utilise to fuel or further conquests of plateau and India itself. It is wise to move our seat of power to what was the seat of power of the former empire in the area, for it will provide the basis for our new Persian empire in India."
 ME_Mughal_Events.1.a: "[522.GetName] will serve as our new capital."
 ME_Mughal_Events.1.b: "Loot it. Their riches are ours."
 ME_Mughal_Events.1.c: "We will preserve the city."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.2.t: "The Throne of Hindustan"
 ME_Mughal_Events.2.d: "We have done it, we have secured our spot as a major player in the Indian scene and our nasency for empirehood. The seeds of an empire are ours, those seeds being the lands of Hindustan. Gangetic plains have been the core of any Northern Indian empire, such valuable lands provide the basis for further conquest and domination. There are many talented people whose talent is necessary for a growing state, there’s even more untalented masses who can provide service in other ways like production or recruitment into the army. Regardless we have secured the foundations for our future, where our empire will be built upon. Such a grandiose achievement should be celebrated with a new throne for the emperor, although we can always ascertain our position by forcing them to bend the knee to our emperor, literally."
 ME_Mughal_Events.2.a: "The throne is mine."
 ME_Mughal_Events.2.b: "They will bend their knee to me."
 ME_Mughal_Events.2.c: "Our conquest of Hindustan has come to an end."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.3.t: "Exploiting Gujarat's Wealth"
 ME_Mughal_Events.3.d: "Gujarat is a curious land, its peninsula adjacent to a desert on Western Indian coast. It is filled to the brim variety and as always, people. But Gujarat's location is the point of contention, its positioning makes its markets the place where the entirety of Indian trade meets and flows to the west, where lands like Arabia and Persia reside. It has absolutely immense value and even more potential, so we have a choice to make. Do we sack its land for the riches it can provide to fund our further conquests or do we invest into these lands so we can profiteer from them properly? It will perhaps hurt our momentum but pay off in the future."
 ME_Mughal_Events.3.a: "Anything to help fund our wars."
 ME_Mughal_Events.3.b: "We are conquerors, not looters."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.4.t: "Triumph in Rajputana"
 ME_Mughal_Events.4.d: "Rajputana is troublesome land to say the least, the home of many Indian empires, hindu ones too. A powerful warrior class reigns in these lands, the rajputs are most effective and most dedicated warriors. They are always ready to slaughter armies larger than them, and establish new states on top of their corpses. For such our victory over these people is a great triumph most definitely worthy of celebration, but while for us it’s time bankets on our exquisite cuisine, it is a time of worry for the rest of India. For if the rajputs have fallen to us, what chance do they have? Because of such we must be careful with how we decide to treat our new territories, is it perhaps best to be cautious and attempt to lessen the worries of the other Indian states. Or do we treat our newest addition to the realm however we wish, indirectly sending a strong message to the other states in the subcontinent. That we are not only not concerned for their opinion but will subdue them just like how we subdued the Rajasthani."
 ME_Mughal_Events.4.a: "Victory here may be achieved, but let us not anger the rest of India."
 ME_Mughal_Events.4.b: "The rest of the people will know of our might!"
 ME_Mughal_Events.4.c: "A mighty parade in the region, displaying our triumph."
 ME_Mughal_Events.4.d: "Let us make the locals happy instead for legitimacy."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.5.t: "Re-Organizing the Malwa Area"
 ME_Mughal_Events.5.d: "Another valuable piece of India has fallen below us and low behold, it is yet another plateau, one of countless in India. Malwa will prove thoroughly useful as a springboard to furth conquests down south. Due to its geography is not only Malwa like previously stated, a very valuable addition to our ever growing domain, it's also fairly distinct to lands surrounding it, which makes assigning a governor to it specifically quite wise. Assigning a governor from Malwa itself would be optimal, as it would make administration much easier and the province considerably more prosperous, but such can only be done if we trust our Malawi subjects."
 ME_Mughal_Events.5.a: "Any governor will do, as long as he covers our back."
 ME_Mughal_Events.5.b: "We should put a Malvi prince in charge."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.6.t: "Subjugation of the Deccani People"
 ME_Mughal_Events.6.d: "The subjugation of Deccan and its people is no small feat! Many (Northern) Indian empires have attempted such and either failed or even destroyed themselves in the process. So our victory over these lands and people is inspiring to say the least! Yet again we have added another valuable jewel to the ever growing crown of India and beyond. The fine paper of Bahmani in particular shall be a lucrative endeavour that will benefit our state coffers! Naturally conquest isn’t the easiest, the amount of planning, funding, winning battles, managing sieges and more are all difficult work. But conquest is only half the battle, ruling and administering is an even larger struggle. So being able to subdue these proud people would truly result in our nation’s acclaim, to be seen as most prestigious and splendorous."
 ME_Mughal_Events.6.a: "Let them know of our conquests."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.7.t: "Viceroyalty of Deccan"
 ME_Mughal_Events.7.d: "It cannot be stressed enough what sheer size and value the Decanni plateau holds. It is an absolutely massive swath of land with countless people and their byproducts residing within this plateau. This not mentioning the lands south west of the plateau, the eastern ghats and coast. While all of this territory has tremendous value, it also provides absolute gargantuan administrative burden. For not only are there countless people to govern, there are a variety of cultural differences between North and South India which cause tensions and difficulties which have consequences for administration in other territories and conquest of new lands. A solution to this problem could very well be to simply make it someone else's problem, making these lands have slightest hint of autonomy and independence would ease the burden and provide a loyal subject who would tax their own populace and raise its own army loyal to us. But keeping these rich lands under our direct rule is rather tempting too, we could remedy the issue by simply investing a lot more into efficiency and effectiveness of our administration, although this will not provide any extra boons of removing the North-South divide."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.7.a: "We will rule them directly."
 ME_Mughal_Events.7.b: "Perhaps a Viceroyalty can manage the land there."
 ME_Mughal_Events.7.c: "A Viceroyalty can help us manage the rest of the realm too."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.8.t: "A True Heir of Timur"
 ME_Mughal_Events.8.d: "Everyone speaks of Genghis, Julius, Alexander but no one speaks of Timur, and they are all fools for doing so. Timur is one of the greatest conquerors to ever live on earth, he created an empire the size of some largest Persian empires yet within one lifetime. And unlike certain conquerors, which simply conquered many fragmented lands, or severely weakened empires, Timur’s lands were subjugated from several large states and he thoroughly beat every single major empire that opposed him. We are sons and daughters of this great man, and we have honoured his legacy by doing something he’d be most proud of, we subjugated all of India. A title no other state has ever held the right to claim, not even Maurya of old managed to unify this great subcontinent, it is our title and our title alone to proudly uphold. We have unquestionably cemented the legitimacy of our rule by the historic subjugation we have achieved. How can one question our expansion if we have simply unified our rightful domain? This is truly the dawn of a new age, the only path forwards is to consolidate our realm to hegemon of Asia if not the world, and naturally, expand even more."
 ME_Mughal_Events.8.a: "We shall go beyond India!"
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.9.t: "Beyond Bengal"
 ME_Mughal_Events.9.d: "The Bengali delta is ours, the one delta capable of rivalling the Nile is no longer just within our grasp but within our hands. When it comes to jewels, it is perhaps the shiniest of them all in India. The amount of people, food, valuable goods and more that exist within these lands is incredible, almost feels unquantifiable. But what is more unquantifiable than Bengal is our ambitions, the lands of Burma lay east of our new territories. Burma is not too dissimilar to India in certain aspects, perhaps a bit more backwards compared to its subcontinent cousin. But its land nonetheless, land whose people occasionally raze and pillage Bengal. So it would be in our best interest to bring our benevolence and tolerance to these people by force. But it's no mystery that ambition and recklessness has been the death of countless empires, and while ambition has been healthy for us, it could also bring us to ruin. Perhaps it would be wiser to simply build fortifications for now? It would make our east safer and allows us to focus elsewhere while still enjoying the labours of Bengal."
 ME_Mughal_Events.9.a: "Burma shall be ours!"
 ME_Mughal_Events.9.b: "Our ambitions end here."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.10.t: "End of the Sindh Campaign"
 ME_Mughal_Events.10.d: "Now that we have wrestled control of Sindh we have started to gain power within the Gujarati market, this new found trade will be greatly beneficial to our state and we will further build upon this by wrestling even more control of Gujarat. But question remains, do we focus on improving the trading capabilities of new found land or do lay claim to the trading outposts that lie in Arabia as to increase our stranglehold of trade down the corridor?"
 ME_Mughal_Events.10.a: "We will focus on expanding our influence in the Arabic Sea."
 ME_Mughal_Events.10.b: "It is better to protect our current borders."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.11.t: "The Spice Trade"
 ME_Mughal_Events.11.d: "Indian spice is one of most highly sought after commodities in the world and we have achieved monopoly within this niche market. It is certainly profitable in the domestic market, for anyone sensible relishes in the deliciousness of spice. But it is foreign market that makes spice an immensely lucrative endeavour. From China to Europe, traders sail great seas and merchants cross great expanses of deserts, mountains and more for our spices. Simply focusing on luxury and value of Indian spice would already make us immensely rich, but it would not be true monopoly, for the lands in south east asia occupy even more spice, arguably rivalling ours. We could lay claims to these as to achieve true monopoly and jack up prices even more!"
 ME_Mughal_Events.11.a: "No need to extend our influence. Our spice works just as well."
 ME_Mughal_Events.11.b: "The spice trade must flow."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.12.t: "Mughal Spice Monopoly"
 ME_Mughal_Events.12.d: ""
 ME_Mughal_Events.12.a: "The spice shall flow only for us."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.13.t: "Founding Agra City"
 ME_Mughal_Events.13.d: "Often the solution to capitals which create more problems than solutions is to simply create a new capital city, the new proposed capital would be in Middle Doab. This province is right next to our current capital which would facilitate any transfers of our power but would allow us to build a capital city more to our liking. We should start the construction of some basic infrastructure to prepare the province for transfer of power, and if at the end we rather keep the old city, we shall have a new powerful city right next to our current capital, a win-win."
 ME_Mughal_Events.13.a: "It shall serve as our new capital."
 ME_Mughal_Events.13.b: "Our old capital is just as fine."
 ME_Mughal_Events.13.c: "This city will now know new heights."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.14.t: "Extending Our Reach"
 ME_Mughal_Events.14.d: "The lands of Orissa are certainly memorable, powerful states have emerged from its coast, for they are quite suitable for exerting control over Bengali gulf and profit from the large amounts of trade conducted. Many people call Orissa their home, but what is perhaps more remarkable then these peasants is the large amount of tropical woods that reside in Orissa, these lands are perhaps some of the most tribal, ancient and underdeveloped and uninhabited places in India. The consequences of being so primitive are abundant amounts of jungles filled with wood that is perfect for constructing and building up the local area, for there is plenty of place and things to build. But this wood could also be utilised to strengthen the eastern ports, but there only is so much wood."
 ME_Mughal_Events.14.a: "We will focus on developing the area."
 ME_Mughal_Events.14.b: "With these new ports, we can begin on constructing a fleet."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.15.t: "Establishment of a New Army"
 ME_Mughal_Events.15.d: "The most important part of a state is its army, one cannot raise taxes with the threat of execution, pillaging and starvation. One can not keep court or nobility loyal without having men to slaughter the traitors with. Armies can also occasionally be utilised incase of famine or natural disasters, or even as builders. But besides for the many, many, many and I cannot stress this enough, many internal threats. There’s also countless external threats, rival states that wish to conquer our land at literally every second, not that we take it personally, we would do the same to them. Which is why we need to reform our army, to fight off invasion and allow for invasions of our Thing is, how will we make our army the most terrifying on the field? Do we refine traditional warfare to its apex, and dominate through founded traditions and trusted methods. Or do we innovate on ideas of chinese, turn those fireworks into something that will allow us to burn down and destroy entire armies and cities?"
 ME_Mughal_Events.15.a: "We will maintain the people's fighting traditions."
 ME_Mughal_Events.15.b: "A modern Gunpowder Empire. Our strength will be adaptability."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.16.t: "Strengthening the Diwan"
 ME_Mughal_Events.16.d: "The Mughal state is synonymous with Diwan, it is one of if not the main reason we have managed to grow so quickly and achieve such tremendous results. The level of acceptance and integration this form of rule gives us allows us to assimilate foreign cultures and mitigate ideas of unrest and the such. This is not even mentioning that India and the broader world is full of educated, capable people all who have useful services they can provide to the state when it comes to what they excel. Were we to put even greater emphasis on assimilation we could benefit from the unique bonuses the different cultures in our empire give us. Or we could simply focus on supremacy of government itself, such centralised absolute rule is always of use."
 ME_Mughal_Events.16.a: "A focus on assimilation will suit us best."
 ME_Mughal_Events.16.b: "The government itself is in need of power."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.17.t: "The Coinage Reforms of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 ME_Mughal_Events.17.d: "Reforming coinage is not a rare thing for various reasons, sometimes its due to the metals utilised in coin production becoming rarer, perhaps the coins in circulation are of old or foreign state and cannot be reproduced. Or perhaps counterfeiting is running rampant. For us there are many reasons, lack of standardisation is one, in general anything that is gold and looks real is accepted as valuta, but such thing is dangerous for we might be getting tricked or let inflation run amok. For such our emperor is proud to announce a new coinage and for such reforms to be done, this is our emperor's personal project so he wishes to dedicate himself to the fullest to this project and put himself in charge. They are most competent so the reforms are quite radical yet effective, but were to lose our great leader it would throw the entirety of reform into disarray and hurt it considerably. For such perhaps taking a milder approach, distributing responsibilities and lowering ambitions would be a safer approach."
 ME_Mughal_Events.17.a: "A more safe course of reforms."
 ME_Mughal_Events.17.b: "Our reforms will be radical as possible."
 ME_Mughal_Events.17.c: "Let us take advice from our court."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.18.t: "Creating Akbar's New Government"
 ME_Mughal_Events.18.d: "Islamic states in broad strokes have always been tolerant states, Indian sultanates specifically almost have to follow this doctrine of tolerance due to the fact that majority of their population is not only not of the muslim faith. But it is also generally of a singular religion, making rulership even more troublesome. But such a thing doesn’t have to, and for us hasn’t really been an issue. Our policy of tolerance has not only mitigated the issue but if anything allowed it to use it to our advantage. But we shouldn't be content with simply adapting the governments of previous states, for many of them have fallen before so something must be afoot with their way of doing things. We should reform our government and reach news highs!"
 ME_Mughal_Events.18.a: "We shall go with it."
 ME_Mughal_Events.18.b: "Only a small amount."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.20.t: "The City of Ava"
 ME_Mughal_Events.20.d: "Ava is one of the great cities of Burma, it has been the seat of power of the dominant state in Burma several times. It is a highly valuable city for it resides next to the Irrawaddy river, situated where it splits off into two of its distributary rivers. Much of Burma’s wealth is funnelled into this city, so sacking it would reap the values of Burma without actually hurting the lands too much, it would most definitely fill up our treasury nicely where we could funnel the wealth into wherever we preferred. But putting Ava on a pedestal would perhaps be a wiser choice, as to extract the wealth and prestige of Burma more effectively and provide another valuable area of land to our ever growing empire."
 ME_Mughal_Events.20.a: "We will loot it."
 ME_Mughal_Events.20.b: "Let us elevate the city in Burma."
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.21.t: "The Chinese Trade"
 ME_Mughal_Events.21.d: "It was not enough for us to simply monopolise things like Indian trade nor south asian or spices. We have become the market leader in south chinese trade, yet another opportunity bestowed by us due to our efforts that will make us fabulously wealthy. Yet the governing of China is not the easiest of affairs, it is like India in population, yet far more homogenous and worse, loyal to their leaders of their fellow culture. Our business here can be summarised as purely for the sake of trade, which is why creating a vassal in Southern China dedicated to the market might be wise. But we are powerful people and our merchants are crafty and shrewd, we can always continue with direct subjugation and try to win over the populace by religious conversion."
 ME_Mughal_Events.21.a: "We will establish a trading vassal there"
 ME_Mughal_Events.21.b: "It is our merchants that will prosper there"
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.22.t: "Establishing The Subahs"
 ME_Mughal_Events.22.d: "No place is quite like India, it is such a colossal place filled to the brim with variety and people. The areas, states, parts that make up India share similarities, yet are also radically different in certain aspects. For such an administration is beyond troublesome, for adapting one large plan for the whole state is not only hard, but inefficient. It is perhaps most wise to divide our lands into smaller administrative regions, this will ease the burden of administration and exploit our lands to what they excel at respectively. Yet we have engaged in continuous decentralisation and decentralisation is a dangerous game. Not necessarily because it will backfire but due to missing the opportunities of centralisation. A focus on centralised, absolutist rule would allow use to rule more efficiently with an iron fist, perhaps bringing long term benefits in the future."
 ME_Mughal_Events.22.a: "We cannot possibly administrate all of India"
 ME_Mughal_Events.22.b: "We will not throw away our power just like that"
 
 ME_Mughal_Events.23.t: "Focusing on the Subahs"
 ME_Mughal_Events.23.d: " "
