We might be able to invite the progenitor of this thought to our court, and bask in his innovative mind, given someone has not gotten ahead of us."

 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.1.t: "Petition from [From.GetName]"
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.1.d: "An envoy of several priests has arrived from [From.GetName] alongside a very important request. The [From.GetAdjective] firmly believe that [Root.Religion.GetName] is on the decline in the Low Countries as the church there is disorganized. Few bishoprics, parishes, cloisters are but a few complaints. We could very much dedicate a portion of our efforts and funds to change this matter but it would not be cheap and without effort."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.1.a: "We will accept this petition."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.1.b: "We cannot spare efforts."
 
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.2.t: "Reorganization of the Dutch Church"
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.2.d: "[PAP.Monarch.GetName] has finally announced a much anticipated reformation of the church in the Netherlands. For decades, the amount of bishops and archbishops in the region was far too low for its population and it was having an impact on the clerical power. With the new papal bull, several new archbishoprics have been created and it seems like the future shines bright. But is it not too little too late to prevent the spread of heresy in the region? Only time will tell."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.2.a: "Finally!"
 
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.3.t: "David of Burgundy"
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.3.d: "David, illegitimate son of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a perfect fit for our little diplomatic game. The Bishopric of Utrecht has recently appointed a new bishop, and with a little puppet play in the curia, we could have David appointed as the bishop by the Pope himself. Though such meddling would not earn us the respect of the Utrechtian decision-makers. Too bad for them, they do not get a choice in the matter and will not make decisions for much longer either way. That being said, if we do press this play, we will need to be ready to back David's claim with our military if necessary."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.3.a: "Utilize our papal connections to appoint him as a bishop."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.3.b: "Let our troops face them head on."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.3.c: "Back off with the claims."
 
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.4.t: "Burgundian Intervention"
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.4.d: "Due to [From.GetAdjective] in the curia, the pope has decided to appoint a Burgundian puppet - David - as the new bishop of [Root.GetName]. It cannot be disputed that the Papal Authority is absolute but it also cannot be omitted that this is an obvious case of filthy diplomacy and unfair meddling in our affairs by a greater power."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.4.a: "Papal Authority is ultimate."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.4.b: "The Pope is corrupt! We will not obey such orders!"
 
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.5.t: "The Fields of Friesland"
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.5.d: "With the Frisian Freedom at its end, it is time to decide what will happen to the fields that the peasants used to plow back in Friesland. As it befits a feudal country, we could have the much of the lands granted to our distinguished noblemen, who have served to subdue this vile rabble, or we can let the peasants keep them for themselves."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.5.a: "Grant them to the [Root.GetNobilityName]."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.5.b: "Let the peasants keep them."
 
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.6.t: "Historia Batavica"
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.6.d: "Gerardus Geldenhouwer has just published his brand new work that concerns the history of Gelre and the Low Countries as a whole. In the work that he entitled 'Historia Batavica' he exclaims that the Dutch are descended from the ancient Batavians who have bravely resisted the Roman rule. How did we not make that connection earlier? He is truly a great scholar and shall be duly rewarded for his efforts."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.6.a: "Truly, we are Batavians!"
 
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.7.t: "Intrigue in Gelders"
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.7.d: "The court of [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty] is an ever-changing one. Courtly intrigues and father-son conflicts are not new. This is best exemplified by the conflicts between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Heir.GetName], whereas the two have been embroiled in a struggle for the throne, backed by the Burgundian factions. To guarantee the continuous rule over the duchy, perhaps we could offer the rights to the duchy for a guarantee of no meddling in the affairs." #talk about how arnold and adolf tried to imprison each other etc. Finally, the choice to sell the duchy
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.7.a: "Sell the Duchy to guarantee our rule."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.7.b: "We will not bow to Burgundian will!"
 
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.8.t: "Offer from [From.GetName]"
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.8.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] have given us an offer to purchase the rights to their duchy at an ample price. Though the land may not be worth the investment, it must be said that a regular subjugation of the territory would result in diplomatic troubles and the integration would be a challenge for sure."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.8.a: "Acquire the rights to the duchy."
 ME_Gelre_Utrecht_Events.8.b: "Not happening!"
