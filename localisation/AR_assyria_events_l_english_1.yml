 ar_asy_events.1.t: "The Subjugation of the Israelites"
 ar_asy_events.1.d: "The conquest of Israel, and thus her people, has concluded. With these conquests comes unruly resistance, and we must manage the populations with care to avoid uprisings.\nFor this reason, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has ordered local police forces to be appointed to manage amongst themselves. This should result in not only less resistance to occupation, but enable Assur to enforce our wills on the peoples of the region.\n\nThe great temples of Jerusalem shall be rebuilt and shall remain true to their purpose, with Assur's blessings. Henceforth, the Holy City of Jerusalem shall be maintained by Assur, and the benefits experienced as such."
 ar_asy_events.1.a: "The God of Israel shall be respected."
 
 ar_asy_events.2.t: "The Hanging Gardens of Babylon"
 ar_asy_events.2.d: "The fabled Hanging Gardens, regarded as one of the lost 'Wonders of the World,' shall be commissioned for Assur in Babylon, the supposed home to the original.\nOur prestige shall swell, and kings and queens from abroad shall come to visit us in hopes of seeing the Great Gardens, or perhaps the beautiful cities of Assur or Nineveh.\nRegardless, this great project shall bring honor to the lands of Assur and those who represent it."
 ar_asy_events.2.a: "Babylon shall be made great again!"
 ar_asy_events.2.b: "Let's not chase old spectres of glory."
 
 ar_asy_events.3.t: "The Ancient City of Assur"
 ar_asy_events.3.d: "The first step in reclaiming the legacy of Assur is to rebuild the namesake city of her empire. With sufficient development and infrastructure established, the populations of the city can rest easy knowing that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the great [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall do what is necessary to encourage further growth of development and production within the walls of Assur."
 ar_asy_events.3.a: "A great lost city, reclaimed!"
 
 ar_asy_events.4.t: "The Question of Faith"
 ar_asy_events.4.d: "For years, the religious identity of the population of Assur has been in question, with many unsure of their true beliefs. The religion of the Assyrians of antiquity has since been lost to the anals of history, with very little existing of it in written record.\n\nHowever, the teachings of Zoroaster remain in the region, with many local populations associating more with Ahura Mazda as their chief diety. The original Ashur has been forgotten, but Ahura Mazda reminds our old souls of what once was..\n\nShall we embrace Ahura Mazda as the Ashur, or shall we remain true to the official faith of the [Root.GovernmentName] and enforce [Root.Religion.GetName] upon our people?"
 ar_asy_events.4.a: "Zoraster was our prophet, may his words resonate!"
 ar_asy_events.4.b: "The heathens of Ahura Mazda shall soon understand.."
