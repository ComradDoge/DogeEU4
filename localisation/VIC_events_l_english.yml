 vic_prices.EVTDESC1:0 "The change from wood to iron came because the introduction of steam power required new techniques and experience in shipbuilding. The general use of iron for warships awaited the full realization of the value of the shell gun and the resulting need for armour, which were first demonstrated in the employment of armoured batteries in the Crimean War and in the battle between the Monitor and Merrimack in the American Civil War."

While coal demand increased even further, the early 19th century also marked the beginning of the the new Iron Age, as the iron industry experienced a massive stimulation from the heavy demand for railways, which needed iron rails, iron in the stock, bridges, tunnels and more. Meanwhile, civilian use increased, as everything which could be made of iron began to be."

Coal was cheaper and much more efficient than wood fuel in most steam engines and though the small-scale techniques were unsuited to the increasing demand, extraction moved away from surface extraction to deep shaft mining as the Industrial Revolution progressed."

In its simplest form, vulcanization is brought about by heating rubber with sulfur."

Newton's natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic proof with the mechanics of physical observation, yielding a coherent system of verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and inspired truth. Applied to public life, this approach yielded several successful campaigns for changes in social policy.           §R(Social Reforms are now activated)§!"

 vic_flavor_eng.12.t:0 "Young Ireland"
 vic_flavor_eng.12.d:0 "While Irish independence was not achieved until the early twentieth century, the idea of an independent Ireland has persisted for as long as its people have. Following a failure on behalf of the British government to address the horrid conditions on the isle from the Potato Famine, the Irish began to push for greater autonomy. Modern independence movements emerged around this time, with a political party Young Ireland, forming in 1846. The group attempted to rebel against the English crown, but to no avail."

 vic_flavor_hab.1.t:0 "Prince Midnight"
 vic_flavor_hab.1.d:0 "Engineer of the Austrian peace with Napoleon I through the Emperor’s marriage with Marie Louise and the conductor of the Concert of Europe, Klemens von Metternich was the dominant statesman of Austria from 1814 until he fled from Vienna in 1848. As Chancellor of State from 1821 to 1848, von Metternich (affectionately known as Fürst Mitternacht) conducted a strict policy of repression across Austria and the German Confederation against anything liberal or nationalistic. Whole heartedly set in the pre-Napoleonic mindset, von Metternich and his associates became the icon of conservatism during the first half of the nineteenth century until the revolutions of 1848 forced the prince to flee Vienna disguised as an old woman."

 vic_africa.2.d:0 "For centuries tropical diseases have kept explorers and colonists away from the Heart of Africa. In the middle of the 19th century however, advances in transportation, comunication and especially medicines for these tropical diseases are beginning to open up the continent for a new wave of exploration. With the development and usage of quinine as a treatment for malaria Africa will soon cease to be known as the white man's grave."
