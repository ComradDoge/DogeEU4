 EE_spa_centralization_desc:0 "The factions that have formed with the regency of Juan II have influenced our politics for far too long. Many great men had attempted to stop them, like Alvaro de Luna, but were ultimately unsuccessful. For this madness to finally stop, we must step up as a proper leader and rein in those who dare go against the will of the Crown."

 EE_spa_merchants_title:0 "Bourgeoisie Administration"
 EE_spa_merchants_desc:0 "We cannot rely on the outdated module of the nobility to run this country.

We must replace them, allowing the bourgeoisie to instead administrate the country more properly."

 EE_spa_fleet_desc:0 "We may not have a legacy of seafaring in the Mediterranean, but the rising Eastern threats have shaken Christendom to its core.

 EE_spa_legacy_of_rome_desc:0 "With the Byzantine Empire gone, some of its remnants have taken refuge in our nation. They speak of their dreams to reclaim their lost nation, which once stood atop the world.

 EE_spa_new_granada_desc:0 "The tales of the Continent of gold and riches have interested many settlers and conquistadors.

We shall name this land 'New Granada', to honor the last Muslim nation that resisted us in Iberia."

 EE_spa_incas_title:0 "Legacy of the Incans"
 EE_spa_incas_desc:0 "The lands of the Incans are filled with gold. Some of our Conquistadors even claim that their streets are paved in silver, and their jewelry made out of unknown metals. Of course, some of these accounts are exaggerated, but that does not stop our people from believing it. We can use these tales to encourage our Conquistadors to conquer these lands."

 EE_spa_america_gold_title:0 "American Cities"
 EE_spa_america_gold_desc:0 "Our role so far in the Americas has been that of conquerors. Pillaging every wealthy city along the way.

 EE_spa_trade_fleet_title:0 "Constructing a Trade Fleet"
 EE_spa_trade_fleet_desc:0 "With our [Root.GovernmentName] reaching every corner of the world, many of our merchants overseas are left without much aid.

 EE_spa_tercios_title:0 "Founding the Tercios"
 EE_spa_tercios_desc:0 "With Pike and Shot introduced into warfare, many in our armies have begun using this new tactic to great results. Eager by this success, our generals make ready for war. Others though are starting to theorize more. By creating professional units in our army, specialized fighting in these formations, we can maybe dominate the European battlefield for centuries to come."

 EE_spa_guerilla_tactics_desc:0 "Our armies may have proven to be effective at wartime, but in the wake of an Iberian invasion, our people must be ready to defend their homeland as well.

 EE_spa_iberian_identity_title:0 "Strengthen the Iberians"
 EE_spa_iberian_identity_desc:0 "The people of Iberia have always been a melting pot of different ethnicities. From the devout Galicians to the North, to the Moriscos in the South, to the Catalans to the East, their traditions do not match one another. If we promote religious beliefs to all of them though, we may manage to create an identity for the people of Iberia."

 EE_spa_merinos_title:0 "The Merinos"
 EE_spa_merinos_desc:0 "Merino Wool is perhaps some of the most famous wool in Europe. It is soft, and its breeds are strictly prohibited from leaving Iberia, with the death penalty for anyone who attempts to export them. For that reason, it is very expensive for foreigners to buy it, but at the same time, they are very profitable for their owners. We should try to monopolize on its income to further strengthen our coffers."

 EE_spa_mestra_title:0 "Strengthen the Mesta"
 EE_spa_mestra_desc:0 "The Mesta is a powerful association that protects the owners of livestock. It allowed them to freely move in the Crown of Castile.

 EE_spa_succession_desc:0 "Juan II has allowed for the factionalism amongst the nobility in [Root.GetName]. That, combined with the fact that Enrique IV of Castile is not a capable ruler has led to a disputed succession, where both Portugal and Aragon are vying over who will gain most favors with our nobility. We must take a side as well, choosing which of the two candidates we can support for a future union."

 EE_spa_heir_title:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName]'s Education"
 EE_spa_heir_desc:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] of [Root.GetName] did not have the greatest of upbringings. Often secluded away from crown affairs, and without the chance to get any proper education on how to administrate even a city, he is seen as incompetent and a weakling by the majority of the nobles. This has led to some of them even trying to get on his good side for when he becomes ruler of [Root.GetName]. We must act upon this before the situation gets worse."

 EE_spa_police_title:0 "La Santa Hermandad"
 EE_spa_police_desc:0 "The 'La Santa Hermandad', or the 'Holy Brotherhood', is a military peacekeeping association in Iberia which formed as early as the 13th century by towns wishing to protect themselves from potential Muslim rebels.

 EE_spa_spain_title:0 "Rey de Espana"

 EE_spa_jerusalem_desc:0 "When the Popes in the 11th century called a Crusade against the rising threat of Islam, Christendom answered, and it reclaimed Jerusalem. After the Crusades though, Europe was busy fighting each other, ignoring what was truly Holy, and Jerusalem once again fell to the Saracens. Now with the decline of the Muslims, we must once again reclaim Jerusalem. Deus Vult!"

 EE_spa_encomieda_system_title:0 "Fate of the Encomiendas"

Many conquerors had established their dynasties as a result of them, but with the Muslim threat out of Iberia, we must finally decide the fate of this system. We cannot allow the local governors to have complete power over their labor, exploiting the non-Christian populace, but at the same time it encourages others to set out and conquer in the name of the crown."

 ME_Castile_Events.1.t:0 "The Struggle for Iberia"
 ME_Castile_Events.1.d:0 "The Battle of Rio Salado had secured Christian hegemony over Iberia, pushing the remnants of Andalusia to the walls of Granada. Unfortunately, though, there is no opportunity to achieve a complete victory over them, as they remain under the protection of the Berbers in North Africa.\n\nThe people of Granada now stand as a tributary to our nation, but we stand divided thanks to internal politics.\n\nThe Infantes of Aragon, influential relatives of Juan II, seek to only expand their domains, disregarding the interests of the crown. Alvaro de Luna, Castile's grandee, Grandmaster of the Knights of Santiago, and Juan II's champion has created a coalition of many lesser nobles and burghers to defend the crown from the Infantes. This has put Castile in a position close to a civil war.\n\nWhat's worse is that the king's heir, Enrique de Trastamara, has shown no interest in governing the country, and is secluded in Castile's court, away from any dynastic politics. Should such an heir ascend to the throne without any experience, Castile is surely to plunge into civil war."
 ME_Castile_Events.1.a:0 "Whatever the cost, we will reconquer Iberia from the Muslims."

Many believe a union of those crowns is possible if the right circumstances appear. However, many of our higher nobles, disgruntled and rebellious, aligned with the de Avis dynasty in Portugal.\n\nThe situation is starting to look much like the one during the Castilian Civil War of the 14th century, with the higher nobility supporting a foreigner and their claim to the throne. Unlike last time, however, it is entirely possible to keep the conflict contained to Iberia or even prevent the whole crisis by choosing a side to align ourselves with."

 ME_Castile_Events.3.d: "Enrique IV of Castile, ever since a young age, has shown to be disinterested in the politics of Castile, often neglecting his duties as heir for his selfish pursuits. He often secludes himself in court while ignoring the forming sides emerging, ready to plunge the realm into Civil War. If he is to rule Castile with this mindset, only conflict and death will certainly follow after.\n\nFor those reasons, we have only two choices: educate him, or assassinate him.\n\nAn assassination would be the easiest and most effective way to deal with this problem. Our house has plenty of other candidates to place as heirs. However, this has the risk of discovery. Should we assassinate a relative and be found out, it is clear that we will face internal and external problems.\n\nOur other option is to educate him in the ways of rulership, shaping him to be a proper Monarch. It will need many resources, great men, and even a bit of risk, but it is possible to be achieved."

 ME_Castile_Events.4.t: "The Requests of the Nobility"
 ME_Castile_Events.4.d: "The nobles of our kingdom have been in an almost constant state of rebellion ever since Pedro I the Cruel of the Ivrea dynasty and his bastard brother Enrique II the Fratricidal of the Trastámara dynasty fought in the First Castilian Civil War. Influenced by the situation in the Hundred Years' War, our debts and a poor administration in protecting the king's central authority, the interests of the kingdom lost importance in favor of the regional ambitions of the nobility. Our legitimacy was challenged by the immense privileges of the nobles, who until recently were the most important estate in managing the affairs of the crown, and were responsible for major revolts whenever our predecessors tried to curtail their influence in our realm. It was impossible to rule without the nobles' approval of our ambitions, which often involved the need for bribes or many more privileges, which only made the situation worse. Kings such as Juan II and Enrique IV have clumsily tried to control the weight of the nobles over our kingdom, but in vain they only achieved animosity towards the central institutions of Castilian government. Respect for our sovereignty has been lost and we must change our strategy, as direct conflict against such an influential estate has not at all resulted in a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nThe influence of the infantes and nobles throughout the lordships of our kingdom seems to be not only a problem, but part of the solution. So far, the only thing that has succeeded in holding them together despite their ambitions has been the attempts of the central power to formulate an authoritarian and centralized kingdom. We may simply have to take advantage of the internal divisions, conflicts of interest and rivalries among the nobles, but if we play our cards right we can weaken the nobility sufficiently through attrition among the various feudal lords of our realm. Our vain efforts to control the nobility have not turned out as we had hoped, but if we can make the nobility weaken themselves, through our interest in the politics and intrigues of the nobility, we may be able to exploit their division to win the favor of the loyalists and control our opponents. In other words, the division of a class once united by our ambitions is now crucial to us precisely to make our interests a future reality. The future of our kingdom, our authority, will have as its foundation the division of our opponents.\n\nJust as the Persians under Artaxerxes I recognized that it would not be the sheer force that would conquer the indomitable peoples of the Hellas, fomenting conflict between the polis during the Peloponnesian Wars to impose their influence on the region, it will not be a war that will conquer the nobility, but intrigue and the favor of our monarchs over the interests of the regional nobles. The pen is stronger than the sword." 
 ME_Castile_Events.4.a: "Divide et Impera"

 ME_Castile_Events.5.t: "Tax Relief to the Nobility"
 ME_Castile_Events.5.d: "Our efforts to show an interest in the affairs of the nobility have led to the nobles raising their concerns to the royal court. The crown's relentless taxation of its privileges has led to an impoverishment that worries the lords of our realm, who have been forced into debt in order to pursue their political ambitions. If we were allowed to pay their debts through the crown treasury, perhaps we could curry favour with some of the nobles and make them more loyal and open to our intentions to reinforce royal authority.The advisors of our kingdom appreciate that, if we involve the crown in their issues, we would have a great opportunity to develop our state policy without too much opposition."
 ME_Castile_Events.5.a: "If that is their only request..."
 ME_Castile_Events.5.b: "Tax privileges? We would be sending the wrong message!"

 ME_Castile_Events.6.t: "Factionalism in the Nobility"
 ME_Castile_Events.6.d: "The factionalism between the nobles requires our attention if we wish to become involved in the political affairs of this estate, as there is currently a conflict of interests between the high nobility and the low nobility. Abuses by the more powerful aristocrats of our realm have endangered the small landowners, feudal lords who see their privileges and possessions threatened by the ambitions of larger political actors. While it is undeniable that the high nobility is the heart of our realm, supporting the small nobles could help us to take away the privileges that our predecessors ceded to the most important lords of our kingdom. A weak nobility is a controlled nobility, although we could also gain great benefits from strengthening the core of state power. On the other hand, moving away from this issue could free us from any responsibility of ending up reinforcing factionalism, something certainly undesirable according to our ambitions to centralise the kingdom..."
 ME_Castile_Events.6.a: "We will side with the lower nobles"
 ME_Castile_Events.6.b: "The higher nobility is the core of the crown"
 ME_Castile_Events.6.c: "Promoting factionalism by siding with one faction is not the solution"

 ME_Castile_Events.7.t: "Investing in the Cortes"
 ME_Castile_Events.7.d: "The institutional organisms of regional representation, the Cortes, are an integral part of our kingdom through which the different estates convey their concerns to our monarch, who has not the obligation, but perhaps the responsibility, to act according to some of the major concerns of his serfs.\n\nThe Cortes of León, held in 1188 at the beginning of the reign of Alfonso IX, are part of the legacy of our crown, with their testimony being the oldest document of parliamentarism. This institution would influence other kingdoms in Europe as an assembly to curtail not only the power of the king but also to swear an oath of total submission to the monarchy, even if at the same time the kings and queens of the realm had the responsibility to take on the issues of his serfs and to listen at their needs. In other words, each estate had its concerns and the king had to listen and study what to do around them, even if some issues had more meaning according to the philosophy of each king, he generally acted according to the common needs of the time.\n\nThe origin of this institution stems from the claims of the Reconquista, as a way of obtaining popular support and economic funds for the crown's ambitions. Within the different kingdoms that make up the Kingdom of Castile, similar institutions form part of the political structures of each region, although the factionalism of the nobility and the civil wars have considerably weakened the different Cortes of our kingdom. If we were to invest part of the treasury funds to finance the reconstruction of these institutions, there is no doubt that we would gain not only the favor of the nobility, but also some respect from those who question our authority, and could therefore gain more popular support for our ideological pretensions and ambitions."

Clearly to hide from an inevitable fate, written from the moment the Christians crossed Sierra Morena and settled in the basin of the Guadalquivir.\n\nThe instability of the kingdom to which they paid tribute has allowed them to remain practically intact since the treaty that ratified their vassalage to the crown of Castile, so they have not hesitated to find an opportunity to go beyond its borders and lay siege to the city of Algeciras. Such a defiance cannot be ignored, many nobles and court advisors have declared that it is time to wipe out the last strongholds of Al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula. Our army and our fleet are now marching south to finally restore that kingdom that Rodrigo lost in that distant 711, god keep us in this last crusade."

After the two-month deadline offered by the kings of Spain, the last Andalusian king left the city with his court, his wife and his mother, the Sultana Aixa, who, on seeing the young emir weeping as he contemplated the last views of the Alhambra that his eyes could see, declared coldly \"cry like a woman, what you did not know how to defend like a man.\"\n\nThe kings of Castile entered a culturally enriching city, where both Jews and Muslims coexisted with Mozarabic Christians under the right of dhimmi, a thriving commercial city that sheltered the last remnants of Al-Andalus. The Moorish population did not react particularly well to the surrender of their unappreciated monarch, rebelling several times in violent protests that had to be pacified by both the sultan and the Castilian troops. With the city in our hands, the Reconquista is over, but we must now decide what to do with the diverse population of the kingdom of Granada, now part of the Golden Crown of Castile. On the one hand, we can be tolerant of the population, avoiding trouble while we try to culturalise the region and Christianise it by peaceful means, although other advisors suggest that an inquisitorial religious policy will nip any hint of rebellion in the bud."

One after another, they all failed, not only due to the naval supremacy of the Maghreb kingdoms but also due to the limited logistical capacity committed to such a conquest.\n\nNow that the Sultan of Morocco has been defeated, we must decide what to do with this newly conquered territory. Although we can administer it directly, we should not rule out the idea of creating a powerful regional puppet to ensure control of the area without sacrificing too much effort. In this way, we can dedicate ourselves more to continental politics. At the same time, promoting the establishment of a crusader kingdom in North Africa can serve to satisfy the religious fervor still implanted in our society.

Legends say that he discovered a race of giant and indomitable humans, who take refuge in the jungles south of the desert.

However, his pro-European policy distanced him from national politics, neglecting the Crown of Castile to the point of provoking numerous revolts that proclaimed his mother Juana, the last of the Trastámara dynasty, as queen due to her son's abandonment of Castilian interests.\n\nHis poor knowledge of Spanish did not help his cause at all, as did his intention to surround his court with foreign Flemish humanists who had little or no understanding of the reality of the kingdom. Although he was an authentic king of the Renaissance, his ambitions gave rise to a gradual neglect of Iberian institutions in favor of an aggressive policy in Europe against the imperial princes related to the increasingly popular Lutheranism and against the King of France, who maintained a historic rivalry that almost led them to fight in a duel that was avoided at the last minute by their wives.\n\nA Habsburg on the Spanish throne is an undoubted opportunity to extend the influence of our kingdom in Europe, although at the same time, it can lead to us being forced to intervene politically in matters that do not seem to interest the people of Spain."

It has left Granada in a precarious position, forced into the defensive rather than leading campaigns against the Christian Kings that now hold what was once Andalusian. Muhammad IX understands it too well and is a Tributary in all but name to the Castilians. The once great realm of Andalusia is now reduced to mere ruin, with the court in Granada as its only shadow in Iberia.\n\nNot all hope is lost however. A campaign in the Kingdom of Murcia may not be viable currently, but the Castilians are preoccupied with their conflicts. Juan II is but a puppet to the Grandmaster of the Knights Santiago, and the nobility is busy with infighting. His son as well, Enrique IV has shown little interest in dynastic politics. We may not be able to defeat them united, but we must instead divide and conquer them.\n\nMany Sultans, primarily those in North Africa, wish for the remnants of Andalusia to not be extinguished by the crusader kings of Iberia and will support us in a war. Whilst we cannot use that as an excuse to get them to join us for now, it will be one of our shields against the upcoming storm.\n"

 ME_Castile_Events.32.t: "Fall of the Incas"
 ME_Castile_Events.32.d: "A centralized empire with a complex social and administrative structure, rich in precious metals, was established on the high plateaus of the Andes. Driven by glory and gold fever, our conquerors advanced into the Inca lands in a violent military campaign that ended with the capture of the emperor. Now that he has lost all authority, we must decide what to do with him and the territories we have conquered. We must give special priority to the idea of Christianising the inhabitants of the region. Our explorers have given it the name of Peru, a rich and exotic land, distant from anything that a man of the old world had witnessed before. Such is the splendor that shines in this country that its very name has become a symbol of the gold that its temples, palaces and other monuments hold.\n\nTo tell the truth, we have not been particularly gentle in the conquest, bloody in itself, but the fanaticism and ambition born of the idea of proclaiming a new Reconquista has led to real barbarities being done in the name of God, even in a region which had known but little conflict between the various states that had been formed there. What our soldiers have not killed during the campaign has been ravaged by disease, for the natives had so far known neither plague nor smallpox, now symbols of inhumanity. Whether intentional or not, the conquerors have unleashed a genuine nightmare that will prevail in the form of a legend which, if it spreads beyond these lands, could undoubtedly cause a problem for our impeccable image of Christian morality in European politics. Likewise, we must not forget that the natives are still feudatories of our crown, so our administration must focus on rebuilding the desolate infrastructure and repairing relations between our peoples so that our sovereignty is accepted. In this task, religion has a vital role to play, for we must not only conquer their lands but also their hearts, for which the word of Jesus is essential. Missionaries in the form of friars set sail from the old world to spread it into the new world, daring to penetrate where our influence does not yet even extend. In the end, it will not only be the sword, but the sacred writings of the book that will assert our sovereignty in Peru.\n\nWe cannot underestimate that, the emperor being in our hands and in perfect health, we could perhaps take advantage of his condition to set up a puppet to satisfy the people after a violent war. At the same time, it is undeniable that many Incas would accept Christianity more readily if one of their most important moral guides showed sympathy for the true faith. Assisted by suitable advisors, both lay and ecclesiastical, we could perhaps persuade him to remain loyal by certain conditions and privileges. This would make it impossible for us to take as much advantage as we could of his riches."

Likewise, on the coasts, our explorers have been able to find great abandoned cities that still display some of the splendor they undoubtedly enjoyed in their golden age. We must therefore realise that there is an empire hidden in the depths of the new world, as well as an advanced culture that has left its mark on history. Perhaps the wisest thing to do would be to prepare an approach and study the foundations of their civilization to mount a potential campaign of conquest and appropriate their riches. If the legends we have heard are true, it is more than evident that we have an opportunity to alleviate the remarkable shortage of gold that has caused the bullion famine that Europe has experienced over the last century."

 ME_Castile_Events.34.d: "Our conquistadors have managed to defeat the Aztec empire using clever diplomacy, using local resentment towards their oppressors to guarantee a victory in the city of Tenochtitlan, now conquered in the name of the king of Spain. Despite their numerical superiority, the use of gunpowder together with the support of the rival or tributary natives of the Mexica people allowed us to put an early end to this brief but violent war in which not only fire, but also disease, took numerous human lives. Now, it is the hegemony of the Spanish Empire that declares its sovereignty in the name of the crown. Our former allies are now vassals of our kingdom, appeased both by force and by gifts and bribes. We are doing an excellent job integrating the territories into a new administration, in the form of a Viceroyalty. A new future looms over a land formerly bathed in blood, now conquered in the name of our lord. Just as Christianity is gradually spreading in these lands, cultural symbols have lost their original value, although the attachment to the traditions that our new vassals, natives of the new world, preserve is undeniable. We must therefore decide how we will approach our vassals in the Indies.\n\nThe truth is that although the Viceroyalty we have founded must be built on the tolerance demanded by theologians such as Bartolomé de las Casas, we cannot ignore the tensions between the nobility that has begun to establish itself in these new lands and the locals. At the same time, it is prudent to recognize that it would be of significant benefit if we were to loot these ancient places of worship and the palaces attributed to the ancient kingdom that ruled these lands. After all, it is we who now impose sovereignty in what we have renamed New Spain, the gesture could provoke hostilities but it could also allow us to send a strong message: We are now the ones in charge. The feathered serpent is but a false god overshadowed by the glory of Christ and it will be the gold dedicated to its imposing monuments and delicate craftsmanship that will finance the flourishing of the churches and universities of the new world. Let us use their monuments for the glory of God or destroy them and bury their remains like their old heathen faith, but only by changing the meaning of their culture and traditions can we truly assimilate them as subjects of the crown.\n\nWhat is clear is that now that we have completed the conquest, we must prepare an administration for perpetual peace between the once warring peoples and the settlers who have decided to venture into this land of opportunity. To do this, we must contemplate whether the word of God is enough to conquer souls or whether it is wiser to destroy a legacy they may cling to rebel against our evangelizing mission.\n\nTolerance is wise, but also naive, so we must consider how best to make our sovereignty of these lands an undisputed issue."

He then traveled to Rome, where he was influenced by the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, and later settled in Toledo, Spain, in 1577.\n\nIn Spain, El Greco gained patronage from the Catholic Church and the Spanish aristocracy, and his style evolved to incorporate elements of Mannerism and Baroque art.

 ME_Castile_Events.45.t: "Concejo de la Mesta"
 ME_Castile_Events.45.d: "The Concejo de la Mesta was created in 1273 by Alfonso X the Wise, bringing together all the shepherds of the Kingdom of Castile and León in an Iberian association, granting them important prerogatives and privileges that exempted them from military service and from having to testify in trials, as well as rights of passage and grazing. Even before that, the herdsmen met in assemblies called \"mestas\" which refers to the heterogeneous nature of these groupings that came from different localities and met two to three times a year to do business, deal with economic matters and distinguish the Mestencos, a word referring to the animals without owners that might have been mixed.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages other royal privileges were added to the Mesta, as well as a special control to protect it from farmers. This guild was not only one of the most important in Europe, but it was also the first guild of livestock farmers, although there had previously been corporations of livestock farmers in Aragon.\n\nThe Mesta controls the monopoly on the export of Merino wool, valued for its curliness, thinness and softness and sheared from a breed of sheep native to North Africa, which has now become an important export product competing in the great European markets of Flanders and the Campaign, where the great trade fairs are held. This sheep breed is highly valued, so if we maintain these monopolies and privileges we may enjoy great benefits in our lands in the form of a development and flourishing of rural life, as well as a revolution in the production of wool to service the demand of our customers."

 ME_Castile_Events.46.d: "The Laws of Burgos, enacted on 27 December 1512, was a set of regulations designed to protect the Indigenous people from exploitation and abuse by the Castilian colonizers in the Americas. These laws were the first to recognize certain rights of the natives and to attempt to regulate the Encomienda system. The main provisions of the Laws of Burgos included labor conditions, quality of life, food, clothing, education, evangelization, protection of Indigenous families, regulation of punishments and, finally, a commitment to supervision to enforce each of these points to prevent abuses by the colonizers towards the native population. These laws find their precedent in the promise of Isabella I of Castile to treat the natives \"very well and with affection\", for they were to be free serfs of the crown and not enslaved as originally suggested by Christopher Columbus. It was her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon, who after his widowhood ratified her will employing a legislative code guaranteeing the dignity of the natives living in the New World.\n\nAlthough the Laws of Burgos represented an advance in the recognition of indigenous rights, their effective implementation was limited and, in many cases, not adequately enforced. Nevertheless, they set an important precedent for future legislation and debates on the treatment of indigenous peoples in the colonial context."

 ME_Castile_Events.48.d: "Alvaro de Luna served as Favourite of King John II of Castile as well as his Constable, a military position created during the 15th century that represented the king's highest representative in his absence. This nobleman, opposed to the factionalism of the Infantes of Aragon, sons of Fernando I of Aragon and Leonor de Alburquerque, had great influence in Castilian politics during the turbulent times of the Castilian Civil War. Opposed to the factionalist policy in the nobility promulgated by the brothers of Alfonso V, the eldest of the so-called Infantes, Alvaro de Luna accumulated great powers that culminated in an excessive ambition that finally led him to participate in numerous conspiracies to safeguard his privileged situation. Loyal only to his principles, we find ourselves in a difficult circumstance, for our beloved [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] has accused our most loyal advisor of being a participant in numerous intrigues and assassinations that make it difficult to continue to rely on him to reform the kingdom into a centralized and modern state.\n\nWe can hardly maintain his privileges and our confidence in him without lending to an unethical and unaesthetic situation concerning our kingdom, but since he's part of the Order of Santiago it might perhaps be prudent to take up his cause as part of our religious principles and thus gain the favor of the monastic orders established in the Iberian peninsula during the golden age of the Reconquista."

 ME_Castile_Events.50.t: "Future of the Encomienda System"
 ME_Castile_Events.50.d: "The Encomienda was the relationship of dependence between two free men, manifested in an exchange of benefits in which the strong gave protection to the weak in exchange for loyalty and the provision of certain services. This became a submission of the weak to their feudal lord, thus becoming a vassal.\n\nThis institution appeared in the Iberian Peninsula during feudalism at the time of the Reconquista, rewarding those who conquered lands with part of the work of certain groups of conquered people. In a way, it was a kind of tax. In theory, the workers were legally supposed to receive benefits from the conquerors for whom they worked. This not only encouraged repopulation but also created a feudal relationship that favored coexistence between conquerors and conquerors. However, now that our sovereignty extends throughout the Iberian peninsula, it makes no sense to maintain this institution from a certain perspective.\n\nPerhaps it would be a good idea, now that our influence is inevitably expanding across the sea, to establish the Encomienda system in the colonies to manage the feudatory relationship resulting from the conquest of the New World. In any case, while abolishing them would bring us some benefit, we cannot deny the possibility of implementing them in the Viceroyalties to encourage the expansion of our influence and to ensure that the natives are responsible for their new status as vassals of the crown."

A virgin and unexplored land, populated by exotic animals and abundant in all kinds of spices, the shortage of which has been felt since the Turkish threat banned trade across the Bosphorus. However, the discovery of something so desirable was not the greatest virtue the new world had to offer, but the gold deposits found on the islands and much more common even on the vast mainland.\n\nThe natives, who enjoy gold in abundance, do not find much value in this precious metal, which has been perfect for us to take advantage of their naivety. From the Taino peoples of the Caribbean to the Mayans inhabiting the Yucatan, American gold is not only plundered from those who do not know how to value it for what it is, a real treasure innocently destined for trinkets and religious idols. We melt down in massive quantities what were once symbols of heathen practices, forging the coins of the New World. The fertile and rich soil is the site of great mines, where the same natives who once worshipped golden icons now work to keep the exports of precious metals to the Iberian peninsula at full capacity. Notable among these are the Cerro del Potosí and the Valle del Cauco mines in Peru and New Granada respectively. The market has been revolutionized by the ingots and riches that sail every month from the new world, expanding our treasury.\n\nAt the same time, however, this gradual increase in our gold reserves has caused the standard of living of the common people to become more austere, due to the inevitable economic repercussions of such a singular enrichment of the state coffers."

He was the grandson of Maximilian of Habsburg, of Mary of Burgundy and, finally, of those who dynastically united the Iberian peninsula into one crown, Isabella and Ferdinand, the Catholic Monarchs. He inherited the Crown of Castile, the Crown of Aragon, the Kingdom of Navarre, the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily, the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Austrian Archduchy, Flanders, almost all the Netherlands except Friesland, Franche-Comté, the feudal claims of the Duchy of Burgundy and the territories of the West Indies ratified in the Treaty of Tordesillas. From his maternal grandparents, at the same time, he inherited the titles that Andrew Palaeologus, the last emperor of Byzantium \"de iure\", sold to them before his death. Uniquely, when he was elected king of the Romans, it was the first and only time since the Coronation of Charlemagne that the titles of the crown of the East and the crown of the West were united in a single individual.

They would not suspect a thing, as to everyone it is clear that a hunting accident had just happened."

 ME_Castile_Events.60.d: "Hernán Cortés, born around 1485 in Medellín, Spain, rose to prominence as the conqueror of the Aztec Empire in the early 16th century. Known for his daring and ambitious spirit, Cortés led an expedition to Mexico in 1519, defying orders from the Spanish authorities. Through alliances with indigenous groups and military prowess, he overthrew the Aztec Empire under Emperor Moctezuma II by 1521. Cortés's conquest drastically altered the course of history, marking the beginning of Spanish colonization in the Americas."

 ME_Castile_Events.61.d: "Francisco Pizarro, born around 1471 in Trujillo, Spain, became famous for his conquest of the Inca Empire in the early 16th century. Setting sail for South America in 1509, Pizarro undertook multiple expeditions before finally capturing the Inca emperor Atahualpa in 1532. This event led to the downfall of the Inca civilization and paved the way for Spanish dominance in the region. Pizarro's leadership and ruthlessness in battle earned him both admiration and criticism, as he navigated through political intrigues and conflicts within his ranks."

 ME_Castile_Events.62.t: "Ferdinand Magellan"
 ME_Castile_Events.62.d: "Ferdinand Magellan, born around 1480 in Portugal, was a pioneering explorer and navigator known for leading the first circumnavigation of the globe. In 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with a fleet of five ships on a quest to find a westward route to the Spice Islands. Despite numerous challenges, including mutinies and treacherous seas, he successfully navigated through the strait that now bears his name, allowing his expedition to enter the Pacific Ocean. Magellan's determination and vision led to the discovery of a vast ocean route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Although he did not complete the journey himself, dying in a skirmish in the Philippines in 1521, his expedition marked a monumental achievement in maritime history, significantly expanding Europe's understanding of the world."

 ME_Castile_Events.63.a: "Oh no."

 ME_Castile_Events.64.t: "Increase of Firepower"
 ME_Castile_Events.64.d: "Mobile artillery and better guns have led to formations using more and more firepower, with the pikes being primarily a force to keep cavalry at bay, our pike-heavy formation has had difficulties navigating the battlefield without many casualties. Perhaps we should get rid of this formation..."
 ME_Castile_Events.64.a: "Get rid of it? But it served [Root.GetName] well."

 ME_Castile_Events.65.t: "Rise of Line Infantry"
 ME_Castile_Events.65.d: "Instead of mixing pikes and guns in the same formation, recent technologies have allowed infantry to perform both tasks without needing to mix these weapons. The line infantry, making each soldier carry both a musket and a bayonet for close-quarters combat, has led to the absolute decline for the Tercios rendering them useless."
 ME_Castile_Events.65.a: "Maybe we should reform..."
 
 ME_Castile_Events.66.t: "The Most Noble Don Quixote de la Mancha"
 ME_Castile_Events.66.d: "\"Don Quixote\" is a novel written by Miguel de Cervantes and published in two parts in 1605 and 1615. It tells the story of Alonso Quixano, an elderly gentleman who becomes obsessed with chivalric romances and decides to become a knight-errant, renaming himself Don Quixote. Accompanied by his loyal squire, Sancho Panza, who serves as a comic foil, Don Quixote embarks on various adventures to revive chivalry and uphold justice. Throughout the novel, Don Quixote's idealism clashes with the realities of the world, often leading to humorous and poignant moments. Cervantes explores themes of illusion versus reality, the power of imagination, and the complexities of human nature, making \"Don Quixote\" a timeless masterpiece of literature."
