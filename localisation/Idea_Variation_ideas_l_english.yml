 confuci0: "Confucianism Ideas"
 confuci0_desc: "Our state religion is Confucianism."
 confuci1: "Zuo Tradition"
 confuci1_desc: "It comprises thirty densely written chapters covering a period from 722 to 468 BC, and focuses mainly on political, diplomatic, and military affairs from that era. The Zuo Zhuan is famous for its 'relentlessly realistic' style, and recounts many tense and dramatic episodes, such as battles and fights, royal assassinations and murder of concubines, deception and intrigue, excesses, citizens' oppression and insurgences, and appearances of ghosts and cosmic portents."
 confuci2: "The Gongyáng Zhuàn"
 confuci2_desc: "Gongyang Zhuan argues that Chunqiu is not merely a history, but a manifesto of Confucius' philosophy on his ideal regarding sociopolitical order. Unlike Zuo Zhuan, a later favorite among many scholars for its vivid narrative of historical events, Gongyang Zhuan was compiled in a dialogistic style resembling a class conversation between a Confucian scholar and his students."
 confuci3: "Guliang Zhuan"
 confuci3_desc: "Written in question and answer style, the work annotates the Spring and Autumn Annals covering the period between the first year of State of Lu ruler Duke Yin of Lu (722 BCE) and the fourteenth year of his later counterpart Duke Ai of Lu (481 BCE). Like the Gongyang Zhuan the Guliáng Zhuàn is written as a didactic explanation of the subtle political and social messages of the Spring and Autumn Annals rather than in the anecdotal style of the Zuo Zhuan. It is an important book for the study of the development of Confucianism from the Warring States Period through the Han Dynasty."
 confuci4: "Kongzi Jiayu"
 confuci4_desc: "In the postface to the Kongzi Jiayu, its author describes the collection as discussions Confucius had with his disciples and others, recorded by his disciples. Selected discussions were published as the Analects (Lunyu), while the rest was collected in the Jiayu. This characterization is consistent with the content of the Jiayu, which contains nearly all the Confucian lore found in such diverse ancient texts as the Zuozhuan, Guoyu, Mencius, Han Feizi, Book of Rites, Han Shi Waizhuan, Lüshi Chunqiu, Huainanzi, etc., except what is included in the Analects, the Classic of Filial Piety, and a few other works."
 confuci5: "I Ching"
 confuci5_desc: "The core of the I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text called the Changes of Zhou (Zhou yì). Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Based on a comparison of the language of the Zhou yi with dated bronze inscriptions, Edward Shaughnessy dated its compilation in its current form to the early decades of the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, in the last quarter of the 9th century BC."
 confuci6: "Erya"
 confuci6_desc: "The Erya has been described as a dictionary, glossary, synonymicon, thesaurus, and encyclopaedia. Karlgren (1931: 46) explains that the book 'is not a dictionary in abstracto, it is a collection of direct glosses to concrete passages in ancient texts.' The received text contains 2094 entries, covering about 4300 words, and a total of 13,113 characters. It is divided into nineteen sections, the first of which is subdivided into two parts."
 confuci7: "Mencius"
 confuci7_desc: "The Mencius comprises 7 chapters, each divided into two halves, with alternating short sayings and extensive dialogues on specific philosophical arguments. Its fundamental positions, such as Mencius' famous argument in chapter 6A that human nature is inherently good, are usually presented as conversations between Mencius and contemporaneous thinkers, while arguments on specific issues usually appear in records of his advice and counsel to various rulers."

 shinto5: "Susanoo-no-Mikoto"
 shinto5_desc: "Alternately romanized as Susano-o, Susa-no-o, and Susanowo. Reportedly called 'Futsushi'. He is the god of storms as well as in some cases the god of the sea. He is also somewhat of a trickster god, as Japanese mythology extensively documents the 'sibling rivalry' between him and Amaterasu. Susanoo also was responsible for the slaying of the monster Yamata no Orochi and the subsequent discovery of the sacred sword Kusanagi."
 shinto6: "Ame-no-Uzume"

 cathar0: "Cartharism Ideas"
 cathar0_desc: "Our state religion is Catharism."
 cathar1: "Women Equal To Me"
 cathar1_desc: "Catharism has been seen as giving women the greatest opportunities for independent action since women were found as being believers as well as Perfecti, who were able to administer the sacrament of the consolamentum. The Cathars believed that one would be repeatedly reincarnated until one commits to the self-denial of the material world, which meant that a man could be reincarnated as a woman and vice versa, thereby rendering gender completely meaningless."
 cathar2: "The Pure People"

 zoro1: "Saoshyant"
 zoro1_desc: "Literally meaning 'the one who brings benefit,' Saoshyant is a prominent figure in Zoroastrianism. Prophesied to bring salvation to humanity and renovation to the world, they will resurrect the dead and battle Angra Manyu in the final battle for this world. As we await his birth, we will make sure that people that follow him will be both worthy and ready in this final struggle."
 zoro2: "Avesta"
 zoro2_desc: "The holy book of Zoroastrianism, the very first avesta was unfortunately lost during the invasion of Alexander the Great. The book is divided into several parts and contains prayers, hymns, invocations and other important information about religion. We should make knowledge of Avesta mandatory, as only people who know are familiar with it can truly guide us"
 zoro3: "Invite Dasturs"
 zoro3_desc: "Dasturs were people with deep religious education. They were upholders and promulgators of the law, translators of the textes to a more simplified versions and judges in religious cases. We would greatly benefit by inviting such people in our court."
 zoro4: "Reform the Priesthood"
 zoro4_desc: "The priests, 'modebds' are the ones that serve in the temple. Since ancient times, these priests also held temples and were able to extert significant influence in politics or other state affairs. By reforming the priesthood by outlawing them all these privileges, we will ensure that the mobads will be ocuppied dealing with religious matters and will not try to engage in affairs of the state."
 zoro5: "The Holy Flame"
 zoro5_desc: "For centuries our people have endured - We witnessed as our own kind were converted, our houses destroyed and our temples were turned into rubble. As we rise once again, the followers of Angra Mainyu will surely come after us again. We must make sure that our people are ready and motivated - These flames will no longer be extinguished!"
 zoro6: "Religious Education"
 zoro6_desc: "Taking the first footstep with a good thought, the second with a good word and the third with a good deed, I entered Paradise - The prophets words have influenced lives of common people since ancient times. By bringing back religious education, we will make sure that people are well acquainted with the teachings, practises and important rules of Zoroastrianism."
 zoro7: "Trade and Religion"
 zoro7_desc: "One of the easiest ways of spreading religion was by trade. Merchants would also bring their ideas and religions with them in foreign countries and the countries that traded with each other also exchanged these two things without their 'official' approval."
 mane0: "Manichaeism Ideas"
 mane0_desc: "Our state religion is manichaeism."
 mane1: "Teachings of the prophet"
 mane1_desc: "Prophet Mani taught us that every religion was 'like a river, flowing towards a single, unified faith.' While the followers of other religions have misguided ways, they must not be surpressed and should be free to practise their own version of the true path."
 mane2: "72 Bishops"
 mane2_desc: "Appointed by Mani himself, 72 Bishops were to guide our people. These were mostly village elders, religious people and others that were known in their community as trustworthy successors of Prophet. Let us introduce and appoint these Bishops once again, so they might serve our people and spread the light in these dark times."
 mane3: "Let them see the light"
 mane3_desc: "Manichaeism as a religion was extremely flexible. One of the reasons why it was spread so videly and without much bloodshed was its ability to adopt target people's practises - culture, traditions and even religion. By 'assimilating' those practises, Manichaeism seemed more attractive and less alien, while it also encouraged people to convert."
 mane4: "Struggle in the Cosmos"
 mane4_desc: "The world is in a constant state of upheaval as forces or Darkness and Light battle to decide our fate. While we can do very little to influence those processes, we can make sure that our people are safe from evil forces that come in the form of our enemies by motivating and preparing them to defend themselves."
 mane5: "Ritual Music"
 mane5_desc: "Music was a respected practise in Manichaeism and was often used during rituals. It was considered to be an echo from the heavens, a sound that could purify the soul and make both player and listener closer to the light."
 mane6: "Re-unite the diaspora"
 mane6_desc: "Due to the extreme hostility, most of the manicheans were usually in hiding and never revealed their true faith, or in some cases they formed small village communities in desolate regions where central religious authority was not very strong. As we have established Manichaeism as a state religion, it would be a good idea to invite and settle all of our persecuted brothers and sisters in faith inside our country."
 mane7: "Construct a Grand Temple"
 mane7_desc: "Manicheans had two kinds of religious buildings - Temples and monasteries.
