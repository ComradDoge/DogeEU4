 ME_Cornwall_Events.1.t: "New Taxes & Stannary Discontent"
 ME_Cornwall_Events.1.d: "Recent wars and internal conflicts have drained the treasury. However, in those bleak times a glimmer of hope shines, as we suddenly remember the existence of our highly privileged tin miners in Cornwall! Indeed, the privileges granted to them allow them to get high profit margins from the tin mines they manage. In such case, perhaps it would be beneficial to place new taxes upon them.\n\nSo, we did. However, instead of cutting their profit margins, the taxes have trickled down onto the common miners of Cornwall, whose pay had been reduced to pay for our extra tariffs. The displeased miners and their families are now uppity, leading to a risk of rebellion."

Our nobles, always seeking splendor and prestige, have already begun claiming descent from those people, hoping to receive more respect in the other courts of western europe. We too, could follow suit, perhaps adopting a new set of guiding ideals. Such act could revive the fighting spirit on the nation and give us the will in to go forth despite the apparent risks of attack from foreign powers. Whatever the case may be, we must recognize this as a decision that will define our future."

However, there have also been voices to bring our cultures yet closer to our celtic brethren in the northwest. Such a proposal would undermine the importance of our culture but would be of benefit politically, especially if we wish to further expand into those territories. We must consider this proposal with utmost attention, as it could make or break our policy towards the Gaelic clans."
 ME_Cornwall_Events.3.a: "Let us promote this in our realm."
 ME_Cornwall_Events.3.a: "We are brothers mostly in name."
 
 ME_Cornwall_Events.4.t: "Birth of a Cornish Kingdom"
 ME_Cornwall_Events.4.d: "And 'Kingdom' is certainly an understatement! Our resilience in face of adversity is certainly commendable, as we have managed to rise from being one of the most oppressed and forgotten nations of Europe into the behemoth that we are known as today. Today, we realize that in the span of decades we have gone from an irrelevant power to one of the kingmakers of Western Europe. In this sense, we shall fulfill our purpose and proceed to continue in our exploits for the centuries to come. Cornwall will never again be forgotten in the pages of history!"
 ME_Cornwall_Events.4.a: "To imagine that we have come this far."
