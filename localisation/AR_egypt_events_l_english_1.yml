The recent developments and rise to power of our own control over the valley has given us much time to think.\n\nShould we wish to, we could invest considerable effort in the modernisation and perhaps even retooling of our military - allowing us to emulate one of our predeceding states would this be something that we would find desirable, though we may also opt to stay the course instead."

Yet, using what little bits of translation - gleamed from our own understanding and Hellenic writings, some amongst our scholarly circles have painstakingly worked through the establishment of a comprehensive dictionary and grammar method aimed at not only producing high quality translations but to teach new generations how one may read, write and speak the language of our ancestors.\n\nWith advancements such as the European printing press it was only a matter of time until this knowledge became widespread, leading not only to widespread interest in these texts, but a more broad interest in Egyptian history itself!"
 ar_egypt.392.desc:0 "The land of Egypt has always been strange and foreign, even tho those who have dwelled there for generations. To the Greeks it was a land of erudite barbarians dealing in myrrh and gold, to the Romans and Christians a land of deceit, to the Jews a land synonymous with misery. This has been compounded by a total absence of understanding of the innumerable murals and inscriptions half-buried in the sand - into which are inscribed words which we have always struggled to understand.\n\nBy a twist of fate however, this has changed. The discovery of Greek, Latin and Coptic inscriptions has led to some of our scholars to posit that a correspondence could be found between these and the Egyptian texts. And they were right, and soon the first publication addressing these texts were written, paving the way for an ever-increasing number of studies on the ancient Egyptian texts.\n\nWith advancements such as the European printing press it was only a matter of time until this knowledge became widespread, leading not only to widespread interest in these texts, but a more broad interest in Egyptian history itself!"
 ar_egypt.39.a:0 "Splendid!"

 ar_egypt.35.title:0 "A New Apis Bull" 
 ar_egypt.35.desc:0 "The Apis bull was important to our forbearers - being seen as the messenger and manifestation of the great God Ptah upon this earth. With the return of the Egyptian faith, so has come to need to tend to this sacred symbol. A new specimen, bearing the sacred markings, has been identified by some members of our clergy. They have petitioned us to do right by our traditions and provide them with the necessary fundings to not only purchase the beast but tend to its needs until it is called to join the Gods once more."
 ar_egypt.35.a:0 "We will honor this God as we would any other."
 ar_egypt.35.b:0 "Gods have all the comforts they need already."

 ar_egypt.40.title:0 "The Apis Bull" 
 ar_egypt.40.desc:0 "The Apis bull was important to our forbearers - being seen as the messenger and manifestation of the great God Ptah upon this earth by our Egyptian subjects even throughout Greek and even later Roman rule. The return of a more...open faith to the region has led to the re-establishment of this cult, at least in part, and they've petitioned our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for the necessary funds to care for this great, sacred beast - even if doing so might draw the ire of the more...conservative elements of our nobility."
 ar_egypt.40.a:0 "I am a child of the Nile as much as I am of Zeus"
 ar_egypt.40.b:0 "Barbarian practices have no place in the modern world."

 ar_egypt.41.title:0 "Spontaneous Syncreticism Develops" 
 ar_egypt.41.desc:0 "Our faith has always espoused religious syncreticism - to some extent, of course. It seems that these tenets, loose as they may be, have been taken to their somewhat natural conclusion in one of our provinces, leading to a sect of heretics reaching a dominant position within the province's most important city. Our clergy has advocated pragmatism, though it does not take a philosopher's acumen to realise that any such movement might greatly hamper any attempt to slow down an attempt at conversion."
 ar_egypt.41.a:0 "Leave them be."
 ar_egypt.41.b:0 "So, it's treason then."

 ar_egypt.42.title:0 "The Cult of Serapis Grows" 
 ar_egypt.42.desc:0 "The propagation of the cult of Serapis under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has led many to find themselves demonstrating a growing interest in preaching. These new priests have taken to participating in philosophical debates, the creation of small, academical fraternities and even enlisting themselves as bureaucrats. While these efforts are appreciated at all levels of our government, some of our clergy have expressed an interest at the possibility of bringing these souls into the fold - so to speak - and bring them in the service of a more structured ecclesiarchy."
 ar_egypt.42.a:0 "We should not damper their spirits."
 ar_egypt.42.b:0 "An errant mind cannot prosper - they need direction."

 ar_egypt.43.title:0 "The Nobility Worries About Deviancy" 
 ar_egypt.43.desc:0 "The cult of Serapis was always a syncretic - and fluid - framework; a system of belief joining Greek, Egyptian and even mystical elements. It has always been characterised by this chimeric disposition: and to some that is precisely the problem. For a few in our court such a blend is tantamount to abandoning our Hellenic roots in favour of bending the knee to the less civilised. And they are not necessarily being subtle in communicating their concerns."
 ar_egypt.43.a:0 "They are right..."
 ar_egypt.43.b:0 "They need to get over themselves."

 ar_egypt.44.title:0 "A Divine Monarch"
 ar_egypt.44.desc:0 "Egyptian monarchs - and many Hellenic ones as well - have always portrayed themselves with an aura of divinity. Alexander himself was praised by his troops and successors as the son of Zeus, and our predecessors, the Ptolemies, also embraced that lineage. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s competency as well as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] natural disposition has led many in our court to increasingly come to agree with the notion that the blood of Zeus flows through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] veins as well."
 ar_egypt.44.a:0 "They are right, of course."

 ar_egypt.45.title:0 "A Vain Claim"
 ar_egypt.45.desc:0 "Egyptian monarchs - and many Hellenic ones as well - have always portrayed themselves with an aura of divinity. Alexander himself was praised by his troops and successors as the son of Zeus, and our predecessors, the Ptolemies, also embraced that lineage. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s rather...lacklustre nature has led many in our court to increasingly come to challenge [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] claim to divinity - with some even claiming that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] suffers from madness!"
 ar_egypt.45.a:0 "I am a God!"
 ar_egypt.45.b:0 "Eliminate the more...vocal dissenters."
 ar_egypt.45.c:0 "Well, at least I'm still a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 ar_egypt.46.title:0 "New Philosophers"
 ar_egypt.46.desc:0 "Hellas is the birth place of democracy, the western theatre but also - and perhaps most importantly - western philosophy. With the re-establishment of a Hellenic state, many new thinkers, scholars and artists have emigrated or arisen in the [Root.GetName] in the past years. This new generation has come to present their services to our [Root.Monarch.GetName] - who was all too delighted to welcome their services."
 ar_egypt.46.a:0 "Wonderful!"

 ar_egypt.47.title:0 "Scholars Preach Heretical Beliefs"
 ar_egypt.47.desc:0 "While our faith was never one to emphasise a distinction between orthodoxy and heresy, there are lines even we should not cross: the open and vehement questioning of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s divine mandate being one of these. One of our advisors has been repeatedly and quite openly defying us - and while not necessarily treasonous, such behaviors is rather damaging to the image of our state and faith."
 ar_egypt.47.a:0 "They are an asset to our administration - leave them be."
 ar_egypt.47.b:0 "Decency is paramount - banish them."

 ar_egypt.48.title:0 "On the Back of Silk and Spice"
 ar_egypt.48.desc:0 "Trade and Hellas have always gone hand and hand with one another. Our merchants have come forth, and offered a bargain - to act as emissaries to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], as both men of faith and commerce. They only request that we allow them temporary and exclusive rights to a province in exchange. What should our response be?"
 ar_egypt.48.a:0 "They have our blessings."
 ar_egypt.48.b:0 "Support but supervise them."
 ar_egypt.48.c:0 "No."

 ar_egypt.49.title:0 "The Ebbs and Flows of Faith"
 ar_egypt.49.desc:0 "We have never been the sort to demand religions uniformity - even if would be preferable. Still, in this modern world where orthodoxy has triumphed, our attitudes must change if our faith is to thrive. This is all too exemplified by the situation in one of our provinces, where the majority of the populace as succumbed to a nearby preacher, converting to back to the tenets of a different religion, of a different God. Our clergy worries that this may herald a worrying trend and has urged us to act without delay."
 ar_egypt.49.a:0 "We are not the arbiters of truth."
 ar_egypt.49.b:0 "This cannot be tolerated!"

 ar_egypt.50.title:0 "Nobility Refuses to Assimilate"
 ar_egypt.50.desc:0 "In spite of our best efforts, there still remains elements of our nobility which have yet to embrace the Greek language and traditions. While under any other circumstances this might not necessarily be an issue this particular instance has become a focal point for disaffected nobles and loyalists alike - leading to the need for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to step in before the situation spirals out of control."
 ar_egypt.50.a:0 "We are Greek, and will they!"
 ar_egypt.50.b:0 "Let them be...for now"

 ar_egypt.51.title:0 "Local Population Resents Hellenisation"
 ar_egypt.51.desc:0 "As our predecessors have, we have strongly emphasised the necessity for our subjects to embrace our Hellenic traditions. To say we have encountered resistance however would be an understatement: a veritable riot has formed in one of our provinces, with Greek shops, houses and even now places of worship being ransacked. The local authorities have appealed to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for assistance and advice."
 ar_egypt.51.a:0 "Appease tensions as best we can."
 ar_egypt.51.b:0 "I can't hear you, try speaking Greek."

 ar_egypt.52.title:0 "Merchants Complain about Trade Policies"
 ar_egypt.52.desc:0 "The resurgence of the Greek language in the region has led to a fair few kerfuffles - so to speak - when it comes to our traders going about their business. The forced change from one language to another, as well as the added linguistical barriers and exacerbation of tensions - both cultural and religious - often requires administrative officials to intervene in even the pettiest matters."
 ar_egypt.52.a:0 "They better get used to Greek."
 ar_egypt.52.b:0 "Give them some autonomy."

 ar_egypt.53.title:0 "Soldiers Demand Land in Compensation"
 ar_egypt.53.desc:0 "The practice of paying soldiers with plots of land is not a new phenomenon. Both the Ptolemies and the Macedonian kings often rewarded their men with land grants when the loot or state treasuries were lacking. Our return to Egypt has, of course, led to this practice once more taking root.\n\nA group of veterans have come forth, and argued that due to mismanaged wages and poor compensation they are entitled to a more grounded form of compensation - threatening to desert shall we not agree to their terms."
 ar_egypt.53.a:0 "What is the aristocracy using that land for?"
 ar_egypt.53.b:0 "Men of faith need no land, after all"
 ar_egypt.53.c:0 "It's desertion, then."

 ar_egypt.54.title:0 "Greek Immigrants Settle in Hellenic Communities"
 ar_egypt.54.desc:0 "In the wake of the Roman empire's collapse and the rise of the Turks, Bulgars and even the Latins, the Greek community has been seeking new places to thrive and survive. Our country offers such an opportunity, leading many to settle within our towns and villages - amongst people whom they consider kin."
 ar_egypt.54.a:0 "Fantastic!"

 ar_egypt.55.title:0 "Community Adopts Greek Traditions"
 ar_egypt.55.desc:0 "A town under our administration has recently made great leaps in the matters of adopting our uses and customs, and although we are always encouraging even our more hesitant citizens to emulate our Hellenic roots, we are nonetheless pleasantly surprised that this particular community has progressed so quickly in the adoption of our culture."

 ar_egypt.60.title:0 "Nubian Caravans Bring Prosperity"
 ar_egypt.60.desc:0 "Our growing recovery of the Egyptian and Nubian regions as well as the increasing relevance of Alexandrian trade has led to more and more caravans to dare cross the southern cataracts and cross into the valley, bringing their wealth flowing into our coffers once more. Gold, incense, wood, gems, pelts and cloth abounds on the stalls of Nubian, Beja, Kushite and Arabic merchants in our capital as they did so long ago."
 ar_egypt.60.a:0 "This is fantastic!"

 ar_egypt.61.title:0 "Return of the Kushite Language"
 ar_egypt.61.desc:0 "The re-emergence of a Nubian dynasty at the head of an Egyptian state has led to the resurgence in Kushite and Nubian dialect in use throughout the Nile valley. This transition has been accompanied by the settlement of Sudanese, Nubian and Dongolese people, coming to Egypt seeking safety and prosperity...though such immigration does not come without its share of chaos."
 ar_egypt.61.a:0 "Let them do as they please."
 ar_egypt.61.b:0 "We cannot allow them the autonomy they crave."

 ar_egypt.62.title:0 "Prospecting for Gold"
 ar_egypt.62.desc:0 "The Nile valley and the surrounding areas have always been known as being mineral rich - the old Gods of Egypt were, after all, said to have flesh of gold and their hair made of lapis-lazuli. A prospector has arrived at court today - bringing with him a map that he claims leads to a forgotten mine. He has offered to sell it to us, for a price of course."
 ar_egypt.62.a:0 "Let's do it!"
 ar_egypt.62.b:0 "Legends are legends for a reason."

 ar_egypt.63.title:0 "A Nubian Prodigy"
 ar_egypt.63.desc:0 "The lands to the south of Egypt have in the past centuries come to be the home of prodigious archers. One of such accomplished soldier has been in the service of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for a few years now, and has come forth with a most intriguing proposal: to modernise our cavalry with fire-based tactics, emulating the Nubian prowess with ranged weapons atop horses. The proposal was been met with ridicule by some more traditional elements of our nobility, though it has received the reluctant admiration of a few."
 ar_egypt.63.a:0 "This man should lead our armies!"
 ar_egypt.63.b:0 "What brilliance!"
 ar_egypt.63.c:0 "A soldier has no business speaking out of place."

 ar_egypt.64.title:0 "Revival of Egyptian art"
 ar_egypt.64.desc:0 "The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs has, just as it did for when the Persians and the Greeks' own conquests, brought a wave of inspiration in the field of arts, shaping the generations of artisans, writers and thinkers. The Kushite reconqust of Egypt has in turn brought about its own ripples - with a marked interest for a more 'native' art taking root, with a particular focus on Nubian and even pagan art. Some of these new, creative minds, have made their way to our court - offering their services to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ar_egypt.64.a:0 "Wonderful!"

 ar_egypt.70.title:0 "The Oracle at Siwa"
 ar_egypt.70.desc:0 "Consulting the Oracle - regardless of patron or personal creed - has always been an integral part of pre-Christian Hellenic culture. Even during the late Roman emperors, some nobles still were susceptible to these ancient practices. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s endorsement of pagan traditions - at least publicly - means that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] is nominally expected to pay a visit to one such mystic who has settled in the Siwa oasis, just as Alexander himself once did."
 ar_egypt.70.a:0 "Fate will smile upon me."

 ar_egypt.71.title:0 "The Oracle's Response"
 ar_egypt.71.desc:0 "Through fumes the Oracle's frail, spasming body can be seen on the altar - surrounded by her attendants and fellow priests. Through her open mouth, escaping her throat through a crescendo of maddening psalms and chants, her vision comes through at last, after days of tribulations..."
