 LUX_burgundy_title: "Cancel the Sale"
 LUX_burgundy_desc: "In a bout of seemingly sudden hysteria, we have decided to cancel the sale of our duchy to Phillip III of Burgundy and now shall fight for our independence. Its as if an finger of god moved our will."
 LUX_brandenburg_potential_title: "Demand the Kurmark"
 LUX_brandenburg_potential_desc: "As Charles the IV once did to the Wittelsbachs, we can demand the abdication of Hohenzollerns from the margraviate of Brandenburg and place ourselves upon their throne, using our claim to their throne as justification. Naturally, they will resist our efforts, and we shall have to beat them in a show of force."
 LUX_brandenburg_title: "Verge of the Empire"
 LUX_brandenburg_desc: "The military campaign succeeded, and we now hold Brandenburg's title alongside our own. Other boons have come with the throne, as we found a fledgling military system that could grow into something great if we encourage it.  "
 LUX_von_luxemburg_title: "The Von Luxemburg"
 LUX_von_luxemburg_desc: "With our independence, we should naturally return the throne to its proper ruler, the Luxembourgs. We can use their claims to reclaim our once great position in the theatre of Europe, and their happens to be a great contender for a Duke among their ranks."
 LUX_bohemia_potential_title: "Defenestrate the Impostors"
 LUX_bohemia_potential_desc: "The Defenestrations of 1419 once shocked our great Wenceslaus of Bohemia to death. We are right to take revenge on the imposters now on the Bohemian throne. Through military force, we can press our claim and defenestrate those who dare oppose us."
 LUX_bohemia_title: "The Winter King"
 LUX_bohemia_desc: "The Bohemian's have begun to don [Root.Monarch.GetName] as the Winter King, to show their hate after the forceful takeover from their elected choice. We should take no slander and act to silence this, lest resistance starts to appear in forms of more than slander."
 LUX_glory_to_von_luxemburg_title: "Glory to the von Luxemburg!"
 LUX_glory_to_von_luxemburg_desc: "The Luxembourg have once again found their place in the grand theatre, and delivered a shocking performance. Time to take a bow, and enjoy the applause, for the performance is over, and Luxembourg is secured as one of the greats in the theatre which is Europe."
 LUX_tall_title: "Tiny Yet Formidable"
 LUX_tall_desc: "Our duchy's ancestral lands are small, but that never stopped us before. Now with efforts to grow the city, Luxembourg has developed into a truly prosperous land. This prosperous land is about to bear fruit, which we can take advantage to further our efforts outside of our tiny duchy."
 LUX_hungary_potential_title: "Repulse the Habsburgs"
 LUX_hungary_potential_desc: "The Habsburgs have been snaking their way into our old claims, and now hold Hungary in their grasp, yet their hand shakes. We could take advantage of the current unstable situation, and act first in the name of Sigismund's claim to the Hungarian throne. With a quick show of force, we could be on Hungarian throne once again."
 LUX_hungary_title: "Bulwark of Christendom"
 LUX_hungary_desc: "Our succession to the throne in Hungary has lead us to now stand on the edge of europe, the border of christendom. The efforts of Sigismund of Luxembourg prepared Hungary well for its role, and we should take advantage of our forebearer's actions. We will be the bulwark of Christendom for the future to come. "
 LUX_sublime_city_title: "Sublime City"
 LUX_sublime_city_desc: "Luxembourg, while often overlooked has developed into something of a spectacular city to its counterparts. Its opportune position between France and Germany has long lead to conflicts over its soil, but similarly, that conflict lead to investment in its defensive position, which naturally spurred an economy to support itself. If we properly invest in Luxembourgs development, it may become a truly sublime city. "
 LUX_bock_title: "Expand the Bock"
 LUX_bock_desc: "The Bock has become essential to the defensive position of Luxembourg. Expanding it, now once again the residence of Dukes of Luxembourg, makes more sense than ever."
 LUX_fontaine_title: "Fontaine Castle"
 LUX_fontaine_desc: "Another castle shall be built aside the city, in a much more modern style. La Fontaine shall be a true regal home for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Luxembourg, freeing up room in the Bock for more defensive measures."
 LUX_exploit_via_regia_title: "Exploit the Via Regia"
 LUX_exploit_via_regia_desc: "The Via Regia in recent years has lengthened to add our sublime city to its route, and presents new opportunities regarding trade amongst our german neighbours. With smart investment, we could profit immensely from these opportunties."
 LUX_moselle_title: "Moselle Trade"
 LUX_moselle_desc: "The Moselle presents vast opportunities to the developing Luxembourg Merchants. Our investments in the Via Regia got them onto their feet, and now they have expanded their efforts into the river trade. They come now with a proposition to organise a treaty with neighbouring city of Coblenz, so they could go on to dominate the Moselle, and perhaps the Rhine."
 LUX_thungen_title: "Fort Thüngen"
 LUX_thungen_desc: "The Bock has been outgrown, and now the city clearly needs an expansion of fortifications, perhaps even a new fort. This new fort, based in the south of the city, would be called Thüngen. Thüngen would allow us to focus the Bock has entirely on military matters, as well as expand our standing garrison at Luxembourg city, thus it would be an all-round good investment."
 LUX_gibraltar_title: "Gibraltar of the North"
 LUX_gibraltar_desc: "Our recent investment into new fortification technology, and its implementation into the advantageous terrain that is the Bock, has lead to a new title for the city. The Gibralter of the North. The famed Gibralter is seen as impregnable, and we now share that status. If Luxembourg can fall, then pigs can fly."

 ME_Luxemburg_Events.1.t: "Return of the Von Luxemburgs"
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.1.d: "With our independence, many noble families have staked their claim to our throne, but one in particular caught our eye. The Luxembourgs. Named after the dukedom itself, they are the obvious choice. However, they also offer an extremely skilled contender, one who might be capable of performing great feats in the theatre of Europe."
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.1.a: "Welcome the claimant!"
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.1.b: "They are but a fake!"
 
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.2.t: "Rulers of the Kurmark"
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.2.d: "As a smaller duchy, our new union thinks they can demand a certain level of autonomy, or they will openly seek their independence. We could use our closest relatives to give a facade of autonomy, pleasing their desires, or we could prepare their realm for integration, relying on force to keep our place on the throne."
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.2.a: "Introduce our Luxemburg Relatives."
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.2.b: "Keep their rights as is." 
 
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.3.t: "The Deadly Regency"
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.3.d: "The Bohemian throne has been in a long period of regency and during that time, nobles have begun to entrench themselves, giving themselves more power in the Bohemian lands. While their intial defense failed, no doubt they will continue to be antagonistic. We could however, place a skilled family member into the system to slowly disassemble their power, restricting their ability to gain independence. We could also leave the regency in place, which would likely make it easier to integrate the kingdom once we have crushed the nobles desires for independence. "
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.3.a: "The von Luxemburg will do just fine."
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.3.b: "Let them keep their regency."
 
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.4.t: "The Power Vacuum"
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.4.d: "Pressing our claim to the Hungarian throne has left it in a power vacuum, where we have to establish how we are going to control the kingdom, far away as it is from our holdings in Luxembourg. We could enlist the help of our family to ensure Luxembourg control over the realm, though Hungarian nobles will likely resist any centralisation efforts in that case. Instead, we could pick a Hungarian governor, and promise autonomy. This would likely lead to a short-term thirst for independence, but if we can keep them under our heel, the Hungarians will be accepting of a more centralised system in the future."
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.4.a: "We will fill that vacuum."
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.4.b: "Self rule is key to control." 
 
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.5.t: "Importing Goods"
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.5.d: "The expansion of the Via Regia through Luxembourg has given us unprecedented access to importing goods like salt, which could be key to resisting a siege. Of course, we would have to establish a reasonable industry to use the salt in future, lest we end up stockpiling for an event that does not come. Instead, we could choose to let the trade develop organically, and it would likely result in far greater profits."
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.5.a: "Import Salt to help endure a siege."
 ME_Luxemburg_Events.5.b: "Invest in the rich trades!"
