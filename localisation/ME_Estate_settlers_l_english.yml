However, this has long since been brushed off, with many a place in those wild stretches of the world still having been left to uncertainty.\n\nHowever, times have changed. Those powers that first got their hands in the colonial game of influence, exploration, and conquest have realized that the chances for new discoveries and settlements have begun to dry up as the natives are pushed further and further inland, and as solidified zones of influence in the continents clash against eachother with little chance of change.\n\nMeanwhile, those powers who were largely late or absent in the New World have begun to realize that their share of the wealth is small or non-existent compared to their peers. Their chances for exploration have dried up, as the new powers of the world have the resources and capital to carve the world amongst them that the others lack.\n\nThe last dash for the American interior has begun, may God have mercy on those caught in the crossfire."
