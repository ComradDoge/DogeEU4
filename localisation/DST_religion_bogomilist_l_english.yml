 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.1.d: "After months of hard and tedious work, two [Root.GetAdjective] theologians have completed a religious writing, consisting of Bible excerpts and psalms accompanied by enchanting miniatures and other impressive artistic illustrations.

 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.1.a: "Prestigious"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.2.t: "Heresy in [draguvitian_province.GetName]"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.2.d: "A Christian sect preaching strange and blasphemous doctrines has been able to exist unnoticed in [draguvitian_province.GetName] until now. Since we had not discovered it until now, this sect was spreading unhindered and is practiced even publicly today. Their principles collide with ours, so we cannot coexist!"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.2.a: "Their deviant ideals must be destroyed!"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.2.b: "This will settle down with time"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.3.t: "A New Church?"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.3.d: "Traditionally, our churches are built of wood, but this makes them look puny and unassuming next to Italian cathedrals or Greek basilicas made of stone. The construction of a new church for one of our cities is planned, though it has not yet been decided if it will be built of wood or if we will break our tradition and have it built of stone."
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.3.a: "Stone is the preferred material"

 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.4.d: "An influential noble family, with whose members [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has repeatedly come into conflict, was baptized by a Catholic bishop, expressing their displeasure with our nation! This is an affront to the [Root.GetAdjective] Church and could develop into a political lever if we do not forbid this blasphemy."
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.4.a: "Accuse them of heresy"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.4.b: "Ignore this behavior"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.5.t: "Crumbling Necropolis"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.5.d: "Magnificent monolithic gravestones, called Stecci, are a characteristic feature of our funerary culture. One of our largest and most impressive cemeteries, where the ancestors of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] were buried, has recently been left to nature, causing the Stecci to slowly decay.\nA renowned sculptor now offers us to renovate the dilapidated tombstones and make them even more splendid."
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.5.a: "Hire him"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.5.b: "We do not need his services"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.6.t: "Poor Theological Training"
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.6.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Church is responsible for ecclesiastical affairs in our nation, including the education of young clergy. However, due to financial constraints in recent years, the training of the youngest priests has been neglected, resulting in a generation of incompetent priests who often cannot address the simplest theological questions."
 dse_bogomilist_religious_events.6.a: "This is bad"

 incompetent_clergy: "Incompetent Clergy"
 desc_incompetent_clergy: "A significant number of our clergy have received poor theological training."

This earthly prison shall be shattered and the people within liberated from the Satan's works. It is time for cleansing."
