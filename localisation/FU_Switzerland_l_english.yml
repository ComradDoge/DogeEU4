You say, ‘but the idlers will eat meat without needing to.’ The answer is that these very same people fill themselves with even richer foods, which enflame them even more than the highly-seasoned highly-spiced meats...' \n\nThus, the debate over the dietary habits of Christians, sparked the beginning of the Reformation in Switzerland."

 #Events#
 FU_Switzerland_Events.1.t: "Manufacturing & Trading of Swiss Embroidery" 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.1.d: "St. Gallen embroidery, sometimes known as Swiss embroidery, is embroidery from the city and the region of St. Gallen, Switzerland. Around [GetYear], its embroidery production was the largest export branch of the Swiss economy with 18 percent of the overall export value. The Swiss embroidery factories will eventually come to produce more than 50 percent of the world production due to its workers' tremendous skills and trade secrets, for centuries." 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.1.a: "Darling, you look fabulous!"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.1.b: "But not that fabulous."
 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.2.t: "Swiss Cheese" 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.2.d: "Said to be discovered around the Neolithic Age, the Swiss Cheese became one of the proudest products in the said region. It was first recorded by Pliny the Elder around the first century, which he describes as "Caseus Helveticus". Switzerland has been a cheese hub since the Middle Ages and, like many European countries, it has always taken its culinary reputation very seriously. And in many ways, that seriousness has actually hindered its international appeal. A heavily government-subsidized organization called the Swiss Cheese Union enjoyed complete control over both production and export throughout much of the industrialized 18th and 19th centuries, dictating in no uncertain terms exactly how, where, and when Switzerland’s cheeses could be made. In the name of economic virility, the Union threw practically all of its weight behind just three top-sellers out of the country’s many beloved heritage styles—earthy, nutty Gruyère; the fragrant, Parmesan-like Sbrinz, and Emmentaler, better known as “the one with the holes.” (Appenzeller, a semi-hard cheese used in fondue, would join the pack later.) This effectively rendered the unapproved varieties obsolete and gave the rest of the world a very narrow understanding of Swiss cheesemaking." 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.2.a: "Blessed are the cheesemakers!"
 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.3.t: "Treaty of Eternal Direction"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.3.d: "The Eternal Direction was a peace and alliance treaty that the eight towns of the Old Confederation concluded in [GetYear] with the Austrian Archduke . With this treaty, the military conflict between the House of Habsburg and the Swiss , which had been going on since 1291, ended for the time being. \n\nBoth parties had elected the French King as a mediator. The negotiations took place in Constance with the mediation of Bishop Hermann III. from Breitenlandenberg . A first version of the agreement was completed earlier this year, but it was not until several months later before the royal French mediator  was able to ratify the final version of the treaty."
 FU_Switzerland_Events.3.a: "For peace!"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.3.b: "We will never give up our territories to the Swiss!"
 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.4.t: "William Tell and Arnold von Winkelried"
 FU_Switzerland_Events.4.d: "William Tell and Arnold von Winkelried are folk heroes of Switzerland. According to the legend, Tell was an expert marksman with the crossbow who assassinated Albrecht Gessler, a tyrannical reeve of the Austrian dukes of the House of Habsburg positioned in Altdorf, in the canton of Uri. Tell's defiance and tyrannicide encouraged the population to open rebellion and a pact against the foreign rulers with neighbouring Schwyz and Unterwalden, marking the foundation of the Swiss Confederacy. \n\nArnold Winkelried's sacrifice, on the other hand, brought about the victory of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the Battle of Sempach (1386) over the army of the Habsburg Duke Leopold III of Austria. According to legend, the Swiss initially could not break the close ranks of the Habsburg pikemen. Winkelried cried: "I will open a passage into the line; protect, dear countrymen and confederates, my wife and children..." He then threw himself upon the Austrian pikes, taking some of them down with his body. This broke up the Austrian front, and made an opening through which the Swiss could attack." 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.4.a: "Our national spirit is unyielding!"
 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.5.t: "The Swiss Confederation" 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.5.d: "By the second half of the 14th century, the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and Zug and the Lucerne, Zürich and Bern city states to form the "Old Confederacy" of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation. By the 1440s, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains, particularly after victories against the Habsburgs. \n\nDespite the fact that the Confederacy did not operate smoothly all the time, it served its purpose quite efficiently. In times of crisis, it gathered all the city-members together, under one banner, to defend the ideals of democracy and republican virtue. \n\nIt now befalls you to expand the Confederacy and protect your future brethren from outside foes. Good luck..." 
 FU_Switzerland_Events.5.a: "Let us move forward, together."
