 GRA_our_plea_for_help_desc: "Our most ancient kingdom is in a dire need of help. Let our cries echo throughout the Dar al-Islam, as Granada needs someone to ensure the longevity of our faith in Iberia."
 GRA_loyal_allies_title: "Loyal Allies"
 GRA_loyal_allies_desc: "Basic guarantees of independence may already do us a lot of good, but what is a dubious ally worth? We must seek alliances forged by mutual interests and friendship. Only then may we feel safe."
 GRA_lend_lease_title: "Lends and Leases"
 GRA_lend_lease_desc: "Active contribution is what we seek in our allies. If our Emirate comes under attack, it may be too late for before their help can make any differnce. Therefore, we should also require that our supporters deliver on their arming promises."
 GRA_gharb_title: "Reconquer Al-Gharb"
 GRA_gharb_desc: "The western region of the core Andalusian realm was conquered by the Portuguese centuries ago, and it has been a distant dream to retake these lands ever since. We must restore our control over these lands and reignite the naval ambitions of past times!"
 GRA_western_march_title: "Al-Tagr al-Adna"
 GRA_western_march_desc: "It is time we push the Portuguese back even further! The waterways along the Aveiro that we once held are great natural fortifications against enemy marches, and they must be retaken if we hope to re-establish a strong rule over Al-Tagr al-Adna."
 GRA_civil_war_title: "Quell the Resistance"
 GRA_civil_war_desc: "Dire times are ahead for the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]. Constant internal strife is making the relationship between the family members tight. It is clear a civil war is about to tear the last daughter of Al-Andalus apart."
 GRA_stable_leadership_title: "Stable Leadership"
 GRA_stable_leadership_desc: "Now that our people are no longer at each others' throats, and the last of the usurpers have been silenced, we can now look outward to restore the Kingdom that once was."
 GRA_reconquer_muwsat_title: "Restore al-Mawsat"
 GRA_reconquer_muwsat_desc: "As the fertile, arable lands of southern Iberia that were once the symbol of prosperous Andalusian rule, the towns of al-Mawsat carry the remnants of al-Andalus. Our brothers and sisters in faith, though in hiding, number many, waiting for our return. Let us liberate them and reunite the Andalusian people!" 
 GRA_middle_march_title: "Al-Tagr Al-Awsat"
 GRA_middle_march_desc: "Despite our early successes, by no means does it bring any certainty to our control over the Iberian Peninsula. If we are to unite it, contol over the plains in Al-Tagr Al-Awsat is vital to unlock marching routes for our armies into northern Iberia."
 GRA_secure_an_advantage_title: "Securing an Advantage"
 GRA_secure_an_advantage_desc: "The threat of a Castilian offensive ever looms, and their extensive hold over Iberia means they will always outnumber us. If we are to survive the oncoming tide, we must find allies, and perhaps innovate our military doctrines as well." 
 GRA_break_out_of_containment_title: "Break Out!"
 GRA_break_out_of_containment_desc: "To arms! Today, we fight for the future of our nation. May the flames of glory burn ever brighter with our victory, or fight to the last limb with defeat! Let us break from the chokehold the Christians hold on us, one way or another."
 GRA_reconquer_levant_title: "Reconquer Al-Xarq"
 GRA_reconquer_levant_desc: "If we are to have any ambition towards the greater Mediterranean, we must first establish a foothold in it. The Catalan coastal range, as well as the ports traversing the length, were vital to maritime trade between our Kingdom and mercantile states dotting the Mediterranean Sea. By restoring Al-Xarq, our economy will flourish once more."
 GRA_northeast_march_title: "Al-Tagr al-A'la"
 GRA_northeast_march_desc: "By now, a large portion of Iberia is within our hands, but we cannot yet rest. Already, the eyes of the rest of the Christian world are turning to us, wary of the resurgence of another Islamic kingdom within the Peninsula. If we are to protect ourselves from a crusade, we must fortify our borders within the mountains of Al-Tagar al-A'al. Perhaps in time, our northeast march will lead us deeper into Europe."
 GRA_siege_mentality_title: "Siege Mentality"
 GRA_siege_mentality_desc: "Ever since the Iberian Reconquista started in the 8th century, Muslim control has waned over the Peninsula. The Umayyads and the succeeding dynasties all failed to maintain control of the lands the Kingdom of Al-Andalus once held at the apex of its might, ceding territory after territory to the Christian kingdoms with each lost war. To this day, the Muslims in Iberia have fleed to what now is the Emirate of Granada, the last vestige of Islam present in the region. Generations of families have told stories of the suffocating feeling, of never knowing when the Christian crusaders could come knocking. Our brothers have stood strong under hardship, and we should make the most of their experience." 
 GRA_forced_contribution_title: "Forced Contribution"
 GRA_forced_contribution_desc: "We are at a key moment in time, a crossroads in our future. If we are to make certain of our victory, the factions that govern the Emirate must understand that they need to contribute to the war effort." 
 GRA_the_great_mosque_title: "The Great Mosque"
 GRA_the_great_mosque_desc: "The Great Mosque of Garnatah is the beating heart of the city. Aptly placed in the centre of the capital district, the Great Mosque, much like the Great Mosque of Kairouan, became both a place of worship and learning early on in its lifetime. The Great Mosque itself was constructed in order to promote growth in the capital city, and as such is surrounded in souqs and commerical establishments, most notably the al-Qasariyya to its south-east. Northeast of the Mosque is the 'Rahbat Masjid al-A'Zam' or 'Square of the Great Mosque'. As such, the Great Mosque services the majority of the Granadan population and is an indispensible part of the Emirate."
 GRA_court_of_lions_title: "Court of the Lions"
 GRA_court_of_lions_desc: "Found within the Al-Hambra citadel, the Court (or Palace) of the Lions is the palace that lies within its heart. Consisting of a rectangular courtyard centered on a marble fountain supported by twelve sculpted lions it connects to smaller fountains in four surrounding main halls through water channels. These main halls themselves featured some of the most elaborate and magnificent muqarnas vaults in the Islamic world. The architecture of the Court was a hallmark of Nasrid Granadan design and was deservedly one of the most famous palaces within the Islamic world."
 GRA_alhambra_title: "Al-Hambra Citadel"
 GRA_alhambra_desc: "Originally constructed in the 13th century under the first Nasrid emir, Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar and his rule of Granada, the Al-Hambra Citadel is both a palace and a fortress city. A representation of the ideology of the Muslim refugees in Granada and their hardships, the Al-Hambra complex was first built to be self-contained, with all amenities found in any Muslim city. It was not until the reigns of Yusuf I and Muhammad V in the 15th century that the iconic Palace of the Lions was added to the citadel, of which gave the Al-Hambra Citadel its definitive character. Not only this, as the citadel is of particular import to our history, with many of our Nasrid rulers having been buried here, Al-Hambra is the shining symbol of Andalusian culture and Muslim history in Iberia."
 GRA_majorca_title: "Conquer Baleares"
 GRA_majorca_desc: "Before Al-Andalus once held the Balearic Islands, they were notorious for being used as launching points for pirate raids upon our coastal towns. Even as we strengthen our grip on the mainland, if we do not take control of these isles for ourselves, the Muslim cause may yet again suffer the same fate."
 GRA_invite_the_faithful_title: "Invite the Refugees"
 GRA_invite_the_faithful_desc: "As our faithful brothers and sisters flee the hands of the Christian rule, they arrive at our gates, empowering our own cities. Their strength in hardship brings reinvigoration to our conviction, and we should make the most of this situation."
 GRA_qaysariyya_title: "Al-Qaysariyya"
 GRA_qaysariyya_desc: "Much like the Al-Hambra Citadel and the Great Mosque of Granada, the al-Qaysariyya, or bazaars of Granada, were a trademark of the city of Granada's rapid growth under Nasrid rule. Accompanying the bazaars were the Madrasa al-Yusufiyya and the Funduq al-Jadida caravanserai, which together jointly comprised of the commercial heart of the city. Lying in the heart of the city, the al-Qaysariyya itself was traditionally a Nasrid owned marketplace, selling high value goods such as silk."
 GRA_naval_superiority_title: "Naval Superiority"
 GRA_naval_superiority_desc: "No matter how many allies we can gather, if we are to ever escape this grim fate, we need to establish grain lines from our allies in the Maghreb. Without maritime control of the Gibraltar straits, this will be impossible. Their ships number great, but we must number greater."
 GRA_ceuta_title: "Reconquer Sabtah"
 GRA_ceuta_desc: "Control over Sabtah once gave us nominal control over both sides of the Gibraltar strait, enriching our state from any merchants wishing to pass through. Our ambitions of a greater Andalusian state lie in first regaining this foothold in the Maghreb."
 
 GRA_dar_jihad_title: "Dar Jihad"
 GRA_dar_jihad_desc: "As a nation encountering a blend of cultures, beliefs and languages, even as we practice religious sufferance and promote a focus on learning, we will inevitably encounter conflicts. Given that most of these will be primarily religious, the Andalusian states of old have been called 'Dar Jihad', or a nation fo Jihad. This attracts zealous volunteers to join our army. While they do not completely align with our national traditions, if they are to join their brothers in the ranks, they will still need to listen to our orders."

 GRA_outposts_in_the_gold_coast_title: "Outposts in Sahil al-Eaj"
 GRA_outposts_in_the_gold_coast_desc: "All throughout our storied history, never has our control reached into the savannahs and jungles of sub-Saharan Africa. Though routes through the Sahara desert into the Sahel have long been used by the Maghrebi Arab traders, rising powers within the region may threaten our prospering trade. Perhaps, there is another route - naval routes to outposts in Sahil al-Eaj."
 GRA_onto_the_cape_title: "Ras al-Raja' al-Saalih"
 GRA_onto_the_cape_desc: "With the fall of the Silk Road and an emerging rivalry with powers in the traditional land routes through north Africa, the Levant and Persia, we need to find alternative routes to reach Asia. Let us set an outpost on the southern tip of Africa - the Ras al-Raja' al-Saalih."
 GRA_kilwa_title: "Amiable Relations"
 GRA_kilwa_desc: "The spread of Islam has reached far, and we have encountered brothers in the faith along the Zanzibar coast. Let us garner relationships with them, and perhaps they shall share their expertise with us." 
 GRA_madinat_alazahara_title: "Madinat al-Zahra"
 GRA_madinat_alazahara_desc: "The fortified palace-city of Madinat al-Zahra was built during the reign of Ad-ar-Rahman III, who ruled Al-Andalus for the first half of the 10th century. As the first of the Qurtubah-based Umayyad caliphs, Ad-ar-Rahman III ordered this to built to be used as a seat of power befitting his new title. The city, build near the pre-existing capital Cordoba, would serve as the political capital before it was sacked at the turn of the 11th century, and consequently abandoned."
 GRA_tulaytulah_title: "Restore Tulaytulah"
 GRA_tulaytulah_desc: "Throughout the tumultuous history of the Iberian Peninsula, no matter who has maintained control of the city, Tulaytulah has remained as an important literary and ecclestiastical centre to the region. By making it the administrative capital of al-Tagr al-Awsat, we will continue this tradition."
 GRA_ummayad_frontier_title: "Umayyad Frontier"
 GRA_ummayad_frontier_desc: "The restoration of Al-Andalus is almost complete, and the glory of apex Umayyad power once again flows through the cities of Iberia. It is clear the Christian kingdoms are no match for us any longer, and our grip over these lands gains strength with each passing day." 
 GRA_finish_off_crusader_kingdoms_title: "Finish Them Off"
 GRA_finish_off_crusader_kingdoms_desc: "We once made the mistake of allowing the remnants of Christian states to remain in the Peninsula, and we paid for it with several centuries of hardship and stagnation. Let us not make the same mistake again, and eliminate the last vestiges of the Christian kingdoms, once and for all!"

 GRA_iberian_discoveries_title: "Brave the Bahr al-Zulamat"
 GRA_iberian_discoveries_desc: "Legends speak of two legendary isles within Bahr al-Zulamat, the Sea of Darkness - Jazirat al-Jawhar and Jazirat al-Yaqut, The Islands of the Jewel and Sapphire. If we are to discover for ourselves if the legends speak true, we must brave the unknown. Bring our best explorers, for many may not return from the treacherous waters of Bahr al-Zulamat..." 
 GRA_islamize_local_peoples_title: "Islamize Local Peoples"
 GRA_islamize_local_peoples_desc: "All along the western coast of Africa, we have set trade outposts. Perhaps, we could use these ports to send missionaries and spread the Islamic faith to those who have not had the chance to convert." 
 GRA_mexico_title: "Wadian al-Dhahab"
 GRA_mexico_desc: "The almustakshif under our employ bring word from the world west of our lands, past the Bahr al-Zulamat and past the Antilia. Where we have the picturesque valleys in the Jibal Albirinii, they describe the lands as 'valleys of gold'. Perhaps we should send an expedition, and see if these 'valleys' can be brought to our shores." #Jibal Albirinii is Pyrenees
 GRA_malayan_muslims_title: "Malayan Muslims"
 GRA_malayan_muslims_desc: "Though Islam has managed to spread to the Straits of Melakkah, the strength of the Islamic states here in Malaya is tenuous at best. As defenders of the faith, we should aid them and ensure faith here remains strong."
 GRA_restore_qurtubah_title: "Restore Qurtubah"
 GRA_restore_qurtubah_desc: "First taken by Muslim forces in 711, Qurtubah was governed under direct Arab rule for the next several centuries and made the provincial capital. At the apex of Umayyad power, the city was the political capital, as well as a cultural, academic and economic centre of not just the Khilafat Qurtubah, but of Europe as a whole. Qurtubah has withstood the test of time still one of the most advanced cities of the world, and remained a conduit between Islamic and Christian worlds. Let us restore the city to its former glory."
 GRA_capital_title: "Capital of a Caliphate"
 GRA_capital_desc: "The traditional agricultural lands of Lower Andalusia, now that they are safe from foreign incursions, are free to be developed. A growing, resurging kingdom needs to feed itself, after all."
 GRA_cities_of_the_empire_title: "Cities of the Empire"
 GRA_cities_of_the_empire_desc: "With the triumph of the Islamic cause over the Christian kingdoms, we must settle down and repair the devastation such a long conflict has wrought. There is much to be gained in rebuilding the cities of the empire, so let us first focus on those who have suffered the longest, and ease their pains as much as we can." 
 GRA_sevilha_title: "Golden Age of Ishbiliyah"
 GRA_sevilha_desc: "The ports of Ishbiliyah have long brought prosperity to Al-Andalus, with all manor of people arriving in the ports. From those simply wanting to trade their wares, to those who seek a better education, enlightenment or even living a new life here. With the addition of expeditions to the new world, and the riches they bring back; right now is the Golden Age of Ishbiliyah."
 GRA_catalonia_title: "The Mountain Passes"
 GRA_catalonia_desc: "The last time that we held these mountain passes were at the apex of Umayyad strength in 719, and since then it was forever lost. The Jibal Albirinii bordering the Catalonian strip provided defense from the north, and gave us the confidence to push into Septimania. Not only that, the lush grasslands and ports in Balansiyah are flooded with Italian traders. Even if our ambitions do not stop in Iberia, we must retake these Catalonian lands, for they are rightfully ours!"
 GRA_france_title: "Second Battle of Tours"
 GRA_france_desc: "It was here in October, 732 that the Umayyad army, lead by Abdul Rahman Al-Ghafiqi, clashed with the combined Frankish and Aquitanian forces, lead by the great general Charles Martel. It was here, at the apex of Andalusian might, was resoundingly defeated, and signalled the eventual downfall of our empire. It was here that the Caliphal cause receded like a tide, never able to push past the Pyrenees. It is here that we take a stand once more, and this time, stand ready. This time, WE will be the ones to change the course of history." 
 GRA_high_seas_navy_title: "High Seas Navy"
 GRA_high_seas_navy_desc: "If we are to recruit brave men and women to sail the high seas and explore the unknown, we will need the ships to withstand their bravery. Only the most durable of ships will fit the cause."
 GRA_caribbean_title: "Reach the Islands"
 GRA_caribbean_desc: "Landfall! The isles of the Carribean have finally revealed themselves to our hardy explorers. The natives, curious about our people and our ships, have bartered their local goods for our own foods and animals. It seems that we have reached the next frontier for the ambitions of Al-Andalus."
 GRA_colony_caribbean_title: "Al-Mudun al-Sabe"
 GRA_colony_caribbean_desc: "Jazur al-Mudun al-Sabe, better known as the Isles of the Seven Cities, was the first place we made landfall when our brave explorers sailed west into the unknown. Already, droves of people have embarked on the journey over to the islands of Antillia, eager to make a new life out of it. Such is their fervour, they have already elected a governor to properly manage the growth in the region. Well, who are we to stop them?" 
 GRA_sugar_title: "Importing Sugar"
 GRA_sugar_desc: "It appears that there is a new craze for this so called 'white gold'. As the sugar crops grow rapidly in the tropical conditions of the New World, we cannot harvest them fast enough! Ship after ship arrive in our ports, hauling barrels of them to swathes of merchants, eager to take them off their hands. We must take advantage of this trend!"
 GRA_gather_translators_title: "Gather Translators"
 GRA_gather_translators_desc: "The prosperity of Al-Andalus and the flourishing of our Andalusi culture has attracted all manner of intellectual individuals to Qurtubah, transforming it into a cultural and intellectual centre. Already, our Library contains hundreds of thousands of copies of works translated from Greek to Arabic, Latin and Hebrew. The continued patronage of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] enables us to continue the legacy of great figures like Ziryab and Ibn Darraj al-Qastali. Our translators will be most useful as we bring more cultures into our fold in the future, so we should continue to support them in our court."
 GRA_library_of_cordoba_title: "Library of Cordoba"
 GRA_library_of_cordoba_desc: "Despite the tumultuous history of our homeland, the Library of Qurtubah has withstood the test of time - perhaps even the Christians found value in a safehouse of knowledge. Regardless, the Library has enlightened our scholars in past centuries, and by expanding the library to include places of learning, will keep doing so for the centuries to come."
 GRA_print_some_books_title: "Print the Quran"
 GRA_print_some_books_desc: "As the knowledge of the printing press arrives in our borders from the German states, much like the revelations there, we are now able to print the Quran at an unimaginable pace. We should distribute these copies to the masses to strengthen our faith, lest we get caught up in a Reformation of our own. The amirs may not be happy, but it's a sacrifice we are going to have to make." 
 GRA_balansiyah_title: "Balance in Balansiyah"
 GRA_balansiyah_desc: "Balansiyah is iconic for its high-quality silk and textiles. Traders from the nearby mercantile Genoa, Venice and even the Byzantines have long been patrons of the silk produced in Balansiyah because of the premium prices they fetch back in Italy - such is the hegemony of Balansiyah over the silk trade in the Mediterranean. By directly supporting the textile industry here, we enrich the state tremendously." 
 GRA_mediterranean_title: "Muslim Mediterraneans"
 GRA_mediterranean_desc: "Islands are present all across the Mediterranean. Some have been out of reach of Islam for one reason or another, and some, like Crete and Sicily were once under Muslim rule. Regardless, these islands will make great naval bases for our nation, beneficial as naval bases and trader outposts alike."
 GRA_south_morocco_title: "Subjugate Sus"
 GRA_south_morocco_desc: "Before the Lesser Atlas mountains lies the Sous savannahs, a fertile region capable of high agricultural production. These lands in southern Morocco were said to have been once divided between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims according to Ibn Hawqal, but it is suspected that is a lie, and that the Shi'a were a minority at best."
 GRA_tunis_title: "Trounce Tunisia"
 GRA_tunis_desc: "The Tunisians once claimed the title of Ifriqiyan Caliphate, with their meagre economy and paltry strength. Their shaky hold over the local Berber tribes show their weakness - these pretenders cannot even protect their borders much less the Muslim faith! Their cities once fell to the Umayyad Caliphate, and they shall do so again."
 GRA_treasure_fleet_en_route_title: "Treasure Fleets En Route"
 GRA_treasure_fleet_en_route_desc: "Our colonial ventures have expanded far across the American continents, and now our efforts are bearing fruit. The governors, in their inspiring show of loyalty, have ordered flotillas of ships laden with gold from the numerous mines to be sent back to us yearly. While this is great news, we must caution ourselves and ensure this does not harm our economy."
 GRA_rival_navies_title: "Rival the British"
 GRA_rival_navies_desc: "Our empire has reached far greater growth than it has ever seen. From one end of the Atlantic Ocean to the other, from the north of Africa to its south and beyond. We will only be able to defend our bustling cities of the empire, its ports and its flourishing trade if we have a navy large enough to defend the coasts. Already, the British are saying their navies rule the waves. Let us prove that it is not so."
 GRA_sail_south_title: "Sail South"
 GRA_sail_south_desc: "With the recent discoveries of the Carribeans, and early communication with the native population there, reports from our diplomatic envoys reveal that there is an entire continent that we have yet to uncover - we should do this at once!" 
 GRA_brazil_title: "Juldin Miduz" 
 GRA_brazil_desc: "We have landed on a beach, with the treelines as far as the eye can see. The natives, wary of our presence, do not emerge from the vegetation. Perhaps, offers of gifts will ease their tension, and we will be free to set up colonies here. This new frontier will be the the launching point for our expeditions in the centuries to come."
 GRA_philosophy_title: "Ideologies of Ibn Arabi"
 GRA_philosophy_desc: "Ibn Arabi was an Andalusian scholar and mystic, regarded by many Sufis as the foremost spiritual master. His pantheistic philosophy of the 'unity of being' viewed all of creation as a manifestation of God, and invited worshippers to see divine beauty in all aspects of life, not merely in the traditional rituals of Islam. Perhaps he is right - the unique sufferance our great Andalusian empire maintains aligns with his ideology, and we could adapt this school of thought for all our people."
 GRA_great_scholars_title: "Greatest Scholars"
 GRA_great_scholars_desc: "With great prosperity and cultural enrichment comes great advances in knowledge and society. As our nation remains at the forefront of technology, we have been able to inspire leaps in science, history, geography, philosophy, and language. Our forebearance of groups following beliefs other than Islam has allowed scholars of many religions to peruse our libraries and seek their own enlightenment, producing the greatest scholars in the world, here in great Al-Andalus."
 GRA_almeria_title: "Sponsor the al-Ma'din"
 GRA_almeria_desc: "The Almaden mine accounts for the largest mercury deposits to our knowledge of the discovered world. It is no surprise then, that during the Christian occupation the mine had seen nothing but growth. One could say that the cinnabar found in Almaden is almost as valuable as gold itself, perhaps even more. The mine shall enter a newer, even greater period of growth under Muslim control."
 GRA_funduqs_title: "Trade in the Funduqs"
 GRA_funduqs_desc: "Centuries of Christian occupation and years of wars of reconquest have brought the once sprawling Andalusian trade to a halt. Let us garner some of our wealth, restore the funduqs (side-road inns) and once again funnel luxury goods through our lands."
 GRA_morocco_title: "Master of Morocco"
 GRA_morocco_desc: "From the bustling markets of Fez, to the tranquil gardens of Marrakech, the idyllic highlands of Tafilat to the calm beaches of Agadir. Morocco is a wondrous place to be, and an even greater place to have."
 GRA_tlemcen_title: "Take Tlemcen"
 GRA_tlemcen_desc: "Our relations with the Kingdom of Tlemcen have been uncertain for most of its existence. For most of it, we have been at odds with the Tlemceni sultans, competing over control of the Straits of Almeria which has been vital for our trade. It was only when the Marinids threatened Granadan and Tlemceni independence that there was friendly dialogue, and it has never been that way since. Now that we are no longer a small, stagnant nation we can eliminate these barriers entirely, and bring their people under our fold."
 GRA_colonialism_title: "Colonies In Motion"
 GRA_colonialism_desc: "With the colonisation efforts of the Americas truly under way, we must take a step back and let our people decide where they want to be. Although most of the first to embark followed the beliefs of Islam, there is growing confidence in the minorities we govern that they would be better off in the colonies. Who are we to stop them?"
 GRA_spread_our_faith_title: "Spread Our Faith"
 GRA_spread_our_faith_desc: "As our people venture out to the New World to make a new life for themselves, they will regularly mix with the local tribes. By now, the natives have a basic understanding of our beliefs and are more willing to cooperate with us, with some even converting to our faith. Islam is now rapidly spreading throughout the lands near and within our colonies."
 GRA_cash_crops_title: "Cash Crops"
 GRA_cash_crops_desc: "The need for manpower to support the rapid turnovers in the new world plantations of cotton, cocoa, tobacco and sugar, these so called 'cash crops' have established the need for a triangle trade - slaves from Africa shipped from the Ivory coast to the Carribean, and ships from the Carribean plantations to our home ports. With profits enormous and labour costs nigh neglible, these cash crops will bring us great wealth." 
 GRA_argentina_title: "Land of Silver"
 GRA_argentina_desc: "Much like our ventures into the gold mines of Brazil, the silver deposits amongst the many mineral deposits of the lands down south yield much whiter and brighter colours. They mention of silver presents given to our envoys by the natives, prompting naming of the region to be Argentina. Regardless, there is much we can exploit from these mineral deposits." 
 GRA_andeans_title: "'Ard Muluk al-Shams"
 GRA_andeans_desc: "As we navigate around South America, and our explorers traverse through the Amazon, we have encountered an empire calling themselves the Incans, and their king, the Sapa Inca. It is impressive that they have managed to build such an empire without any of the inventions that was previously thought to be necessary to achieve this feat. Road networks, fine textiles and great monuments show the skill and uniqueness of their culture." 
 GRA_literature_title: "Greatest Minds"
 GRA_literature_desc: "Great news, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! As a result of our progressive thinking, our diverse court and great religious sufferance, we have cultivated an era of learning for all our people. It is inevitable that illustrious Al-Andalus has produced the greatest scholars of the world, and we are all the better for it! Past, present and future - we are the shining beacon of knowledge!"
 GRA_mathematics_title: "Mathematics"
 GRA_mathematics_desc: "Our continued patronage of all pursuits of knowledge by the people of [Root.GetName] have led to all manner of innovations, none of which as monumental as the leaps in mathematics. The findings of our best scholars specialising in mathematics have advanced the scientific fields by hundreds of years, and their legacy will be etched into history forever." 
 GRA_workshops_title: "A Commercial Undertaking"
 GRA_workshops_desc: "The wealth of al-Andalus has long been seized from the Dar-ar-Islam. As such, this has lad to a commercial downturn between the Muslim states of Maghreb, Sahel and Iberia. This trend has since then been reversed, but make no mistake: restoring what's been lost will require our active involvement."
 GRA_new_silk_title: "Asp of Jerusalem"
 GRA_new_silk_desc: "The sericultural tradition of Andalusia dates as far back as 8th century. It is when the first Syrian immigrants brought the precious silk worm to Iberia, beginning an art that would survive to this day. Despite the spread of silkworm, and the collapse of trade routes, our silk is still a benchmark of quality and good taste. Let us keep it that way."
 GRA_manus_title: "Solidifying our Lead"
 GRA_manus_desc: "Having restored trade routes in Iberia and beyond as well as having once again spread the tales of the Andalusian across the Mediterranean, it is now time to found royal workshops and manufactories across the lands to solidify our lead once and for all."
 GRA_scholars_title: "Invite Scholars"
 GRA_scholars_desc: "The latest innovations coming from our institutions have garnered interest in foreign experts, intrigued by their methods of madness. While not everyone who arrives to learn will be successful in understanding these ways, some of them may be willing to offer their services to our court instead." 
 GRA_gather_the_ulema_title: "Gather the Ulema"
 GRA_gather_the_ulema_desc: "The Ulema hold a privileged role in Andalusia. While they are scholars and judges across the muslim world, here their competencies extend far beyond the realms of sunnah. Our scholars, beyond forming revolutionary fatwas, also study philosophy and question whether our current theology is fitting at all."
 GRA_the_fake_caliph_title: "The Fake Caliph"
 GRA_the_fake_caliph_desc: "In ages past, our predecessors used to rule the mighty Umayyad Caliphate, the successors to the pre-eminent Rashiduns. But like all good things, it had to come to an end. Indeed, the Umayyads were toppled by their subjects, the Abbasids, who proclaimed a new Caliphate. But the damage to the authority of the caliphs was already done. The shia Fatimids of Ifriqiyya too, have proclaimed themselves caliphs. In that situation it was only natural that the Cordoban remnant of Umayyads would claim the mantle as well. Well, isn't it ironic that all 3 states fell, with the Abbasids too being toppled and falling under control of the Mamluks. Let us seize these puppet and do away with those pretenders."
 GRA_restore_caliphate_title: "Khilafah Qurtubah"
 GRA_restore_caliphate_desc: "Having humiliated our rivals to power, it is time to once again proclaim a new Caliphate. This time under the faithful leadership of al-Andalus.

 GRA_jewish_communities_of_andalusia_title: "Capital of Judaism"
 GRA_jewish_communities_of_andalusia_desc: "Much like our predecessor states of Al-Andalus, tolerance is an inherent aspect of our society. Jewish dhimmis living under the Caliphate were allowed fewer rights than Muslims but were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe, and as such attracted Jews from all over Europe. As a result, Al-Andalus became the capital of Judaism despite status as a Muslim Caliphate. The religious freedom ensured by our laws enabled the Jewish communities to contribute to our society in all shapes and forms in a golden age of Jewish culture."
 GRA_mosaic_of_faiths_title: "Mosaic of Faiths"
 GRA_mosaic_of_faiths_desc: "Our nation is consumed by religious fervor. Faiths of all kinds can be found across our kingdom. From Christians, to Jews, to Muslims, and all the denominations between. Within this the greatest strength we've found is not to repress those of other faiths, but rather to embrace their beliefs and see that they are respected. That is what brought such great success to past leaders such as Abd-Ar-Rahman III. By following his example we can create a stable, and lasting, peace within our realm that displays what a world where the three faiths work in tandem might be like."
 GRA_the_mozarabic_culture_title: "Rise of the Mozarabs"
 GRA_the_mozarabic_culture_desc: "Our nation has never been one of just a single culture. We have always been a patchwork of peoples united under the ideals of what it means to be Iberian. With this fusion of cultures comes the Christians who adopted Muslim culture and dress, as well as those who converted to our faith. These Mozarabs are an integral part of our nation, as they do make up the vast majority of our population. As such, we should work to encourage these Mozarabs to achieve higher stations than they historically had opportunities to."

 GRA_volunteers_of_the_faith_adu_title: "Volunteers of the Faith"
 GRA_volunteers_of_the_faith_adu_desc: "The Volunteers of the Faith are a military institution of the Emirate of Granada, composed by soldiers recruited from Zenata Berbers who were exiled from the Marinid Sultanate, to defend the Emirate against the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula. Many of them volunteered because they saw the defense of Muslims as their religious duty. Although North African volunteers appear in the Iberian peninsula already in the 11th century under the term ghuzat, recruitment was expanded during the last years of Muhammad I's reign, and they were institutionalised and further expanded by his son Muhammad II al-Faqih. Over time, the Volunteers eclipsed Granada's indigenous troops and became its main military force, numbering 10,000 by the end of Muhammad II's rule."

 ME_Granada_Events.1.t: "Reconquest of al-Mawsat"
 ME_Granada_Events.1.d: "As the fertile, arable lands of southern Iberia that were once the symbol of prosperous Andalusian rule, the towns of al-Mawsat carry the remnants of al-Andalus. Our brothers and sisters in faith, though in hiding, numbered many, waiting for our return. With their liberation, more and more people are willing to take up arms againt those that oppressed them for generations, and free others that have suffered the same fate."
 ME_Granada_Events.1.a: "Praise Allah!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.3.t: "Reconquest of al-Xarq"
 ME_Granada_Events.3.d: "If we are to have any ambition towards the greater Mediterranean, we must first establish a foothold in it. The Catalan coastal range, as well as the ports traversing the length, are vital to maritime trade between our Kingdom and mercantile states dotting the Mediterranean Sea. By restoring Al-Xarq, our economy will flourish once more, and our newfound relations with the Genoese and Venice will become valuable assets to revitalise the wealth of our nation." 
 ME_Granada_Events.3.a: "The Levante is ours!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.4.t: "Reconquest of Gharb al-Andalus"
 ME_Granada_Events.4.d: "The western region of the core Andalusian realm was conquered by the Portuguese centuries ago, and it has been a distant dream to retake these lands ever since. Despite the majority of those living here are now Christians, it was clear their monarchs neglected their people, if the lackluster defenses were any sign. Restoration our control over these lands will bring them new hope, reignite our naval ambitions of past times!"
 ME_Granada_Events.4.a: "Praise Allah!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.5.t: "Reconquest of Al-Tagr Al-Awsat"
 ME_Granada_Events.5.d: "Despite our early successes, by no means does it bring any certainty to our control over the Iberian Peninsula. If we are to unite it, contol over the plains in Al-Tagr Al-Awsat is vital to unlock marching routes for our armies into northern Iberia. We have achieved that, and now we must push onwards. We cannot be complacent this time, and push the Christian courts out of the region. Set up defensive positions across the plains, and remain vigilant!"
 ME_Granada_Events.5.a: "The Middle Frontier, restored."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.6.t: "Reconquest of Al-Tagr al-A'la"
 ME_Granada_Events.6.d: "By now, a large portion of Iberia is within our hands, but we cannot yet rest. Already, the eyes of the rest of the Christian world are turning to us, wary of the resurgence of another Islamic kingdom within the Peninsula. If we are to protect ourselves from another crusade, we must fortify our borders within the mountains of Al-Tagar al-A'al. Perhaps in time, our northeast march will lead us deeper into Europe."
 ME_Granada_Events.6.a: "The Taifa of Saraqustra restored!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.7.t: "Reconquest of Al-Tagr al-Adna"
 ME_Granada_Events.7.d: "We have pushed the Portuguese back to their highland hideouts! The waterways along the Aveiro are great natural fortifications against enemy marches. With the reconquest of a majority of the former Portuguese lands, it is time to re-establish a strong rule over Al-Tagr al-Adna." 
 ME_Granada_Events.7.a: "The fate of Alburtughal decided!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.8.t: "At the Frontier"
 ME_Granada_Events.8.d: "The restoration of Al-Andalus is almost complete, and glory of the apex of Umayyad power once again flows through the cities of Iberia. It is clear the Christian kingdoms are no match for us any longer, and our grip over these lands gains strength with each passing day. However, we once made the mistake of allowing the remnants of Christian states to remain in the Peninsula, and we paid for it with several centuries of hardship and stagnation, with our faith decimated by the crusaders. Let us not make the same mistake again, and eliminate the last vestiges of the Christian kingdoms, once and for all!"
 ME_Granada_Events.8.a: "Brace yourselves, crusaders, your end is nigh!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.9.t: "The Fight for Survival"
 ME_Granada_Events.9.d: "Over the past few months, the usually thrifty Aragonese traders that frequent our ports in Garnatah have been slowly dwindling in number until they have all but evaporated. Not only this, we have been receiving reports from several border guards that they have spotted many reconnaissance parties coming and going as of late. The writing is clear on the wall - the Castilians are building to an offensive, and if we do not apply our full dedication to the inevitable conflict, then our future may be dire."
 ME_Granada_Events.9.a: "Full dedication!"
 ME_Granada_Events.9.b: "We have focuses elsewhere."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.10.t: "A Genoese Broker"
 ME_Granada_Events.10.d: "Perhaps because of Castilian aggression towards those in the Italian states, or the actions of their incapable ruler, for one reason or another, the Italian mercantile states are willing to fund our desperate war against Castile in exchange for some favours. They have almost given us free reign into their treasury, if it means we curb Castilian aggression and limit their ambitions in the Mediterranean. This will give us much needed funds to hire mercernaries to bolster our forces."
 ME_Granada_Events.10.a: "We will need as many as we possibly can get."
 ME_Granada_Events.10.b: "Let us not abuse their good will."
 ME_Granada_Events.10.c: "We will just mobilize our own population!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.11.t: "Enforcing Support in Times of Need"
 ME_Granada_Events.11.d: "We are at a key moment in time, a crossroads in our future. If we are to make certain of our triumph over the Christians, the factions that govern the Emirate must understand that they need to contribute to the war effort. They may think of this as a sacrifice, but once we are able to expand our borders, their influence will be able to spread much further than before. The favours that we gave them during our time of troubles should now be reciprocated, anyhow."
 ME_Granada_Events.11.a: "The Burghers owe us a ton."
 ME_Granada_Events.11.b: "We need the Emirs to contribute."
 ME_Granada_Events.11.c: "The Tithes of the Ulema will help us."
 ME_Granada_Events.11.e: "We don't need any!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.12.t: "The Pending Reclamation"
 ME_Granada_Events.12.d: "The 'Re-Conquista' may have been a glorious time for the Christian kingdoms in Iberia, enriching their royal coffers as they conquered the once glorious cities built by the Umayyads. For us it was a time of darkness and decadence, and now we are left with meagre land holdings. The loss of Lower Andalus, especially Qurtubah and Ishbiliyah, shining symbols of Andalusian culture central to the Islamic world ever since they were founded were irrevocable blows to Islam as a whole. Our claims are still strong on the region; OUR people, speaking OUR language and following OUR faith are still numerous, and if we choose to if feel we are capable, can press them." 
 ME_Granada_Events.12.a: "Let it be known: we will reclaim Andalus."
 ME_Granada_Events.12.b: "We cannot risk angering the Castilians."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.13.t: "Conflicts with Zayyanids"
 ME_Granada_Events.13.d: "Our relations with the Zayyinids ruling the Kingdom of Tlemcen have been uncertain for most of its existence. For most of it, we have been at odds with the Tlemceni sultans, competing over control of the Straits of Almeria which has been vital for our trade. It was only when the Marinids threatened Granadan and Tlemceni independence that there was friendly dialogue, and it has never been that way since. Now that we are no longer a small, stagnant nation we can choose to eliminate these barriers entirely and bring their people under our fold. Alternatively, after our show of strength against them, we can choose to once again join hands, but this time to unite against the impending Castilian threat against us and the North Africans alike."
 ME_Granada_Events.13.a: "Let us pursue our claims!"
 ME_Granada_Events.13.b: "We shall abandon our claims in hope of their support."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.14.t: "[From.GetName] abandons their claims."
 ME_Granada_Events.14.d: "The Emir of [From.GetName], after a brief show of strength against our forces, has offered an olive branch to our court. In a convincing argument, they say that they will abandon their conquest of our territories, citing that it was 'not the time to fight between Islamic brothers when there is a much larger, imposing threat north to us both'. They have obviously done this in the hopes that we will see reason and join up arms against the crusading Christians. What shall we do?"
 ME_Granada_Events.14.a: "Let us put our differences aside."
 ME_Granada_Events.14.b: "Fools!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.15.t: "[From.GetName] struggles against Crusaders"
 ME_Granada_Events.15.d: "What [From.GetName] has feared has come to pass -  the conflict with the Castilians has come to a head, and they are severely outnumbered on the battlefield. Right now they are holding on, staving off offensives from fortified positions in the Andalusian highlands, but they are stretched so thin that they may not hold on for much longer. If they fall, north Africa and the house of Zayyanids will be next. They previously extended an olive branch to us, and now it is time to repay their honour." 
 ME_Granada_Events.15.a: "We will help!"
 ME_Granada_Events.15.b: "We are too busy at the moment."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.16.t: "Berbers in Baleares"
 ME_Granada_Events.16.d: "The Balearic islands have been notorious raiding outposts for most of its existence, from the time of the Romans, to the Vandals, Visigoths, Franks, and even our own Umayyads. It would not be difficult to reinstall our own Berber raiding parties to threaten rival trading fleets and devastate their port cities. Settling them there may bring additional benefits..."
 ME_Granada_Events.16.a: "Welcome them."
 ME_Granada_Events.16.b: "They are vile raiders! What if they establish a raider colony?"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.17.t: "Flight of the Moriscos"
 ME_Granada_Events.17.d: "As the conflict between us and the Christians intensifies, the notoriously intolerant Castilians are cracking down on those who do not follow their faith, believing them to be at risk of being spies planted by our state. This is obviously drivel, but out of fear many Sephards are fleeing, with even more Moriscos fleeing into our borders. In their haste to evict them, we have received numerous wealthy individuals, as well as educated men and women that will fit nicely in some of the local administrations. Their loss is our gain!" 
 ME_Granada_Events.17.a: "Welcome them in [Root.Capital.GetName]!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.18.t: "Revival of the Mozarabic Culture"
 ME_Granada_Events.18.d: "Our nation has never been one of just a single culture. We have always been a patchwork of peoples united under the ideals of what it means to be Iberian. With this fusion of cultures comes the Christians and Jews who adopted Muslim culture and dress, as well as those who converted to our faith. These Mozarabs are an integral part of our nation, as they once made up the vast majority of the population under the Umayyad Caliphate, and again do so in our population. The assimilation of Romance vernacular and Arabic into a new Mozarabic tongue signifies their graciousness to accept our faith, and that the differences in each of our beliefs is not a threat. As such, we should work to encourage these Mozarabs to achieve higher stations than they historically had opportunities to." 
 ME_Granada_Events.18.a: "We await what the future holds."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.19.t: "Assimilation of the Mozarabic"
 ME_Granada_Events.19.d: "With the gradual adaptation of the unique cultures of Iberia with the prevalent Andalusian traditions and ideals into something greater, many of the people have begun to realise that we are not so different in our goals and dreams. Not only this, our freedom to practise in whatever beliefs our people wish has inadvertedly given many the opportunity to learn of ours and those of our faith to learn about others. Jews, Christians and Muslims alike have begun exchanging customs with each other, and over a period of a few generations has culminated a new, united Andalusian culture. This is a magnificent achievement for our glorious nation, and our united future looks bright."
 ME_Granada_Events.19.a: "Strength in unity!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.20.t: "The Sephardic Jews"
 ME_Granada_Events.20.d: "The Jewish diasporas have been a constant presence throughout Iberia for over a millenia, with their evidence of their residence in the region dating back to predate even Roman control of Hispania. The Sephardic Jews is a name dating back to the exile of the Jews, where it was adapted from the Hebrew word Sepharad referring to the Iberian Peninsula. Nonetheless, the Sephardic Jews came to prominence during the time of the Khilafah Qurtubah, despite dhimmi restrictions. Jews from all across Europe witnessing the flourishing of Jewish culture, arrived in Iberia culminating in the Golden Age of Jewish Culture. The eventual fall of each of the successive Muslim kingdoms in the coming centuries, to be replaced by intolerant Christian kingdoms would suppress the success of Jewish traditions.\n\nNow that our reconquest of Iberia is practically complete, and Christians flee the Peninsula into France and Italy, the Jews make up a large portion of the refugees fleeing destroyed towns into the larger cities. Our religious sufferance has never waned, and we aren't going to stop now."
 ME_Granada_Events.20.a: "Welcome them in [Granada_jewish_province_1.GetName]."
 ME_Granada_Events.20.b: "[Granada_jewish_province_2.GetName] invites them with open arms."
 ME_Granada_Events.20.c: "We are happy to have them in [Granada_jewish_province_3.GetName]"
 ME_Granada_Events.20.e: "We don't need them."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.21.t: "The Silk of Andalusia"
 ME_Granada_Events.21.d: "Silkworm cultivation was introduced in Al-Andalus in the 8th century; brought here when the Qaysis from Syria established themselves on the fertile plains of Al-Andalus. The adoption of this practice was widespread, but particularly high-quality silk was to be found in Qurtubah, Garnatah and Balansiyah, especially when the Umayyads financed the start of the tiraz industry, royal workshops where sumptuous textiles were made. Abd-er-Rahman II founded one of these workshops in the al-Qaysariyya of Qurtubah, located by the mosque. Its productions were very much acclaimed due to the beauty of its designs and the excellence of the materials used in the hands of highly qualified craftsmen.\n\nThese creations met the demands of a material for the manufacture of luxury clothes and accessories which bedecked the highest positions of Al-Andalus, like caliphs and emirs, mainly for ceremonial occasions and purposes. After the fall of the first Andalusian state, the expertise of textile craftsmen naturally came to Garnatah, where to date, our silk has grown to be unrivalled. Traders from the nearby mercantile Genoa, Venice and even the Byzantines have long been patrons of the silk produced in Al-Andalus - such is our hegemony over the silk trade in the Mediterranean. By directly supporting the textile industry here, traders from all across the known world will contend for our silk, and will enrich the Andalusian realm tremendously."
 ME_Granada_Events.21.a: "Let us embrace it wholeheartedly."
 ME_Granada_Events.21.b: "Only partially promote the silk workshops."
 ME_Granada_Events.21.c: "We don't need it."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.22.t: "The al-Ma'din Mine Needs Workers!" #why is the mission that triggers this called almeria :marisatired:
 ME_Granada_Events.22.d: "As we expand our financing of operations in and around the al-Ma'din Mine, there has been a growing number of vacancies in the day-to-day operations. As it stands, there are a number of ways we can fill in the required workers, but not everyone is particularly eager to get their hands dirty. Foreign investors may be a quick solution but will ask for a cut of the profits, or the dhimmi who cannot afford the jizya tax to pay it off this way or simply diverting city garrisons to the mine. We will have to make the choice ourselves - and convince whoever we decide is best. "
 ME_Granada_Events.22.a: "Invite a Foreign Company to deal with it."
 ME_Granada_Events.22.b: "Get the Dhimmi to 'pay their Jizya' that way."
 ME_Granada_Events.22.c: "Include the military."
 ME_Granada_Events.22.e: "The local laborers will do just fine."

 ME_Granada_Events.23.t: "The Amalgamation of Metals"
 ME_Granada_Events.23.d: "With settlers rushing to California as a result to extensive gold deposits in the region, the importance of Mercury mined from the Al-Madin Mine has been in increasing demand for gold prospectors. The mined mercury is used in amalgamation of the gold ore, resulting in a cleaner result and finer gold, substantially increasing both the total yield and quality of goods to be shipped back home. Naturally, a higher increase in quality will also attract greater attention, and as such has resulted in a spike of demand for the products of the al-Ma'din mine."
 ME_Granada_Events.23.a: "We will grow filthy rich!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.24.t: "Prestigious Silk Fabrics"
 ME_Granada_Events.24.d: "As the highest quality silk that can be found on this side of the world, the prestige of our silk fabrics and skill of our textile craftsmen is unrivalled. Traders from all corners of Europe and the Muslim world are here, keeping an eye our for the sale of our premium silk wares. For us, it is a luxury to be able to pick who we sell to; and it is an honour for whoever we shall offer it to, as silk from Garnatah is fit for emperors and caliphs alike."
 ME_Granada_Events.24.player: "We shall ask someone who may decide on their own - §Y[Granada_Target_Player_1.GetName]§!"
 ME_Granada_Events.24.a: "Let us offer it to the wealthy §Y[Granada_Target_1.GetName]§!"
 ME_Granada_Events.24.b: "§Y[Granada_Target_2.GetName]§! may not be as rich as [Granada_Target_1.GetName] but we favor them."
 ME_Granada_Events.24.c: "Folks over at §Y[Granada_Target_3.GetName]§! will pay us fine enough!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.25.t: "Prestigious Andalusian Silk"
 ME_Granada_Events.25.d: "Great news! By the grace of the [From.GetName]'s royal court, we have been chosen as the ones to gain access to the textiles produced by the silk workshops. While it is at a most premium price, the prestige that wearing these fabrics will bring is equally of worth."
 ME_Granada_Events.25.a: "I'll take your entire stock!"
 ME_Granada_Events.25.b: "We cannot afford it."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.26.t: "A Rising Star"
 ME_Granada_Events.26.d: "Rumours amongst our soldiers at battle front claim of a strong young man that has been steadily rising through the ranks, and has already reached the rank of general. They say he has eyes of a hawk, able to watch the entire battlefield and make intelligent strategic decisions even in the thick of the fighting. They also say he is unrivalled with the sword, defeating every opponent he has face, on and off the field. Time will tell if these claims are true." #the beginning of the umayyad restoration
 ME_Granada_Events.26.a: "We will watch their career with great interest."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.27.t: "One Amongst Many"
 ME_Granada_Events.27.d: "It seems to us, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], that the outrageous claims that our soldiers have been making have been at least partially true - the man has been able to pull of miraculous feats, able to push back a flanking cavalry charge with nought but his regiment. The retainers in our court seem to think he should be given a noble title, and it seems harmless to reward such courageous acts. He is one amongst many, and could even be the second coming of Khalid ibn al-Walid."
 ME_Granada_Events.27.a: "We need more people like him."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.28.t: "Surrounded by Loyal Men"
 ME_Granada_Events.28.d: "Ever since we have given the now illustrious general his noble title, those of his closest companionship have begun acting more like his retainers, tending to his every need and speaking as a representative for him when is not present. The location of his awarded estate in the capital has seen increased traffic in the recent months, with the masses clamouring to get a chance to see his face. Some have overdramatised his feats to the point of religious fervour, and it almost seems like they are worshipping him as the second coming of the Prophet Muhammad."
 ME_Granada_Events.28.a: "Conspicuous."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.29.t: "A False Pretender"
 ME_Granada_Events.29.d: "It seems the rationale for the excessive actions of the legendary general's retinue have finally been uncovered. They have begun to spread through the grapevine that this general is of a cadet branch of the legendary Umayyad dynasty that once brought Al-Andalus to a golden age. While we can neither refute or confirm these claims, some of the nobles have seen an opportunity to climb the ranks, and have begun attaching themselves to this Umayyad claimant. His following has now grown to the point of a full-sized division, and could threaten our authority over the army." 
 ME_Granada_Events.29.a: "Let's hope he gets nowhere."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.30.t: "A Day of Reckoning"
 ME_Granada_Events.30.d: "Blast! The man has turned against the throne! Citing his claim of Umayyad descent, he has gathered his loyal retinue and ordered to march upon our largest cities, in order to incite the biggest amount of unrest possible, and to spread word of a so called 'Umayyad Restoration Army'. There is no point in denying that the Umayyads of Qurtubah brought great prosperity to our ancestors, but the claim this man has as an Umayyad descendant is dubious at best. In spite of this, the people do not care, and they have long heard of his legendary feats of the battlefield. Numerous people from all walks of life are willing to support his cause, and are already shouting for the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to step down." 
 ME_Granada_Events.30.a: "Crush the False Pretender!"
 ME_Granada_Events.30.b: "The throne belongs to the Umayyad!"

 ME_Granada_Events.31.t: "Andalusian Erudites"
 ME_Granada_Events.31.d: "The prosperity of Al-Andalus and the flourishing of our Andalusi culture has attracted all manner of intellectual individuals to Qurtubah, transforming it into a cultural and intellectual centre. Already, our Library contains hundreds of thousands of copies of works translated from Greek to Arabic, Latin and Hebrew. The continued patronage of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] enables us to continue the legacy of great figures like Ziryab and Ibn Darraj al-Qastali. Not only this, our royal court and even local administrations are willing to employ learned men and women, erudites from all across Europe. Evidently, our relaxed laws and open-minded society brings a myriad of benefits to Andalusia, as many are even competing for the positions that would allow them access to our royal libraries.\n\nThe nations are chosen based on their §MPrestige§!, §MRelations§! with us and §MDiplomatic Reputation§!"  #If I had a dollar for every time tolerance was mentioned, I'd have 14 dollars
 ME_Granada_Events.31.a: "Bring the §Y[Granada_Recruitment_Target_1.GetAdjective]§! Scholars here!"
 ME_Granada_Events.31.b: "Cordoban Libraries await the minds of Bring the §Y[Granada_Recruitment_Target_2.GetName]§!."

 ME_Granada_Events.31.f: "The §Y[Granada_Recruitment_Target_5.GetAdjective]§! are the definition of Erudition."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.32.t: "A Scholar Chosen"
 ME_Granada_Events.32.d: "One of our most learned scholars who left our court in search of higher knowledge has recently been picked for a high position in the Andalusian education system, and has recently sent word to us that they were free to return to our court whenever they felt that they were satisfied. It seems that [From.GetName] really values erudition over all!" 
 ME_Granada_Events.32.a: "That's nice... I guess?"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.33.t: "The Works of Andalusian Scholars"
 ME_Granada_Events.33.d: "Ibn Arabi was an Andalusian scholar and mystic, regarded by many Sufis as the foremost spiritual master. His pantheistic philosophy of the 'unity of being' viewed all of creation as a manifestation of God, and invited worshippers to see divine beauty in all aspects of life, not merely in the traditional rituals of Islam. The unique sufferance our great Andalusian empire maintains aligns with his ideology, and we could adapt this school of thought for all our people. Many of our current scholars have adopted a similar free-thinking style of philosophy, unbound and unrestricted by the tenets and practices of our faith, allowing our people to undergo metamorphosis in reasoning and logic and create leaps in culture, science and mathematics."
 ME_Granada_Events.33.a: "Everyone could learn from our administration."
 ME_Granada_Events.33.b: "Our diplomats are known far and wide."
 ME_Granada_Events.33.c: "The 'Art of War' was written by an Andalusian, right?"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.34.t: "The Future of Andalusian Military"
 ME_Granada_Events.34.d: "With the downturn of Iberian conflicts and the reunification of the region, the need for such a large army is not as immediate anymore, allowing us to make possible reforms to the military, and enhance its quality at cost. We could possibly learn from the armies of the crusaders - after all, they did give us a run for several centuries. On the other hand, we can maintain the Caliphal army style that has brought our faith to such success in the past." 
 ME_Granada_Events.34.a: "I have made my choice."
 ME_Granada_Events.34.b: "We shall try to blend in with the Crusader Armies."
 ME_Granada_Events.34.c: "Traditional Army!"
 ME_Granada_Events.34.e: "I might think more."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.35.t: "Castel Rossello"
 ME_Granada_Events.35.d: "Our country tires of war. A struggle of religion and culture spanning almost a millenia over the Iberian lands has left our people yearning for peaceful times, that they have never learnt to live with. Castel Rossello, a hillside fortification, is a natural defensive pass that has seen conflicts not just involving Andalusians of the past, but numerous other civilisations. Before we decide our stance, taking control of Castel Rossello is a must. The French may feel we threaten their hegemony over Western Europe, and decide on a militaristic stance against us. Or perhaps, our ambitions stop before the Pyrenees Mountains, and we should start developing friendlier relations with our French neighbours."
 ME_Granada_Events.35.a: "Heathens! They will fall!"
 ME_Granada_Events.35.b: "We should seek amiable relations with the French."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.36.t: "[Root.GetName] Declares Support for Malayan Islam"
 ME_Granada_Events.36.d: "Since days immemorial, Hinduism and Buddhism used to hold the definitive dominance over the Nusantaran Religious Life. While seemingly undefeatable, the indianized way of life would begin to eventually give way to the encroaching faith of Islam, which has began to garner much popularity among the Malay Traders. Recently this trend has further accelerated, for a new powerful islamic player has entered the arena, seeking to spread its influence through wealth and religion. As it stands, it would seem that Islam in Nusantara is there to stay."  #:partyhat:
 ME_Granada_Events.36.a: "Future shines bright for that land."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.37.t: "A Faraway Contact Made"
 ME_Granada_Events.37.d: "It would seem that our brothers in the faith, the [From.GetAdjective] have discovered a brand new route from al-Andalus through South Africa and the Horn to the Malaccan Straits. With their declaration of support for the Islamization of Nusantara, they have sent several delegates, seeking amiable relations and close cooperation. An increasing amount of scholars from that far away land are flocking to our quite exotic court." #:partyhat:
 ME_Granada_Events.37.a: "Praise Allah!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.38.t: "The Second Caliphate of Cordoba"
 ME_Granada_Events.38.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it is finally time. After centuries of hardship and decadence, trials of faith and tribulations in under Christian crusades, decades of conflict and loss, we have finally restored what our Umayyad predecessors had once achieved - a united Al-Andalus under the watchful eye of the Caliph himself. We have shown Islam the strength of our nation, our courage and righteousness, and we have shown that our [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] rulers have not led us astray, even in the times where we question our faith. Our scholars are amongst the brightest in the world, most learned and the most at liberty to explore the tenets of the world. We have shown that our swords can defend Islam from crusading heathens, and that our pens can guide the people to an enlightened future, regardless of belief and culture.\n\nIt is time that we proclaim the Second Andalusian Caliphate - the Khilafah Qurtubah. Let an old name link us to the past and future, for we will learn from the past to grasp a new future."
 ME_Granada_Events.38.a: "Faith, sufferance and glory to the Khilafah Qurtubah!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.39.t: "The Translator Work in Al-Andalus"
 ME_Granada_Events.39.d: "The libraries of Granada contains hundreds of thousands of copies of works translated from Greek to Arabic, Latin and Hebrew. The continued patronage of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] enables us to continue the legacy of great figures like Ziryab and Ibn Darraj al-Qastali. With the recent spread of Renaissance throughout Europe, as well as being the foremost nation of intellect and education in both Islam and Western Europe as a whole, as a magnaminous nation, our translators have started producing new copies for our friends in the Islamic world, to ensure that everyone in Islam receives an equal opportunity to educate themselves."
 ME_Granada_Events.39.a: "We live in great times."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.40.t: "Capture of the Fake Caliph"
 ME_Granada_Events.40.d: "In ages past, our predecessors used to rule the mighty Umayyad Caliphate, the successors to the pre-eminent Rashiduns. But like all good things, it had to come to an end. Indeed, the Umayyads were toppled by their subjects, the Abbasids, who proclaimed a new Caliphate. But the damage to the authority of the caliphs was already done. The shia Fatimids of Ifriqiyya too, had proclaimed themselves caliphs. In that situation it was only natural that the Cordoban remnant of Umayyads would claim the mantle as well. There was irony in that all 3 Caliphal states fell, with the Abbasids too being toppled and falling under control of the Mamluks.\n\nWith the capture of the fake Caliph, we bring into the question the legitimacy of this puppeted Caliph by the Mamluk Sultanate. The rest of the Muslim world will surely once again recognise our claim to restore the Khilafah Qurtubah. Hopefully - we do not yet suffer the same fate once more." 
 ME_Granada_Events.40.a: "The Legitimacy of our Caliphate - restored."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.41.t: "Printing Centre"
 ME_Granada_Events.41.d: "As the knowledge of the printing press arrives in our borders from the German states, much like the revelations there, we are now able to print the Quran at an unimaginable pace. We should distribute these copies to the masses to strengthen our faith, lest we get caught up in a Reformation of our own. The first point of call should be in our capital; and to so so, we will need to fund a printing centre. This will both educate the most people, and very likely develop another great trade for our flourishing city."
 ME_Granada_Events.41.a: "Yes, make [Root.GetName] into a printing centre!"
 ME_Granada_Events.41.b: "We don't need it."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.42.t: "The Barbary Coast"
 ME_Granada_Events.42.d: "The tribes of North Africa have always been nomadic, looking for better places to settle than the harsh Saharan desert and the inhospitable highlands. Now that we have united most of their region, we have agreed to let them settle wherever they wish, even across the strait in Andalusia. The largest confederation in North Africa, the Zenatas, have steadily moved west across the centuries, and are now entering what was once Tlemceni lands. They are so numerous in fact, that the towns they are passing through and settling into are becoming so large that they are unable to support the new population numbers. We can either solve this by moving the Zenata Berbers once more, or fund the local Arab infrastructure instead." 
 ME_Granada_Events.42.a: "Favor the Zenata Berbers!"
 ME_Granada_Events.42.b: "Favor the Urban Arab Population!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.44.t: "Cash Crop Imports"
 ME_Granada_Events.44.d: "The need for manpower to support the rapid turnovers in the new world plantations of cotton, cocoa, tobacco and sugar, these so called 'cash crops' have established the need for a triangle trade - slaves from Africa shipped from the Ivory coast to the Carribean, and ships from the Carribean plantations to our home ports. These new goods imported into our markets have piqued the interest of local and foreign traders alike, and are fetching a premium price until their proper values can be determined by a moderated demand. With profits enormous and labour costs nigh neglible, these cash crops will bring us great wealth." 
 ME_Granada_Events.44.a: "Great News."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.45.t: "Unused. Don't ask why."
 ME_Granada_Events.45.d: "I hope you are not seeing this."
 ME_Granada_Events.45.a: "Sus."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.46.t: "A Mixed Military"
 ME_Granada_Events.46.d: "By over time adopting military doctrines brought into our standing armies from the western mercenaries we have employed, our battle strategies and army composition can be likened to those of the best in the Catholic European world, while also benefitting from the unity in our forces attributed to our Andalusian traditions. A mixed military doctrine aiming to combine the strengths and minimise the weaknesses will grant us military superiority over all." 
 ME_Granada_Events.46.a: "Embrace the Christian Formations!"
 ME_Granada_Events.46.b: "We can do without."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.47.t: "The End of the War"
 ME_Granada_Events.47.d: "The building tensions between us and the Castilians have finally bubbled past the surface and died down. Although our future is still uncertain, we are no longer standing upon a precarious precipice where it is do or die. We should now be able to wind down our martial stance in the country."
 ME_Granada_Events.47.a: "Alright."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.48.t: "A Religious Mission"
 ME_Granada_Events.48.d: "With colonial fervour in full swing, and our colonies in the new world interacting and assimilating with the locals, some of whom have converted to Muslim, our people have brought up the idea of sending religious envoys to tribal nations in sub-Saharan Africa as well. All along the western coast of Africa, we have set up outposts for our trading companies. Perhaps, we could use these ports to send missionaries and spread the Islamic faith to those who have not had the chance to convert. Of these nations, the ulema say that [Granada_that_target.GetName] is currently the most suitable." 
 ME_Granada_Events.48.a: "Then let us send a mission to [Granada_that_target.GetName]"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.49.t: "Strange Men Preaching..."
 ME_Granada_Events.49.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! The tribal chief residing near the border has witnessed strange men with their heads wrapped in some sort of fabric, and dressed in similar clothing that covers entire body. They mention the words that apparently mean 'Allah' and 'Prophet Muhammad', but we have no way to confirm if this is true or not. Many of the people have gathered out of curiosity, and this seems to be a signal for these strange men to preach in a broader manner. We must treat this situation with caution..."
 ME_Granada_Events.49.a: "Allow them!"
 ME_Granada_Events.49.b: "Do your best to have them expelled."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.50.t: "Push-back against the Preachers!"
 ME_Granada_Events.50.d: "Worrying news has arrived. The strange preachers, who we now learn from some of the people as 'Muslim missionary envoys' have drawn in and seemingly converted quite a large number of people in several local tribes. While some chieftains welcome this change, others have deemed it to be a threat to their personal authority over their own tribe and have taken drastic action. Small scale brawls between those who have conerted, and those who follow the chieftains have broken out in multiple places - not big enough for it to cause large scale unrest, but large enough to attract further attention from elsewhere." 
 ME_Granada_Events.50.a: "Put down those brawlers!"
 ME_Granada_Events.50.b: "Let them fight."
 
 ME_Granada_Events.51.t: "Muslim Delegation"
 ME_Granada_Events.51.d: "It seems, that they have finally dignified themselves to visit our court. Were it not for their peaceful disposition and interesting tenets of faith, we would be accusing them of inciting rebellions within our lands to make us easier to conquer. Shall we deem them worthy to enter the court and speak to you, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]? Or shall we turn them away after they deigned us irrelevant and did not come to us first?"
 ME_Granada_Events.51.a: "Let us welcome them as courtiers to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 ME_Granada_Events.51.b: "Out of my palace!"
 
 ME_Granada_Events.52.t: "The Conundrum"
 ME_Granada_Events.52.d: "These wise men of the [From.GetAdjective] Islamic faith have made interesting points about their beliefs, and pointed out that our tenets of living are not so incompatible with theirs. They have left the court, providing us with a few printed copies of what is called their 'Quran', telling us that many of our people have already found peace in their conversion to Islam, and that it would not be a stray thought for the court to do so as well..." 
 ME_Granada_Events.52.a: "An interesting encounter to be sure."
 ME_Granada_Events.52.b: "Those words do convince me..."
