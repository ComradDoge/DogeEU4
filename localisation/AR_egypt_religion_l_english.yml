 egypt_religion_religion_desc:0 "Kemeticism was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals that formed an integral part of ancient Egyptian culture. It centered on the Egyptians' interactions with many deities believed to be present in, and in control of the world. Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine powers by virtue of their positions."

Ra sent his son, Heru, who flew into the sky in the form of a winged sun disc. From the sky he could see all of Ra's enemies and he swooped down like a falcon and attacked so ferociously that they ran away. Heru was then given the town of Behedet for his efforts.\n\nBehedet did not deserve to be forgotten to the very sands it was built to withstand. Our efforts to restore it have now paid off, and it is with joy in our hearts that we stand before its restored gates one more."

 ar_egypt_kemetic_sutekh.desc:0 "The God Sutekh, master of the oases, lord of the desert and an agent of chaos itself, once lorded over the oasis of Dhakhla. Even before Egypt fell, his worship was always contentious, being a God treading a fine line between Ma'at and evil, and his temples were rare. While places such as the great temples at Ombos could serve as exceptions to this trend, it would not be an exaggeration to say that his worship has been continuously maligned.\n\nThe rebuilding of a temple such as the one in Dhakhla signals a reversal of such a tendency, and heralds a new age where Kings and Queens of Egypt may once more seek out the patronage of the God of chaos and change - as many of their great and illustrious predecessors have before."
 ar_egypt_kemetic_sutekh.a:0 "Praise Sutekh!"

An island of unmatched beauty fit only for one of the Gods' finest Goddess, it was the last of the numerous temples to close its doors, and was home to shrines to Aset as well as her husband Usir and son Heru.\n\nEven though it has been many sunrises since the last priest set foot in its halls, the great pylon and colonnades have been miraculously preserved - a feat some of our more faithful administrators attribute to Aset's very presence on the isle. Through toil and sweat, our artisans and masons have not only managed to restore the temple to its past glory, but even expand and beautify it."
 ar_egypt_kemetic_aset.a:0 "Praise Aset!"

 ar_egypt_kemetic_wsr.title:0 "Abdju Temple restored!"
 ar_egypt_kemetic_wsr.desc:0 "Abdju - or as the Greeks came to call it, Abydos, was once the beating heart of the cult to Usir. What was once a grand necropolis, a place of healing where the dead and the living would meet, has laid in ruins ever since the last temple to the Gods was shut. With the re-openings of Egypt's great houses of worship however, it was only a matter of time until Abdju received which it has been sorely lacking. Today, the great temple at Abdju opens its doos once more, welcoming pilgrims from all across the country, inviting them to once again bow before the great statue of Usir."

 ar_egypt_kemetic_amenra.desc:0 "The great temples of Waset dedicated to Amen-Ra, Mut and Khonsu, once cast a mighty shadow upon the Nile's waters. Masses of pilgrims, priests, nobles and - it is said - the Gods themselves along with the great Kings and Queens of the past would come from far and wide to prostrate themselves before the king of the Gods' statue. Incense, gold, silver and wine once stocked its great storehouses. But then, Egypt fell: first to the Persians, then to the Greeks, then the Romans, then the Arabs. Nothing remained but ruins as the inexorable march of time carried on, consigning what had once been Egypt's grandest monuments to legends and oblivion.\n\nHowever, as the old faith returned, so too did the will to restore what had once been a thriving house of faith. Under [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eyes did the final great work of the last years finally come to an end, and while much remains to be done to fully restore such a place to the grandeur it deserves, it is undoubtebly a promising start."

Egypt's former capital, then famed for its great white walls, artisans, docks and great necropolis, was also the home to the cult of Ptah, patron of artistans and craftsmen. The fact that his grand temple has been all but forgotten is travesty alone, but the real sin lies in it having been forgotten in the first place. This could not stand, and as such we have taken upon ourselves to restore Men-Nefer to it past glory.\n\nToday, the great temple stands proudly once more, its white gate standing ready to welcome offerings and the faithful alike."

As the Kemetic ways return however, we had a duty to honour this mighty deity. And honour it we did: Paym, once the beating heart of the crocodile cult, is once again the vibrant place of worship it deserves to be."

The scribe-God has undoubtebly lamented the loss of his shrine and priesthood, and we would have been fools to ignore his pleas. Through years of effort and hard labor, we have rebuilt a great home for his glory, a temple fit for a God, a domain made for the patron of all that is written.\n\nIncense, oil and beer once more decorates his altar. Sacred birds and baboons have returned, and the shrine's grand doors are once more opened for pilgrims to come and present their offerings to the ibis-headed deity."
