 dse_advisor_event.1.d: "$SUBJECT_TAXMAN$ ability to converse with the subjects to well that they decided out of their own volition to provide some of their own troops."
 dse_advisor_event.2.d: "After days of painstaking research by $RESEARCHER$, the fruit of his labour will give us an edge over our neighbours."
 dse_advisor_event.3.d: "With $ANTI_CORRUPTION_OFFICER$ work done, we have been able to have a completely clean ledger. It was found that advisor positions have been a bit overpayed.

 dse_advisor_event.11.d: "Why increase the supply amount when instead you could decrease the attrition rate that occurs within the army? If the army is conditioned on one meal a march they will get used to it. Or so $SUPPLIER$ says..."
 dse_advisor_event.12.d: "Cut cut cut...snip snip snip. Is all that can be heard when passing $FIELDSURGEON$ tent. While some may be squeamish, all are happy to be at the hands of $FIELDSURGEON$."
 dse_advisor_event.13.d: "It is no surprise that with $MERCENARYLEADER$ managing the local mercenary groups that those abroad have heard of the great conditions that mercenaries work here."
