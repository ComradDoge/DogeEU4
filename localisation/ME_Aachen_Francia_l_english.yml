 AAC_tall_title: "Control the Urbanization"

 ME_Aachen_Events.4.a: "Give him a steed of finest breed!"
 
 ME_Aachen_Events.5.t: "Frankish Dream"
 ME_Aachen_Events.5.d: "Charlemagne sat on his throne, the room empty and quiet. He suddenly sees you, standing in front of him, as if you appeared magically. Intially shocked, he recognises something about you after a moment, and looks upon you with wishful eyes, and speaks in a booming, regal voice. \"You are my descendent. You will reforge my empire. You will claim my throne, and you will rule a new Frankish Realm in my name.\" \nYou wake from your dream. It must have been a vision, it was so real. Charlemagne himself had given you purpose. You shall claim the title of Francia, and with it, set your claim to the world the Franks once controlled. The Frankish realm will be whole once again."
 ME_Aachen_Events.5.a: "Glory awaits us!"

 ME_Aachen_Events.7.d: "The Second Verdict of Verden has come down to your advice, after intense debate from both sides. Choose your words wisely."
 ME_Aachen_Events.7.a: "Just like Charlemagne did, set an example to the rebels, draconian in their worship of devil."
 ME_Aachen_Events.7.b: "Give mercy!"
 
 ME_Aachen_Events.8.t: "Revenge for Tours"
 ME_Aachen_Events.8.d: "Like the muslims once did to us with their great incursion, until the Battle of Tours, We shall do the same to them, raiding their borders and heartlands. A revenge centuries in the making, it has never been so sweet."
 ME_Aachen_Events.8.a: "At Last!"
 
 ME_Aachen_Events.10.t: "Kingdom of Jerusalem"
 ME_Aachen_Events.10.d: "My lord, with the conquest of Jerusalem, our quest is done. We should leave for our homelands at once. This does create a problem, however, how will we defend the holy land, so far away from our heartland? I do have an answer, my lord, if you will heed my advice. You should set up a march here, in the name of protecting the holy land. You can leave me here to manage it, of course."
 ME_Aachen_Events.10.a: "Excellent proposal."
 ME_Aachen_Events.10.b: "I disagree with that assessment."
 
 ME_Aachen_Events.11.t: "An Enticing Lineage"
 ME_Aachen_Events.11.d: "A interesting man has approached us with an interesting offer my lord. He says he can \"prove\" your relation to the great Charlemagne through a long line of cousins and bastard children, and create a document verifying it, if you wish. You could use it to usurp the name of Karling, my lord. As a ruler of Francia, it would be very fitting, wouldn't it?"
 ME_Aachen_Events.11.a: "By all means, let us make use of his \"services\"."
 ME_Aachen_Events.11.b: "We will forge a mightier lineage than the Karlings."

 FRX_idea_1: "The Capitularies"
 FRX_idea_1_desc: "The Capitularies were a series of laws and edicts passed by the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties. They varied vastly in content and purpose, but were ultimately highly effective in facilitating the administrative roles necessary to upkeep such an expansive realm."
 FRX_idea_2: "Repel the Saracens"
 FRX_idea_2_desc: "In 721, the Umayyad invasion was halted by the Frankish victory at the Battle of Toulouse, guaranteeing the sovereignty of Christendom for centuries to come. The threat of saracen incursion has once again appeared, though this time in the the East. We must rally the men to once again step up to become the bulwark of Christianity"
 FRX_idea_3: "Lessons of Charlemagne"
 FRX_idea_3_desc: "Under Charlemagne, the Frankish Empire found great military success on several fronts. This was in part due to the Carolingian strategy of emphasizing mobility and encouraging looting to buy the loyalty of his nobles. It has long since been the days of yore, but mobility and looting remain remarkably essential on the battlefield."
 FRX_idea_4: "Frankish Cavalry"
 FRX_idea_4_desc: "Frankish cavalry remained a formidable force in their time, not due to battlefield prowess in particular, but due to their great maneuverability. But we must ask: 'why not have both?'"

 FRX_idea_7_desc: "The rule of the Carolingians brought with it a flourishing of arts and literature within the Frankish Empire. History once again repeats itself; the stability of the Empire and the prosperity of its domain brings with it a new flourshing of culture. The zeitgeist of the Rebirth permeates society, and can be felt down to the lowliest peasant."
