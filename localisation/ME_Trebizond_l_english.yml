 TRE_georgian_diplomacy_title: "Georgian Diplomacy"
 TRE_georgian_diplomacy_desc: "The Georgian nation has long been a supporter of the Komnenos dynasty. They helped us to establish Trebizond as a powerbase during the tumultous civil wars and disasterous 4th Crusade. We must strengthen these bonds if we want to survive."
 TRE_look_to_the_west_title: "Look to the West"
 TRE_look_to_the_west_desc: "The Italians have long dominated the seas around Anatolia and have been looking for more ports in order to bring more trade from the Orient. We can mutually benefit from the importing of ideas from the west and the export of goods from the east."
 TRE_italian_banking_innovations_title: "Import Italian Banking"
 TRE_italian_banking_innovations_desc: "The Italians have perfected the art of banking, supplying much of the monarchs throughout Europe with money to fund their campaigns. By importing these innovations in money lending, we can also ensure a steady stream of money to fund our conquests."
 TRE_seek_russian_support_title: "Seek Orthodox Support"

 TRE_black_sea_fleet_title: "Black Sea Fleet"
 TRE_black_sea_fleet_desc: "With the Pontic Mountains to our back, Trebizond sits in a strong defensive position from land. However, we are very vulnerable to invasion from the sea. We must protect our shores."
 TRE_bring_theodoro_back_to_fold_title: "Theodoro's Allegiance"
 TRE_bring_theodoro_back_to_fold_desc: "Theodoro was once a loyal vassal to the Trebizond despotate. The years have drawn our nations apart and the ever present threat of the Saracen has distracted us from our brothers across the sea, but the ties run deep. Theodoro may be willing to accept vassalization in exchange for monitary benefits."
 TRE_black_sea_ports_title: "Black Sea Ports"
 TRE_black_sea_ports_desc: "The Black Sea has been a crossroads of trade for many generations. The Ottoman Empire threantens to turn the Black Sea into a personal lake. We must gain control of the trade in the region to ensure we can keep our fair share of the goods crossing the sea."
 TRE_proposition_for_genoa_title: "Proposition for Genoa"
 TRE_proposition_for_genoa_desc: "Genoa has controlled many of the Crimean port cities for many years; with the crumbling of the Byzantines, Genoa is having increasing trouble holding these far flung territories from the Turks and Tartars. Perhaps they would be willing to part with the territories in exchange for some money."
 TRE_phoenix_in_the_east_title: "Phoenix in the East"
 TRE_phoenix_in_the_east_desc: "Civil war and strife have dominated the Greek world for the centuries following the disruption of the 4th Crusade. With the ever-looming threat of a Turkish invasion, we cannot allow the petty squabbles of the past to divide us any longer.  If we wish to rise from the crumbling dust, we must unite our people."
 TRE_production_in_the_pontic_mountains_title: "Production in the Pontic"
 TRE_production_in_the_pontic_mountains_desc: "Long ago, Trebizond and the Pontic Mountains were important producers and traders of silk, silver, and copper. If we wish to restore our once mighty empire, we must invest in the production of our homeland."
 TRE_religious_reforms_title: "Religious Reforms"
 TRE_religious_reforms_desc: "The religious upheaval of the last milenium has deeply divided the remnants of the Roman Empire. If we are to finally recover, we must solve these issues so that we can be united in our resolve."
 TRE_metropolitan_of_trebizond_title: "Metropolitan of Trebizond"
 TRE_metropolitan_of_trebizond_desc: "The religious authority of Trebizond is in a precarious situation. Our national authority is heavily tied into our control over the clergy of our church. "
 TRE_ecumenical_patriarch_title: "Ecumenical Patriarch"
 TRE_ecumenical_patriarch_desc: "The Patriarch of Constantinople has been the head of the Orthodox Church and a source of authority for the Roman Emperors since the 5th Century. By bringing the Patriarch under our thumb, we can promote our religious hegemony over the region."
 TRE_pontic_army_title: "Pontic Army"
 TRE_pontic_army_desc: "The years have not been kind to our national army. Long periods of internal strife have led to the decay of our national army. Now in these desparate days, we can no longer afford to be complacent with our national defense. We must create a grand army to ensure our survival."
 TRE_war_with_turks_title: "War with the Turks"
 TRE_war_with_turks_desc: "The time has finally come. Trebizond has historically avoided outright war with the various Turkish states in Anatolia, but the Ottomans now threaten hegemony over the entire region. We must strike now if we have any hope of survival in the coming years."
 TRE_reunite_pontic_coast_title: "Reunite the Pontic Coast"
 TRE_reunite_pontic_coast_desc: "While Trebizond controls much of the Pontic coast, major port cities like Sinop lie outside of our current borders. Control over the whole region will allow us greater flexibility in defense and allow us to strike at the heart of Anatolia."
 TRE_across_the_mountains_title: "Across the Mountains"
 TRE_across_the_mountains_desc: "While the Pontic Mountains act as an excellent strategic barrier for the defense of Trebizond proper, the time has come to strike at the heart of Anatolia in order to reclaim the region for ourselves."
 TRE_claim_the_interior_title: "Claim the Interior"
 TRE_claim_the_interior_desc: "The interior of Anatolia was removed from the Greco-Christian world following the outfall of the Battle of Manzikert. Without the borderlands providing a secure source of population and protecting the valuable coastal plains of Anatolia, the Byzantine Empire quickly fell into disrepair and was never able to recover. We must regain these lands if we wish to restore the greatness we once held. "
 TRE_control_cilicia_title: "Control Cicilia"
 TRE_control_cilicia_desc: "The Cicillian Plains of southern Anatolia were once one of the most productive farmlands within Anatolia. With the coming of the Saracen, the region turned into one of the most contested pieces of land between the Christians and Muslims until the fall of the Crusader states.

 TRE_ponts_in_hiding_title: "Ponts in Hiding"
 TRE_ponts_in_hiding_desc: "Despite the years of Turkish rule, Ponts and Crypto-Greeks still represent much of the population of the Pontus. If we can encourage them to return to their roots, management of the area will be significantly eased."
 TRE_cappadocian_greeks_title: "Cappadocian Greeks"
 TRE_cappadocian_greeks_desc: "The Cappadocian Greeks are the remnants of the greek population that lived in central Anatolia before the arrival of the Turks. Between the rugged terrain and the underground network of cities and fortresses, they have managed to avoid conversion and elimination by the force of both the invading Turkish armies and Timur's deadly campaigns. If we can coax this population into recognizing our sovereignty, we can use them to resettle the area with a new greek majority."
 TRE_aegean_coast_title: "The Aegean Coast"
 TRE_aegean_coast_desc: "The many divets and sheltered harbors of the Aegean coast of Anatolia have, since antiquity, been home to many ports and cities. Control over this area is vital to ensure our continual growth as a rivived power, espeically on the high seas."
 TRE_our_aegean_sea_title: "Our Aegean Sea"
 TRE_our_aegean_sea_desc: "The Aegean Sea has been at the center of the Greek world for millennia, both acting as a conduit of trade and a barrier from invasion. When the Italians took many of the scattered islands and coastal cities in 1204, they struck at the core of the Byzatine world. We must restore these islands to our rule to ensure our protection from piracy and naval threats."
 TRE_komnenoi_restoration_title: "The Komnenoi Restoration"
 TRE_komnenoi_restoration_desc: "The Komnenos Dynasty led the Byzantine Empire through the first of the Crusades and recovered much of Anatolia from the Turkish menace.

 TRE_bulgarian_expansion_title: "Bulgarian Expansion"
 TRE_bulgarian_expansion_desc: "The Bulgarians sit on a very important defensive position for the Greek world. They control the mountainous barrier between Thrace proper and the northern Steppes and Danubian Plain. Holding this region is paraamount to the security of Constantinople and Greece."
 TRE_return_prosperity_to_greece_title: "Let Greece Prosper"
 TRE_return_prosperity_to_greece_desc: "The Greek homelands have been covered in the blood of our kin and enemies for too long. Between the Latins, Bulgarians, Slavs, and Turks, Greece has not been at peace for more than 200 years. We must restore peace and prosperity to the area in order to fully restore the power of the once great empire that stood at the shores of the Aegean."
 TRE_advance_our_Frontier_title: "Advance our Frontier"
 TRE_advance_our_Frontier_desc: "The lands within the Pontic Mountains are valueable defensive hinterlands to protect our capital on the coast. Control over the mountains is vital to the security of our capital from the constant invaders of the east."
 TRE_into_armenia_title: "Into Armenia"
 TRE_into_armenia_desc: "Armenia was historically one of the first states to convert to Christianity; now they stuggle to face waves of muslim invaders. Despite not holding to the same branch of Christianity as us, we can still lighten their burden."
 TRE_open_the_straits_title: "Open the Straits"
 TRE_open_the_straits_desc: "When the Ottoman Turks crossed into Europe for the first time, they gained control over the Hellespont and thus control over the Black Sea trade. Since then, the Turks have threatened to close the straits to Christian trade and cut-off Trebizond from the western world. We must reopen the straits if we wish to have free access to the sea."
 TRE_rise_from_the_ashes_title: "Rise from the Ashes"
 TRE_rise_from_the_ashes_desc: "We are now a mere stone's throw away from reclaiming Constantinople. While Trebizond had reliquished its Imperial claims long ago, it has become clear that the usurpers in the imperial capital cannot manage the empire. It is time to restore the Komnenos to the throne of the Roman Empire."
 TRE_reclaim_greece_title: "Reclaim Greece"
 TRE_reclaim_greece_desc: "With control over the Imperial capital, the natural expansion route now lies at the rest of the Greek homelands. It is finally time to reunite the Greek homelands under our rule."

 #Tooltips:
 ME_Trebizond_tooltips.1: "@FEO§Y[FEO.Country.GetName]§! might refuse vassalization if they slightly expanded.\n\nIf they refuse, our relations will be hurt and we will get a permanent claim against Theodoro. Furthermore, in the case of their acceptance, we will lose -25% vassal income for 50 years."
 ME_Trebizond_tooltips.1: "We will offer to buy Mantrega, Azov and Caffa off Genoa for 250 ducats."
 #Events:
 
 ME_Trebizond_Events.1.t: "An Offer to Theodoro"
 ME_Trebizond_Events.1.d: "Theodoro sits across the Black Sea on the Crimean Peninsula and acts as an important stopping point for trade coming around the Black Sea. Theodoro once acted as a vassal to the Komnenos Dynasty in Trebizond. With the increasing pressure on the goths, they may be willing to give up some of their independence for protection from the new threats to the south and north. How should we proceed?"
 ME_Trebizond_Events.1.a: "Offer them Vassalage"
 ME_Trebizond_Events.1.b: "This union of ours should end in a claim."

 ME_Trebizond_Events.2.b: "We shall refuse."
 
 ME_Trebizond_Events.3.t: "A Proposition for the Genoese"
 ME_Trebizond_Events.3.d: "The Turkish menace has gained an increasing amount of control over the straits that connect the Aegean and Black Sea. With this control, they have been increasingly strangling the old trading powers in the regions. Genoa has seen its colonial possessions come under increasing threat to the invasion by the Tatars and the Ottoman Empire. Perhaps we could take advantage of their fears to strengthen our hold over the Black Sea trade. Lining the pockets of the merchants in Genoa may be enough for them to reliquish control over these cities."
 ME_Trebizond_Events.3.a: "We shall do that"

 ME_Trebizond_Events.5.t: "Industry in the Pontic"
 ME_Trebizond_Events.5.d: "The Pontus was once a producer and trader of many goods. Its position at the end of the Silk Road gave it access to many markets, which allowed for a multitude of different industries to spring up in the area. With much of the trade from the east shut off, Trebizond must now specialize. Should we gamble on the fluctuating silver mines, rely on the Byzantine tradition of silk production, or focus on extracting copper?"
 ME_Trebizond_Events.5.a: "We should speculate on silver."
 ME_Trebizond_Events.5.b: "We should revive the art of sericulture"
 ME_Trebizond_Events.5.c: "We should reopen the copper mines."
 ME_Trebizond_Events.5.e: "Naval Supplies suit us best"
