Much like Carthegians and Ertruscans the Romans attempted to grind us into sand, make us part of the past and obliterate our existence and future. But the ones who will be lost to the sands of time shall not be us, but the Romans. Their disgusting empire collapsed under its own weight, they were assimilated by the 'savage' barbarians they fought in the war of survival.\n\nThe Germanic execution of Rome is appreciated, but their action to claim the mantle of Rome is perverse and disgusting, it's unacceptable. How dare they claim that title like it is something to be proud of? How dare they pretend to attempt to carry the legacy of such a wretched nation? Such mockery of the Celtic people is nothing but gross provocation, and we have answered this provocation. We have slaughtered their armies, razed their cities, swayed or occupied their capitals, the emperor is not only lucky to be alive, but also not within our grasp. For if we were to catch him he'd cry to the gods, but his cries would undoubtedly go unanswered. Rome is dead, the Holy Roman Empire is dead.
