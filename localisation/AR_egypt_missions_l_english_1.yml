 #Branching missions for faith

 ar_egypt_religious_crossroad_title:0 "At a Crossroad of Faiths"
 ar_egypt_religious_crossroad_desc:0 "Egypt has always stood as a crossroads of sorts between Pagans, Muslims, Jews and Christians. Our own faith being a minority here, we must now determine the direction our country will take spiritually."
 ar_egypt_religious_unknown_1_title:0 "Branching Mission"
 ar_egypt_religious_unknown_1_desc:0 "This mission can be unlocked by completing the §YCrossroad of Faiths§! mission and the following event chain."

 ar_egypt_religious_unknown_2_desc:0 "This mission can be unlocked by completing the §YCrossroad of Faiths§! mission and the following event chain."

 ar_egypt_religious_coptic_1_title:0 "A Coptic Egypt"
 ar_egypt_religious_coptic_1_desc:0 "Egypt has been the cradle of the Coptic faith. Let us restore that status, and reunite the valley under the banner of the Coptic faith!"
 ar_egypt_religious_coptic_2_title:0 "A Blessed Nation"
 ar_egypt_religious_coptic_2_desc:0 "Once more the Coptic people have found a home in Egypt and beyond, reuniting the disparate churches of the east under a single banner."

 ar_egypt_religious_catholic_1_title:0 "A Catholic Egypt"
 ar_egypt_religious_catholic_1_desc:0 "Egypt, the land of Moses, has been returned to the fold. Under our watch, it must never falter again - be it to Orthodox heretics or Muslim invaders. We will bring the Nile under the ever watchful eye of a new Cardinal."
 ar_egypt_religious_catholic_2_title:0 "Craddle of Christianity"
 ar_egypt_religious_catholic_2_desc:0 "Jerusalem is the beating heart of Christianity, and for centuries Popes, Kings and Emperors have longed to bring it under the fold of the Roman Church. We must be the ones to realise this vision."

 ar_egypt_religious_christian_1_title:0 "A Christian Egypt"
 ar_egypt_religious_christian_1_desc:0 "Egypt, the land of Moses, has been returned to the fold. Under our watch, it must never falter again - be it to Pagans or Muslim invaders. We will bring the Nile under the ever watchful eye of a renewed, christian nation."
 ar_egypt_religious_christian_2_title:0 "A Hallowed Land"
 ar_egypt_religious_christian_2_desc:0 "Only by assuming a dominant position over the region - both politically and spiritually - can we truly proclaim ourselves as the wardens of Christianity in the east."

 ar_egypt_religious_pagan_1_title:0 "A [Root.Religion.GetName] Nile"
 ar_egypt_religious_pagan_1_desc:0 "Egypt was always a sacred land. With our recent conquest of the valley's key cities, we can now move towards shifting the religious balance among our Egyptian provinces, establishing our own spiritual beliefs alongside the Nile's riverbanks."
 ar_egypt_religious_pagan_2_title:0 "Our Faith and Egypt"
 ar_egypt_religious_pagan_2_desc:0 "No matter its past, Egypt is now ours - politically and religiously. By bridging the gap between our own clergy and the valley's inhabitants, we have succeeded in making this nation our own."

 ar_egypt_religion_kemetic_1_title:0 "Priestly Institutions"
 ar_egypt_religion_kemetic_1_desc:0 "The Egyptian clergy was gutted - both by Hellenic neglect, and later Roman and Arab hostility. Only a few - if any - people can still speak the language of the Gods, and as a result our priesthood is little more than aspirant scholars, zealots and clueless enthusiasts. Re-establishing a proper, litterate clergy with the proper places of worship must be our top priority."
 ar_egypt_religion_kemetic_2_title:0 "Ta en Netjerw"
 ar_egypt_religion_kemetic_2_desc:0 "Egypt was know by many names in the days of the Old Kings: the black land, the two lands, the land of the river or simply Kemet. But it was viewed, primarily, as a land both belonging to and blessed by the Gods - a country whose beauty and exceptional geography could only be explained thanks to the loving attention of a multitude of deities. It is our duty to revere our benevolent Gods through the restoration of their earthly homes and the dedication monumental temples."

 ar_egypt_religion_neterist_1_title:0 "Foster Neterist Institutions"
 ar_egypt_religion_neterist_1_desc:0 "Neterism was - even in the time of the Ptolemies - a precrariously dominant religion. The ancient Egyptian religion and Greek traditionalism alike both were resistant to what was perceived as a thinly veiled attempt at purchasing the loyalty of the Egyptian people through religious bribery. By learning from our predecessors' struggles and dedicating resources to the Neterist clergy we can ensure that they will find it easier to attend to their duties."
 ar_egypt_religion_neterist_2_title:0 "Formalise the Royal Cult"
 ar_egypt_religion_neterist_2_desc:0 "Egypt was, for the vast majority of its time, ruled by monarchs who were viewed - or longed to be viewed - as God-Kings: sacrosanct figures of worship and absolute political power. While we are not of their blood, and even if times have changed, we can certainly draw some inspiration from these ideals, emulating these ideals for the benefit of our country."

 ar_egypt_own_provinces_egypt_religion_or_same_group.tooltip:0 "All provinces in in §YEgypt§! are owned by us and follow the §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§! or are in the §Y[Root.Religion.GetGroupName]§! religious group."
 
 #Aegyptos Mission
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_upper_Egypt_title:0 "Recover Upper Egypt"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_upper_Egypt_desc:0 "Upper Egypt may lack the great arable land and the sea-ports of the north, but it remains an integral part of our domain, both symbolically and economically. We must endeavour to secure the South, by all means necessary - and in doing so re-establish ourselves as the rightful rulers of the Nile."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_nubia_title:0 "Southern Claims"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_nubia_desc:0 "The lands to our immediate south hold untapped value both in manpower and in ressources. It also happens that we do possess some measure of a legitimate claim to the area. Recovering this area in its entirety and asserting our control over it will further solidify our position in the region."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_gold_mines_title:0 "Re-vitalise Gold Mining"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_gold_mines_desc:0 "Gold, once it flowed from the Egyptian land as the Nile does into the sea. The southernmost part of our domain contains many untapped deposits, and we would be fools to not exploit it. A heavy investment in the Nubian lands will assist us in uncovering long-forgotten gold mines - even though we would do well to tamper our expectations."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_pontic_claims_title:0 "Bithynia and Pontus"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_pontic_claims_desc:0 "The lands of Bithynia and Pontus were once Greek, later Roman, and the Ptolemies had staked a claim to it during their own golden era. As the rightful successors to the Greek empires in Aegyptos, we too shall lay claim to these lands and re-join these kingdoms with ours."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_legitimate_kingdom_title:0 "Legitimise the Kingdom"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_legitimate_kingdom_desc:0 "While we have assessed our territorial claims, we are still strangers in a strange land - and though we would find it desirable to secure the compliance of the Egyptian nobility, this has yet to come to pass. Through cultural intermingling and the resolution of our religious differences, we can begin working towards a more permanent solution."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_army_title:0 "An Army Fit for a King"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_army_desc:0 "Our army is quite not what we would want it to be. Our prolonged campaign to secure Egypt has stretched our armed forces to their limits. This however presents us with a unique opportunity; by taking advantage of our situation we may - through serious effort - reform our army into something passable."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_seleucids_claims_title:0 "Shadow of the Seleucids"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_seleucids_claims_desc:0 "The Seleucids, once mortal rivals of Aegyptos, fell as the Ptolemies did - consigned to the sands of Syria and Persia. We cannot let their heritage be spoilt by the Arab, Turkish or Persian jackals. These lands are ours by right, and we shall make a show of force for these upstarts, permanently establishing a Hellenic presence in the region."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_asia_minor_title:0 "Recover Asia Minor"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_asia_minor_desc:0 "Asia Minor was once home to countless Hellenic cities. Restoring our ruler over the land will put us in a stronger position by giving us a land bridge to Hellas, while also begining the return of Greek settlers to the region."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_free_greece_title:0 "Liberate Hellas"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_free_greece_desc:0 "Hellas has suffered greatly at the hands of the Latin and Turkish invaders, its carcasse plucked of wealth, its splendor all but eradicated. This cannot stand: for Greek people to be free, Hellas must be freed. Hellas must be returned to Hellenic hands - our hands."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_ptolemic_empire_title:0 "The Hellenic Empire"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_ptolemic_empire_desc:0 "Alexander's conquest and the following successor states triggered a civilisational change throughout Europe, Africa and Asia. While we are neither Macedonian nor Ptolemaic, we are Hellenic, and our impact too is felt worldwide: for the first time in centuries, a Hellenic empire dominates the Middle East. Though shall we aspire to it, this could be the mere stepping stone for something even greater..."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_lower_egypt_title:0 "Recover Lower Egypt"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_lower_egypt_desc:0 "Lower Egypt is a land of contrast: saline deserts, swamps, vast stretches of arable lands and coastal deserts. It has also always been  an integral part of our own domain - and we must ensure that it belongs to us in its entirety, from the Libyan sands to the Sinai's highest peak, from the city of Alexandria to the first buckle of the Delta."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_build_fleet_title:0 "Secure Naval Supremacy"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_build_fleet_desc:0 "While the Nile is unquestionably ours, the great sea beyond is not. Constructing a proper fleet is necessary to realise our ambitions however, and thus we should exert no small effort to dominate the waves."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_recover_cyprus_title:0 "Recover Cyprus"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_recover_cyprus_desc:0 "Cyprus rightfully belongs to us, and would also serve as a strategic outpost for our navy to stage an advance upon both Hellas but Italy as well. Capturing the island, placing it firmly under our control and fortifying it will satisfy this intermediate goal."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_hellenise_east_title:0 "Hellenise the East"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_hellenise_east_desc:0 "The adoption of Greek culture, religion, language and identity by the people of Syria and the Levant is a foregone conclusion, and one which is mutual beneficial to both the locals as well as it is to us, and a show of good faith will certainly assist in speeding up these efforts."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_hellenic_community_title:0 "Lingua Graeca"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_hellenic_community_desc:0 "From Alexandria to Byzantion, from Naples to Aleppo: all speak the tongue of Aristotle and Socrates. This truly is a Golden Era for Greek culture, the dawn of a Hellenic century. Let us make this Greek language the official language across all of our realm!"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_economic_reforms_title:0 "Reform our Economy"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_economic_reforms_desc:0 "While the lands of Egypt are undboubtedly wealthy, our own treasury is still rather lackluster. We shall work towards reforming our economy and fill our coffers."
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_granary_med_title:0 "Granary of the Mediterranean"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_granary_med_desc:0 "The nile is the breadbasket for all the Mediterranean: wheat, barley, chick peas - everything grows here. Through the development of the Delta's infrastructure and the consolidation of our hold over the Alexandrian market, we can boost our own production, ushering a vertiable agricultural renaissance across Lower Egypt."
 ar_egypt_5yearsGrainProduction:0 "We will gain §Y2§! years' worth of income from all our grain, cotton and sugar producing provinces.\n"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_magna_graecia_title:0 "Protect Magna Graecia"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_magna_graecia_desc:0 "Magna Graecia has always been rightful Greek land. It does not matter whether the Romans, Lombards, Italians or Iberians own it - these lands will be ours once again!"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_patronise_artists_title:0 "Patronise Artisans"
 ar_egypt_aegyptos_patronise_artists_desc:0 "Aegyptos was once the home to a thriving artistic community. And although the muslim and christian inhabitants which now populate these lands are undoubtlebly skilled, they are somewhat...lacking, something for which they can hardly be held accountable for, given the last centuries of warfare which ahve ravaged these lands. Me must reverse this trend, and bring forth a golden age for Hellenic culture and arts in Aegyptos!"
 
 #Kush Missions
 ar_egypt_kush_upper_egypt_title:0 "Recover Upper Egypt"
 ar_egypt_kush_upper_egypt_desc:0 "Upper Egypt may lack the great arable land and the sea-ports of the north, but it remains an integral part of our domain, both symbolically and economically. We must endeavor to secure the South, by all means necessary - and in doing so re-establish ourselves as the rightful rulers of the Nile."
 ar_egypt_kush_nubia_title:0 "Recover Nubia"
 ar_egypt_kush_nubia_desc:0 "The lands to our immediate south hold untapped value both in manpower and in resources. It also happens that we do possess some measure of a legitimate claim to the area. Recovering this area in its entirety and asserting our control over it will further solidify our position in the region."
 ar_egypt_kush_revitalise_mining_title:0 "Nubian Gold"
 ar_egypt_kush_revitalise_mining_desc:0 "Gold, once it flowed from the Egyptian land as the Nile does into the sea. The southernmost part of our domain contains many untapped deposits, and we would be fools to not exploit it. A heavy investment in the Nubian lands will assist us in uncovering long-forgotten gold mines - even though we would do well to tamper our expectations."
 ar_egypt_kush_egyptian_art_title:0 "Restore the Valley"
 ar_egypt_kush_egyptian_art_desc:0 "Under our rule, Egypt has prospered. By investing into the valley and capitalising on the growing wealth burgeoning alongside the Nile's riverbanks we can sow the seeds for a brighter, richer future for all of our subjects."
 ar_egypt_kush_legitimise_kingdom_title:0 "A New Dynasty"
 ar_egypt_kush_legitimise_kingdom_desc:0 "While we have assessed our territorial claims, we are still strangers in a strange land - and though we would find it desirable to secure the compliance of the Egyptian nobility, this has yet to come to pass. Through cultural intermingling and the resolution of our religious differences, we can begin working towards a more permanent solution."
 ar_egypt_kush_army_egypt_title:0 "An Army for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 ar_egypt_kush_army_egypt_desc:0 "Our army is quite not what we would want it to be. Our prolonged campaign to secure Egypt has stretched our armed forces to their limits. This however presents us with a unique opportunity; by taking advantage of our situation we may - through serious effort - reform our army into something passable."
 ar_egypt_kush_punish_levantites_title:0 "Punish the Levantites"
 ar_egypt_kush_punish_levantites_desc:0 "The Levantites' insolence must not go unaddressed: their constant raids, conquests, boasting and defiance has never been more deserving of our vengeance. From the Hyksos to the Mamluks, they have done naught but expasterate us at best. Let us remind them why they once paid tribute to our Kings and Queens."
 ar_egypt_kush_conquer_punt_title:0 "Conquer Punt"
 ar_egypt_kush_conquer_punt_desc:0 "To our south, in the lands now called Ethiopia and Arabia, was once located the mythical land of Punt - a land of myrrh, lapis and gold, of riches and gods. While the land of Punt is now but a memory, there is still much wealth and glory to be extracted from controlling to entrance to the Red Sea - and our ancient, historical claims to the reason is cause enough for conquest."
 ar_egypt_dominate_trade_horn_title:0 "The Gilded Horn"
 ar_egypt_dominate_trade_horn_desc:0 "The easternmost edge of Africa is richer than it appears, with the region's potential long squandered by bickering states and greedy warlords. Only by reunifying it under the rule of a strong nation - a nation such as ours - can the Horn hope for lasting piece, replacing the endless sectarian and secular conflicts to somewhat of an end."
 ar_egypt_kush_new_empire_egypt_title:0 "The Egyptian Empire"
 ar_egypt_kush_new_empire_egypt_desc:0 "From the ashes of an empire buried under the sands, we have risen anew: a contender reborn, standing proudly against the vultures which have pecked at our predecessors' carcasses for too long. We may now celebrate, for once more the Nile has become the base of a powerful and undoubtefully lasting empire whose legacy will never be determined by another."
 ar_egypt_kush_lower_egypt_title:0 "Recover Lower Egypt"
 ar_egypt_kush_lower_egypt_desc:0 "Lower Egypt is a land of contrast: saline deserts, swamps, vast stretches of arable lands and coastal deserts. It has also always been  an integral part of our own domain - and we must ensure that it belongs to us in its entirety, from the Libyan sands to the Sinai's highest peak, from the city of Alexandria to the first buckle of the Delta."
 ar_egypt_kush_fleet_title:0 "Brave the Wadj-Wer"
 ar_egypt_kush_fleet_desc:0 "Against all popular belief, Egyptians have had a long tradition of seafaring; from the days of Narmer, the Nile's inhabitants ventured on the Wadj-Wer - or Great Green - to the north and the east, building ports and settlements alongside the Mediterranean and Red seas' coasts. While we have little use for these routes, there are many new shores awaiting our arrival. Perhaps it is time for us to brave the waters once more..."
 ar_egypt_kush_destroy_rome_title:0 "End the Caeserites"
 ar_egypt_kush_destroy_rome_desc:0 "Rome has died, but its legacy has endured as an insult to our own heritage. This cannot stand. Rome must fall."
 ar_egypt_kush_economic_reforms_title:0 "Conduct a Census"
 ar_egypt_kush_economic_reforms_desc:0 "The ever-growing population of our realm has proven...difficult to accomodate, hampering any ability for us to pursue any more reforms to our economy and military. By holding a census, taking a stock of the goods and people in our country, we can lay the groundwork for any future endeavors."
 ar_egypt_kush_aegyptos_granary_med_title:0 "Nile's Bounty"
 ar_egypt_kush_aegyptos_granary_med_desc:0 "The nile is the breadbasket for all the Mediterranean: wheat, barley, chick peas - everything grows here. Through the development of the Delta's infrastructure and the consolidation of our hold over the Alexandrian market, we can boost our own production, ushering a vertiable agricultural renaissance across Lower Egypt."
 ar_egypt_kush_legacy_kadesh_title:0 "Legacy of Kadesh"
 ar_egypt_kush_legacy_kadesh_desc:0 "The battled of Kadesh was famous for being the first recorded instance of a peace treaty signed between two state parties. And yet, the Hittites are gone. Still...we have some measure of a legitimate claim to their old lands. Let us claim these provinces, bring them under our rule, as a homage to Rameses the Great and Muwatalli alike."
 ar_egypt_kush_legacy_destroy_assyria_title:0 "Masters of the Levant"
 ar_egypt_kush_legacy_destroy_assyria_desc:0 "Assyria was once a long standing rival of Egypt. However, they are now but a remnant, an echo, a pallid reflection of who they once were. We must secure the region for ourselves - restoring it under some capacity to serve as our bulwark againt Iranian and Anatolian invaders."
 ar_egypt_kush_patronise_artists_title:0 "Restore the Artisan Class"
 ar_egypt_kush_patronise_artists_desc:0 "Egypt was once the home to a thriving artistic community. And although the muslim and christian inhabitants which now populate these lands are undoubtlebly skilled, they are somewhat...lacking, something for which they can hardly be held accountable for, given the last centuries of warfare which ahve ravaged these lands. Me must reverse this trend, and bring forth a golden age for Egyptian culture and arts in Egypt!"
 ar_egypt_kush_beyond_the_horizon_title:0 "Beyond the Horizon"
 ar_egypt_kush_beyond_the_horizon_desc:0 "On the other side of the ocean lays the continent of India - or Bharat. While our differences may set us appart, we may find a common interest in the development of commercial enterprises. Luckily, the Egypt of old had a longstanding tradition of indirect rule - establishing local viziers to rule in its steed. This model may very well be profitable for our future expansion in the region."
 ar_egypt_kush_pharaohs_canal_title:0 "The Pharaohs' Madness"
 ar_egypt_kush_pharaohs_canal_desc:0 "The narrow land bridge connecting the Sinai to Egypt has been suggested to have once been the location of a canal connecting the Delta to the Red Sea. While such a project is...daunting - not to say madness - we do possess the know-how and manpower to do attempt its construction..."
