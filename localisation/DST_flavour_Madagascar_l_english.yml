 dse_flavour_madagascar.2.t: "A drink, your majesty?"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.2.d: "The sea is a fickle mistress. While she offers freedom in one of the purest senses, she can take it away on a whim, leaving men and women gaunt, tired and empty or full of passion and ambition. It is impossible to tell."

 dse_flavour_madagascar.3.t: "Stare in the Abyss"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.3.d: "The unexplored and unfathomable depths of the ocean call many. Perhaps, too many. There are times when even the strongest of wills want nothing more than diving as deep as they can. And, sometimes, they are rewarded… with treasures, sights beyond any earthly wonders, or death and insanity."

 dse_flavour_madagascar.4.t: "Foreign Competition"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.4.d: "It is no surprise that by opening our ports and seeking opportunities elsewhere with little regard to the who and the what for profit and adventure that others would do the same. Our country is a playground where citizens and foreigners enter veritable trade competitions! Some of the more conceited (but richer) ones are asking us to close some doors to protect their interests."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.4.o1: "Throw the doors open, let them see some sunlight!"

 dse_flavour_madagascar.5.t: "Two Hundred Thousand Hands"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.5.d: "While the Foloalindahy finds its origin in the army in the form of the “Hundred Thousand” soldiers of old, we have come to the conclusion that such an organised group under our command could accomplish much, much more. But what?"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.5.o1: "The earth, reshaped."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.5.o2: "Foundations put in place."

 dse_flavour_madagascar.6.o2: "We are part of it. All of us."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.6.o3: "There is no time to dwell on such things, back to work!."

 dse_flavour_madagascar.7.t: "The Hundred Thousand Tax"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.7.d: "We decide where the efforts of the Foloalindahy go, and with a wave of the hand, thousands are summoned to war and to labour. These soldiers and builders are the backbone of our power and are maintained by us, with support from the cities and nobles with a special tax that can be paid in goods, currency or services. Today is time to decide how it will be paid."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.7.o1: "Let the Faritany handle accommodations."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.7.o2: "Promote further military integration."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.7.o3: "We will oversee them directly."

 dse_flavour_madagascar.8.t: "Justice for one…"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.8.d: "The diversity of our country does not stop at its fauna and flora. It also encompasses the people that inhabit it as well. And with so many different cultures and foreigners, sometimes, it is difficult to have the law applied to all equally."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.8.o1: "...justice for all!"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.8.o2: "Issue privileges."

 dse_flavour_madagascar.9.t: "A look inward"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.9.d: "The tantalizing seas must wait for now. Men and women must return to the warm earth and its welcoming embrace. With it comes a lullaby, and we dream of the future. What do you dream of?"

 dse_flavour_madagascar.9.o2: "Our ancestors smile upon us!"

 dse_flavour_madagascar.10.t: "Petitions for Support"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.10.d: "With our eyes turned to the affairs of the realm and not outside ventures, it has come to our attention that several petitions for aid have been received. It appears that several were put aside, forgotten or simply were destroyed by negligence or malice. Recent efforts have been made to restore them, and now, it is high time to handle them."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.10.o1: "They can wait a little longer, no?"

 dse_flavour_madagascar.12.t: "A sickness like no other"
 dse_flavour_madagascar.12.d: "It is difficult to put into words, but, very often, our people are drawn to something intangible. Like a longing. Where they are means little: we have but one home, and even then, many feel like they do not have roots. Those that do refuse to leave our beautiful island."
 dse_flavour_madagascar.12.o1: "Uproot them all! The colonies will welcome them!"

 dse_flavour_madagascar.13.d: "Knowing where we are going, how we get there, and more importantly, what is being done in a given area is paramount for the continued development of our oversea territories.
