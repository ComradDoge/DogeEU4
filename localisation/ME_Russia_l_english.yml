 # Events:

 ME_Russia_Events.1.b: "Foreign Experts will help us root out this optimism about our unreliable army."
 
 ME_Russia_Events.2.t: "Reforming the Navy"
 ME_Russia_Events.2.d: "Russia was never a Naval power, but that doesn't mean it should ignore that aspect of a nation. Many patriotic Russians have suggested that by using our little knowledge and our vast manpower on the sea, we will overcome any obstacle. More sharp people on that subject suggest that we use foreign engineers and timber in order to modernize our Navy."
 ME_Russia_Events.2.a: "We can only win with the sailors of Mother Russia."

 ME_Russia_Events.3.t: "Reforming the Administration"
 ME_Russia_Events.3.d: "Ever since the Mongol Invasion of Russia, the administration was scattered. The nobles strong enough simply ignored their ruler, and thus, it led into great corruption.

 ME_Russia_Events.3.a: "Empowering the Boyars will benefit us the most."
 ME_Russia_Events.3.b: "We will not let the greedy Nobles turn the nation backwards!"
 
 ME_Russia_Events.4.t: "Reforming the Trade"
 ME_Russia_Events.4.d: "Many European traders have been impressed by the amount of goods we have within our borders and are willing to trade for it, with either money or their own Western goods."
 ME_Russia_Events.4.a: "The West will not get us addicted to stuff like Opium."
 ME_Russia_Events.4.b: "Trade is the only way we will survive against our enemies."
 
 ME_Russia_Events.5.t: "Reforming our Diplomats"
 ME_Russia_Events.5.d: "It is not uncommon to visit Moscow and see the people there start hating on your 'Tyrannic Western' look, and how they wish they helped Mother Russia when time was needed. Our Tsar has realized that this and is willing to become more open to towards them."
 ME_Russia_Events.5.a: "The West be damned! We will stand alone."
 ME_Russia_Events.5.b: "There is no need for petty hatred between us and the West."
 
 ME_Russia_Events.6.t: "Converting the Steppes"
 ME_Russia_Events.6.d: "With the last Tartar stronghold in our hand, their fate has been sealed. They will follow Mother Russia into every war, and they will also..."
 ME_Russia_Events.6.a: "...Follow the Orthodox religion without questions!"
 ME_Russia_Events.6.b: "...Be allowed to retain their independence."
 
 ME_Russia_Events.7.t: "Problem in the Steppes"

 ME_Russia_Events.7.b: "The more enslaved, the more obedient."
 ME_Russia_Events.7.c: "No one cares about the Steppes anyways."
 
 ME_Russia_Events.8.t: "Russia Asks for Support"
 ME_Russia_Events.8.d: "Russia has been into a devastating conflict with our Rival Sweden, and is asking for support. What should we do?"
 ME_Russia_Events.8.a: "Send them money!"
 ME_Russia_Events.8.b: "Send them Manpower!"
 ME_Russia_Events.8.c: "Send them nothing."
 
 ME_Russia_Events.9.t: "The Humiliation in Finland"
 ME_Russia_Events.9.d: "Everyone saw our nation as a Great Power in the Northern region. Recently, however, Russia was able to humiliate us in the dense forests of Finland. They ask us to withdraw our military from that region in order to establish peace."
 ME_Russia_Events.9.a: "The war is lost!"
 ME_Russia_Events.9.b: "No Step Back!"
 
 ME_Russia_Events.10.t: "The Great Northern War"
 ME_Russia_Events.10.d: "Our nation has been growing the last years. The problem though is that the Scandinavian warriors have been contesting our power in the Baltic. A Great Northern Conflict will end every ambition of them."
 ME_Russia_Events.10.a: "We shall humiliate the Scandinavians."
 ME_Russia_Events.10.b: "We cannot risk such a big conflict."
 
 ME_Russia_Events.11.t: "Westernization of Russia"
 ME_Russia_Events.11.d: "Russia for most of its time was known as the underdog of Europe, a nation without any qualities in their tactics or their administration. Many saw that weakness and wanted to exploit it in order to gain power for themselves. Now, the Russian Tsar has declared a new age for the Russian people, an age of revenge, glory, and modernization."

Now, all of that is over, and a new age has begun for Russia, an age of peace and prosperity."
 ME_Russia_Events.12.a: "They hide like cowards in their shell."
 
 ME_Russia_Events.13.t: "March into Warsaw"
 ME_Russia_Events.13.d: "With the Polish king defeated, the fate of the Polish culture lies at our hand. What shall we do?"
 ME_Russia_Events.13.a: "They are Slavic brothers. Let them have a voice in our nation."
 ME_Russia_Events.13.b: "Siberia is the perfect place for such scums."
 ME_Russia_Events.13.c: "No Polish shall be left alive!"
 
 ME_Russia_Events.14.t: "Failure at Finland"
 ME_Russia_Events.14.d: "10 Years of war, and yet no progress in Finland. This is truly a disaster for the Russian people as we suffer a great humiliation against an outnumbered foe!"
 ME_Russia_Events.14.a: "How Did We Let This Happen?"
 
 ME_Russia_Events.15.t: "Winter Palace Completed!"
 ME_Russia_Events.15.d: "It took us 30 months, but the Grand Palace of our Tsar has been finally built! May the rest of Europe know of our magnificence."
