 life_on_the_plateau_reform_desc: "After the decline of the Yuan Dynasty to our east, the authority in Tibet that the Mongols once had waned heavily and we were one of the bastions of Tibetan strength. Our dynasty created an autonomous Tibetan state and formally threw off the shackles of Mongol authority and it is because of this that many still flock to our banners."

 yak_provvision_reform_desc: "Domesticated yaks have been kept for thousands of years by our people, cultivating and improving our knowledge of their breeding will only make them more useful. In addition to pulling plows and being able to ride them, they give us their milk, fibre and meat, and carry a heavy load through deep snow. Their dried droppings are an important fuel, used all over Tibet, and is often the only fuel available on the high treeless Tibetan Plateau. Their butter is an ingredient of the butter tea that Tibetans consume in large quantities, and is also used in lamps and made into butter sculptures used in religious festivities. Their use is ever expanding with our knowledge and ingenuity."
