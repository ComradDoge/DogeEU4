 ME_Papal_State_Events.2.d: "Vast conquest brings a vast array of new subjects under the winning side. Certainly this has been a problems for many incapable monarchs ruling heathenish or corrupt regimes. However, as God's favorites, we never in fact suffered from such issues mainly because of the fact that our State has given equal opportunity to all Italians. Thus, each conquered state was efficiently integrated into our administration improving every aspect of it. The dilemma however still remains; Shall we embrace a completely new set of ideals and ways of function or shall we use the new cultures under our rule to improve our own ways?"
 ME_Papal_State_Events.2.a: "As do the times, so we must evolve and change."

 ME_Papal_State_Events.5.t: "Fate of Jerusalem"
 ME_Papal_State_Events.5.d: "Upon our rightful, just, and holy conquest of the former Kingdom of Jerusalem, we have been presented with the debacle of administration.

Alternatively, we could spare ourselves the hassle of policing the state by allowing some semblance of autonomy whilst still under our Godly guidance."
 ME_Papal_State_Events.5.a: "Let us restore the beacon of Christendom under our divine prosperity."

Their fall from grace will pave their path to damnation. Then the 189, in the service of Heaven, escorted the Pope to Castle Saint Angelo, saving him from a certain demise. Their Last Stand will allow us to continue the war."
 ME_Papal_State_Events.7.a: "Thy will be done."
