 persian_satrapy_long_desc: "A Satrapy is a mixture of a vassal and a colonial nation. It behaves like a vassal, but is less restricted in its diplomacy and has reduced liberty desire while paying tariffs like a colonial nation. It only joins its overlord's defensive wars, but the overlord can conscript troops from all Satrapies, which works similarly to the Daimyo's Sword Hunt. A Satrapy will automatically switch to a Republican Dictatorship. It can only be established by monarchies that are either §YPersia§! or a nation with the primary culture §YPersian§!, with a primary culture in the §YIranian§! group that is also their dominant culture, with a primary culture not in the §YIranian§! group but with any of them being the dominant culture as well as an accepted culture or with §YPersian§! as an accepted culture and at least §Y10§! Persian provinces. If it has it's capital in the same region as its overlord, a Satrapy does not cost a diplomatic relation. A Satrapy gains a reduction to culture conversion cost and primary culture advisor cost and gives its overlord a bonus to possible advisors and minimum autonomy in territories.\n"
