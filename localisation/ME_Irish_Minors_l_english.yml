 EE_Minor_IRI_Question_Laudabiliter_title: "Question the Laudabiliter"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Question_Laudabiliter_desc: "The Laudabiliter Papal Bull, on which the English base their right on Ireland, is the ultimate legal basis for our continued English problems. Many in the past sent letters of protest to the Holy Father in hopes of a revocation which never came. We should try our luck and see if we can get a different outcome."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Pale_title: "An Pháil"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Pale_desc: "With the Laudabiliter revoked, Ireland has finally been from the clutches of England. With the end of the 'Lordship of Ireland' a void has been left unattended, an authoritative void that needs to be filled by someone. Matters such as this aren't simply achieved through power but through diplomatic shrewdness and legitimacy. We should turn towards the Pope in order to gain the required casus belli."

 EE_Minor_IRI_King_Tara_title: "Tame the West"
 EE_Minor_IRI_King_Tara_desc: "Western Ireland is inhabited by the traditional Gaelic clanns who still hold the ancient Celtic customs sacred and dear. While their tradionalistic lifestyle is something we respect, staying true to Gaelic traditions has never unified Ireland and kept it shattered and disunited. A union under a new identity is something that should be tested."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Rally_Clans_title: "Rally the Clans"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Rally_Clans_desc: "With the 'Lordship of Ireland' growing weaker with time, the need of a strong leader in the Irish community is rising. We must rise up to the needs of the Irish people by firstly amassing a sizeable army."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Lost_Kingdom_Old_title: "The Lost Kingdom"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Lost_Kingdom_Old_desc: "The kingdom of Mide housed several High Kings of Ireland who played an instrumental role in the Gaelic history of Ireland, yet the Norman invasion from England put and end to this kingdom and it has been since that day an English possession. Newfound diplomatic success has brought the fate of this kingdom to the forefront of Irish affairs and as suitable candidates of the Irish throne we must act decisively by securing its seat in Dublin and all of its surroinding areas in the eastern coast of Ireland."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Lia_Fail_Foretold_title: "The Lia Fail Foretold"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Lia_Fail_Foretold_desc: "The stone of destiny of Lia Fail has an interesting mystical origin. It is believed to have been brought by the Tuatha De Danann and placed on top of the Hill of Tara. The significance of the destiny stone is very dear to our people. Many legends claim that the Lia Fail will roar with joy whenever a rightful High King of Ireland puts his feet on it. With all the achievements we have achieved thus far, let us approach the stone of destiny and hear its cries of joy once again."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Raid_Culture_title: "A Raid Culture"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Raid_Culture_desc: "Wealth and resources are hard to come by in the lands of Ireland. For this reason many clans have developed raiding tactics in order to gain cattle and many other types of valuables."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Creach_Righ_title: "Creach Righ"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Creach_Righ_desc: "Gaelic kings are looked upon as leaders and men of high status. In order to gain the respect of their people, Gaelic kings are expected to lead raiding parties and show tangible results on the field of battle."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Actions_Custom_title: "Actions of Custom"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Actions_Custom_desc: "Gaelic warfare has an important aspect in the life of Gaelic Ireland. Ritual combats in its singular or clannish fashions are present in the everyday life of an Irish person. Setting a dispute or merely to measure one's prowess, it was customary to challenge another individual warrior from the other army to ritual single combat to the death, while being cheered on by the opposing hosts."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Diplomacy_Amongst_Clans_title: "Diplomacy Amongst Clans"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Diplomacy_Amongst_Clans_desc: "The power of the sword has played a huge role in determing many outcomes throughout Irish history, however not everything should be settled by force. We should explore other diplomatic routes in order to gain a much benefitial outcome."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Grianan_title: "Grianan"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Grianan_desc: "Roundhouses and circular thatched roofs were the staple of Gaelic architecture. With time square and rectangular houses gradually started becoming more popular and by the 14th century replaced round buildings completely. Timber, wattle, and daub are the common resources used for building while stone houses were present in some areas. We should strive to increase the number of these stone structures inside our community."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Rath_Cathair_title: "Rath and Cathair"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Rath_Cathair_desc: "The Gaelic tradition of cattle raiding is very disastrous on economies that thrive on pastoralism. Defending our cattle should be of utmost importance and Ringforts are logically the best solution to this problem."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Maighin_Digona_title: "Maighin Digona"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Maighin_Digona_desc: "Nucleated settlements are a rare sight in Ireland due to the clannish nature of our society, yet some monasteries and trade hubs are becoming the heart of substantial settlements. Let us ride this wave of urbanization and create an Irish city like no other."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Vultures_East_title: "The Vultures of the East"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Vultures_East_desc: "England and Scotland monitor the situation in Ireland with greedful intent. With both these nations having many interests in Ireland a new dilema has risen; finding a way to block English and Scottish influence from spreading inside Ireland."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Center_Ireland_title: "The Center of Ireland"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Center_Ireland_desc: "Leinster spans from Dublin in the East to the heartlands of Ireland in the West. This geographic location has proved that we can very well become a virtual capital for all of Ireland to benefit from, while we benefit from the prestige that follows with this blessing."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Lord_Deputy_Ireland_title: "Lord Deputy of Ireland"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Lord_Deputy_Ireland_desc: "Our strong connections with England due to many reasons has given us a high status in the English court. Let us use this status in order to secure benefits for our nation."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Irish_Commerce_title: "Irish Commerce"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Irish_Commerce_desc: "The main source of income in the Irish economy is derived from commercial activities with England. Due to this monopolistic policies would serve best in further increasing our profits and controlling Irelandic affairs even more."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Gateway_Ireland_title: "Gateway to Ireland"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Gateway_Ireland_desc: "Our Southernmost location in the Irish isle has given us the privilege of being in contact with many nations in continental Europe. With the privilege in mind, we should build connections and relations in Europe in order to further push our needs."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Gallowglass_Septs_Ireland_title: "Gallowglass of Ireland"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Gallowglass_Septs_Ireland_desc: "Gallowglass are heavy infantry who are typically employed as elite guards of Gaelic nobility. These men are fierce in battle and their use as mercenaries is seeing an increased rise. We should focus our efforts on the Gallowglass and increase their value."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Burying_Hatchet_title: "Burying the Hatchet?"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Burying_Hatchet_desc: "Our relations with Scotland are confusing at best. With their conquest of Ulster fresh in the minds of our people Scotland is viewed as an invader, but our condontierri status with them has been steadly improving and increasing the mutual trust between our two nations. We should end this debacle and decide Scotland's status inside our court."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Irish_Navy_title: "An Irish Navy"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Irish_Navy_desc: "The region of Connacht is the least valuable region in all of Ireland due to its poorness. This poorness comes with its own benefits however, for we have the luxury of concentrating on non-militaristic matters. One matter of this scope can be the navy."

 EE_Minor_IRI_Connachtean_Overseas_Ambitions_title: "Overseas Ambitions"
 EE_Minor_IRI_Connachtean_Overseas_Ambitions_desc: "A unified Ireland has always been a dream of our leaders yet many rivals have stood as obstacles infront of this dream. Rumors of virgin untamed land to the West have rilled the interest of our leaders, a land with no rivals can surely mean a new home for the Irish people."

 # Events
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.1.t: "The Irish Dream"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.1.d: "The 12th century was a time of sadness for the Irish people. The arrival of the Anglo-Normans to the Irish isle brought an end to the last High King of Ireland. This English intrusion in Ireland started the 'Lordship of Ireland', a papal fief bestowed upon the English kings by the Holy See, via the Laudabiliter.\n\nMuch time has passed since the Laudabiliter Papal bull and English authority has waned to a small area around Dublin, known as Pale. With a weakened English grip over Ireland the time has come for Ireland to be once again united by a High King which will lead its people to unprecedented glory."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.1.OPT1: "Our time has come."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.1.OPT2: "We will gain the status of High King through a more direct approach."

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.3.t: "The Irish Power Struggle"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.3.d: "The struggle for the control of Ireland is a generational one where many clans have tried their best in securing kingship over the entirety of Ireland. Many in the past relied on their power alone but some relied on the shrewdness of diplomacy with England or Scotland to meet this end. Our ambition of claiming the Irish High Kingship is not a secret and it is up to us to decide which path we will take."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.3.OPT1: "We do not need any outside help."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.3.OPT2: "A friendship with the English and Scottish would be for the best."

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.4.t: "A New Remonstrance"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.4.d: "A papal letter sent to England in 1311 was written to remind the English of their responsibility to execute government for the welfare of Ireland, yet the English were not up for this task. Many years of misrule and abuse has lead the Gaelic people to yet again approach [PAP.Monarch.GetName] and ask for his direct intervention."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.4.OPT1: "We will not tolerate any forms of tyranny."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.4.OPT2: "We cannot damage our relations with England on a simple issue such as this."

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.5.t: "The Fate of the Pale"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.5.d: "With Dublin under our control, many have concluded that there is no point in continuing this fight. We have fulfilled our objective and thus we can simply send our peace terms to the enemy and negotiate the end of this war."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.5.OPT1: "With Dublin under our control, this war can finally draw to an end."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.5.OPT2: "We might be able to gain much more if we contine."

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.6.t: "Ileus, per quem Reges regnant?"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.6.d: "The newly created void that has been left with the retreat of English forces is in the mind of every Irish king. To fill such a void is an enormous task that can not be achieved through brute force alone. The Papacy has approached us and offered us the required legitimization of our Irish conquest if we swear fealty to the Catholic church."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.6.OPT1: "We shall be the sword of Catholicism in Ireland."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.6.OPT2: "We will never bend the knee to the Pope."

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.7.t: "Feis Temro"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.7.d: "The Feast of Tara was a pagan inauguration rite during which many High Kings of Ireland used it to denote lordship over their kindred and realms. With [Root.GetName] exploits echoing throughout Ireland, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to hold a grand feast in Tara in order to commemorate and celebrate these accomplishments. With the feast underway, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has given a speech during which he declared his intentions of uniting Ireland under his banner."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.7.OPT1: "We will unite Ireland under a single banner."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.7.OPT2: "What will continue the legacy of our forefathers."

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.12.OPT1: "Hidden"

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.13.t: "Combating External Threats"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.13.d: "Ireland faces many external threats that surround it from all sides. The Scots of the North have recently tried invading Ireland and they never try concealing their expansionist agenda of a Greater Scotia, whereas the English in the East consider Ireland a part of their domain due to the accursed Lordship which was given to them via a papal bull. Facing all these dangers simultaneously is a very difficult affair for many Irish tribes, due to their size, wealth and strength. A problem such as this requires the emergence of a new defender of the people of Ireland which will keep invaders at bay and assure its sovereignty."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.13.OPT1: "We will be the Aegis of Ireland." 
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.13.OPT2: "We can't be bothered with such a trival manner."

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.14.t: "A Call to Arms"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.14.d: "We have reserved news that one of the Irish clans has been attacked by a foreigner. Our status of Defender of Ireland compels us to intervene in the side of the defender."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.14.OPT1: "We will comply."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.14.OPT2: "We can't join the war at this time."

 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.15.t: "Hidden event"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.15.d: "Hidden"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.15.OPT1: "Hidden"
 
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.16.t: "Fate of the Pale"
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.16.d: "With the Pale firmly under Irish control and in respect to our failed attempts at restoring control over the area and its surroundings we have been offered a peace with the Irish for the low cost of ceding the province. This might be wise, as we do have tougher issues to face at the very moment."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.16.OPT1: "Very well, we will accept."
 EE_Irish_Minors_Events.16.OPT2: "The only pale the [From.GetAdjective] will receive is the paleness of their faces."
