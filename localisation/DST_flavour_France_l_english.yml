  dse_flavour_france.1.t: "At a Crossroads"
  dse_flavour_france.1.d: "The kingdom stands on the precipice of a significant decision, one that will shape its future and define the very nature of its governance. The monarch, surrounded by advisors and courtiers, faces a choice between two divergent paths: centralization and absolutism or decentralization and feudal contracts. For those advocating centralization and absolutism, the vision of a strong, unified France under the absolute rule of the monarch holds immense appeal. Embracing this path would entail consolidating power within the royal court, diminishing the influence of regional nobles, and reinforcing the authority of the crown. In contrast, proponents of decentralization and feudal contracts emphasize the importance of preserving regional identities and maintaining the ancient feudal system. They argue that by embracing a more decentralized approach, France can maintain a delicate balance between the crown and its vassals, granting them significant autonomy and preserving feudal privileges. Which path should France follow?"
