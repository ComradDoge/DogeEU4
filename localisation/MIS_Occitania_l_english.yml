occ_flavour_religious.1.t: "Cathar Manifesto"
occ_flavour_religious.1.d: "TODO"

occ_flavour_religious.2.t: "Cathar Pamphlet"
occ_flavour_religious.2.d: "News have reached our realm of worrisome news. First and foremost, the Pope's lands have been conquered. The Occitans have conquered and have begun concentrated effort of missionary work in the region.\n\nHowever, the most worrying part is what the Occitan officials have proclaimed and spread as they entered the conquered city. The 'Cathar Manifesto' as they call it, no more than a pamphlet really, speaks about the rot and wrongs that not only the Church has but all of Europe. Now the Church has issues but to proclaim what is tantamount to a declaration of war on everybody is ridiculous. It's more likely the Cathars wish to right the wrongs that they have suffered at the hands of the Catholic church centuries ago, and while we can't fault them for that, this development in Italy is an issue that might grow to large to deal with later."
occ_flavour_religious.2.o1: "Worrisome"
occ_flavour_religious.2.o2: "Pope deserved it..."


occ_flavour_religious.101.t: "Which City?"
occ_flavour_religious.101.d: "A landmass so large with complicated geography and even more so complicated history. It would be best to focus our conversion efforts from a single point but what should it be? \n\nRagusa is one of the options, a city of trade, allows us to make use of its existing infrastructure. Additionally, it is close to our lands in Italy, making it much less difficult to supply. However, the fact that it is so close poses a question - should we not focus on those that stray the furthest?\n\nAthens, a city of knowledge, with history that makes other seethe in envy. If we could get the scholars on our side and make use of the knowledge troves that exist there it might help our efforts.\n\nConstantinople, a city of desire? A city with wealth of both trade and knowledge. Perhaps this is the best candidate?"
