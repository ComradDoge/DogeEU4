 occ_flavour_religious.1.t: "Cathar Manifesto"
 occ_flavour_religious.1.d: "And so it has fallen. A source of evil. A source of hurt. A source of sin. For centuries we have toiled, for centuries we have suffered. Why? Just because we differed in our views?\n\nAnd what was the result of all that? Rome is now ours. It's people eyes are open to the truth. The Pope displaced. It's time to fix the wrongs. It's time to be more agressive in our missionary work. If these are the rules of this earthly prison, we will finally make use of it. Blame the Pope and all those who have hurt us.\n\nHencreforth, Occitania will proceed with increased efforts of missionary work.\n-Iberia will see a centre formed in Toledo. From it's central position the whole peninsula will be informed of the truth.\n-The Isles in the north will focus on the primary population centre of London. From there it will reach the majority of the population naturally. The rest of the Isles we will handle by sending new Missionaries.\nGermany will require a different approach due to it's fractured nature. Instead, we will focus on three main cities - Aachen, Frankfurt and Ulm. With these cities acting as the hub of work we will focus our efforts onwards.\n-Simillar to the Isles, the Scandinavian front will be formed in Sjaelland.\n-The Balkans, simillar to Germany will require us to possess three different cities. Due to the difficulties of the region we will require too chose which city our efforts will stem from.\n\nAfter that, the rest of the Europeans will have a choice. Join the truth or live with the lies. The rest of the world will not be left alone."
 occ_flavour_religious.1.o1: "In the end, it has come to this."
 
 occ_flavour_religious.2.t: "Cathar Pamphlet"
 occ_flavour_religious.2.d: "News have reached our realm of worrisome news. First and foremost, the Pope's lands have been conquered. The Occitans have conquered and have begun concentrated effort of missionary work in the region.\n\nHowever, the most worrying part is what the Occitan officials have proclaimed and spread as they entered the conquered city. The 'Cathar Manifesto' as they call it, no more than a pamphlet really, speaks about the rot and wrongs that not only the Church has but all of Europe. Now the Church has issues but to proclaim what is tantamount to a declaration of war on everybody is ridiculous. It's more likely the Cathars wish to right the wrongs that they have suffered at the hands of the Catholic church centuries ago, and while we can't fault them for that, this development in Italy is an issue that might grow to large to deal with later."
 occ_flavour_religious.2.o1: "Worrisome"
 occ_flavour_religious.2.o2: "Pope deserved it..."
 
 
 occ_flavour_religious.101.t: "Which City?"
 occ_flavour_religious.101.d: "A landmass so large with complicated geography and even more so complicated history. It would be best to focus our conversion efforts from a single point but what should it be? \n\nRagusa is one of the options, a city of trade, allows us to make use of its existing infrastructure. Additionally, it is close to our lands in Italy, making it much less difficult to supply. However, the fact that it is so close poses a question - should we not focus on those that stray the furthest?\n\nAthens, a city of knowledge, with history that makes other seethe in envy. If we could get the scholars on our side and make use of the knowledge troves that exist there it might help our efforts.\n\nConstantinople, a city of desire? A city with wealth of both trade and knowledge. Perhaps this is the best candidate?"

 occ_flavour_religious.101.o2: "§YAthens§!, a city of knowledge!"
