 CHG_ideas: "Chagatai Ideas"
 CHG_ideas_start: "Chagatai Traditions"
 CHG_ideas_bonus: "Chagatai Ambition"
 picking_up_the_pieces: "Picking up the Pieces"
 picking_up_the_pieces_desc: "The pieces of Central Asia are scattered and attempting to unite different places under themselves, but from our vantage point, we can see that it is all futile. Chagatai power is no where near what it used to be, but we must not be complacent with this situation! Chagatai power must and will be restored whether it be by diplomacy or by military authority!"
 unification_of_central_asia: "Unification of Central Asia"
 unification_of_central_asia_desc: "The great Mongol Empire is long gone and so is its most notable successor, the Yuan Dynasty. What remains in the wake of this breakup is a mess of sorts, but nothing that we can't remedy with by properly asserting and enforcing Mongol authority once again. It will be a long journey, but Central Asia will be our foundation for greater ambitions."
 modernize_and_adapt: "Modernize and Adapt"
 modernize_and_adapt_desc: "The age of Khans and cavalry armies are fading into the distant past and it seems obvious that the age of kings and queens, emperors and empresses, and dukes and duchesses are upon us. Chagatai leadership will need to adapt to outside forces influencing our society and our administration by not simply holding onto the traditions of the past forever, but by attempting to reform certain parts of the nation and make peace with what new technologies and concepts lay ahead."
 quick_and_vicious_movement: "Quick and Vicious Movement"
 quick_and_vicious_movement_desc: "Part of the traditions we were left with from the times of the Mongol Empire was the notion of quick and efficient movement of armies, though, most of them back then were composed of cavalry. Even so, today we can impart these ideas on our current military and move from places to place, town to town, and fortress to fortress much quicker than our enemies can."
 mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters: "Mediate Islam and Buddhist Encounters"
 mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters_desc: "The paths through Central Asia are filled not with either fully Buddhist nor fully Islamic communities, though, they do come in contact with each other quite frequently in Chagatai lands. By helping the two religions converse and debate with each other in a peaceful manner, we can ease tensions within Chagatai lands when it comes to religious differences."
 silk_road_trade: "Silk Road Trade"
 silk_road_trade_desc: "Trading with those of the Silk Road, even though it is far from what it used to be in the past, has helped the people of Chagatai prosper and learn of various ideas, including mercenary contracts. It should not be surprising that what we contribute to the Silk Road is also returned to us, just in a different and sometimes even better form, such as cheaper mercenaries."
 reform_the_mongol_empire: "Reform the Mongol Empire"
 reform_the_mongol_empire_desc: "The legacy is larger than life, some say; impossible to fully reclaim, as said by others. Ah, but these people do not know of the power within the Chagatai people, nor do they have the confidence. It will be a meticulous and time-consuming process, but through the blood of many and through times of both peace and war, those of the Chagatai nation will come to reclaim the mantle of the Mongol Empire!"
 NOG_ideas: "Nogai Ideas"
 NOG_ideas_start: "Nogai Traditions"
 NOG_ideas_bonus: "Nogai Ambition"
 confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols: "Confederation of Turkic and Mongol Tribes"
 confederation_of_turkic_and_mongols_desc: "The Nogai Horde was originally a gathering and eventual confederation of about 18 Turkic and Mongol tribes. They formed a powerful and distinct force in the Pontic-Caspian steppe and presented a serious challenge to regional authority from the likes of the Golden Horde."
 the_manghits: "The Manghits"
 the_manghits_desc: "The Manghits were a Mongol tribe that formed a foundational core for our people. Edigu, one of our more well known leaders, was himself of Manghit origin on his father's side and of Jochid origin on his mother's side, giving him more legitimacy in the eyes of the Nogai people. The Manghits are thus not only inspirational, they have legitimized themselves within the region and within the Nogai tribes."
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay: "Centralize the Nogai People"
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay_desc: "We can almost see the problems coming on the horizon, for our spread out population will undoubtedly lead to administrative issues later on. The Nogai people in different areas with little to no communication to a central authority of the Nogai Horde will be on their own, subjects to whomever comes through and seizes power. We simply can't allow this to happen; there must be communication and access throughout our lands so that we can relay information to the furthest ends of our realm with ease."
 weak_religious_institutions: "Weak Religious Institutions"
 weak_religious_institutions_desc: "Though we are technically Islamic in our foundation, there are little in the way of Mosques or other formal worshipping places throughout our land. Thus, if one travels across Nogai territory, they might not even realize that its people and its administration are Islamic, making us inadvertently more tolerant to both heretics and heathens."
 khanate_rivalries: "Khanate Rivals"
 khanate_rivalries_desc: "There are several petty khans in the vast Eurasian steppe that claim authority with what little military forces they control. The Nogai Horde, however, can actively challenge these claims to authority and fight them over legitimacy on the steppe that we inhabit. There may only be one with absolute authority out in our homeland, all others are and will be either rivals or subjects!"
 keep_nomadic_traditions: "Keep our Nomadic Traditions"
 keep_nomadic_traditions_desc: "Our nomadic origins aren't easy to change or get rid of; the act of raiding and pillaging hostile land and bringing back loot to our tribes is something we inherited and something we cannot and will not simply give up."
 fluid_political_organization: "Fluid Political Organization"
 fluid_political_organization_desc: "Due to our spread out population and vast, open territory, politics in the Nogai Horde is much more akin to that of flowing water that rarely impeded by blockages, whereas we see kingdoms and empires around us that encounter countless issues with centralized governments and numerous advisors. If anything, the way we conduct our politics will help keep our people loyal and content."
 OIR_ideas: "Oirat Ideas"
 OIR_ideas_start: "Oirat Traditions"
 OIR_ideas_bonus: "Oirat Ambition"
 four_major_tribes: "Four Major Tribes"
 four_major_tribes_desc: "The Oirat Horde is dominated by four tribes: the Dzungar, the Torghut, the Dorbet, and the Khoshut. The unification of these tribes means that military matters are able to be handled separately and with both grace and efficiency; we must work to keep these four united and working together so that our power does not wane."
 memory_of_temujin: "Memories of Temujin"
 memory_of_temujin_desc: "Temujin Ghengis made the world tremble before him and his cavalry, but before he ventured out of the region of Mongolia, he first had to contend with various Mongol tribes, such as those that now make up the Oirat Horde. We still hold the memories of the 13th century conquests as something to retrace and the legacy that it left behind, something to be tamed once more... Who else but the Oirat people could see to it that these memories are made a reality once more?"
 ming_rivalry: "Ming Rivalry"
 ming_rivalry_desc: "Our rivalry with the imposters down south, the so-called, 'Ming Dynasty', is nothing short of being on the verge of war at every moment. They desecrated and forced back our Mongolian relatives and now proclaim to be entering into an age of renewed strength, but little do they know that dissenters are spread far and wide throughout Zhongguo (China)! We will take these dissenters and rebels into our ranks and train them ourselves so that we may field them against the Ming Dynasty when war comes upon us."
 fall_of_the_yuan: "Fall of the Yuan Dynasty"
 fall_of_the_yuan_desc: "Founded by Kublai Khan in 1272 and driven out by the Red Turban Rebellion by 1370, then Yuan Dynasty was perhaps the greatest successor to the Mongol Empire established by Temujin. The Oirat Horde are the only serious claimant that might still hold enough power to retake the land the Yuan Dynasty once had. Should the heavens favor us in this endeavor, we can proclaim as the true successors to the Yuan Dynasty and forever seal away the likes of the Ming Dynasty."
 past_the_great_wall: "Past the Great Wall"
 past_the_great_wall_desc: "The Hongwu Emperor and the Yongle Emperor sought to rebuild and revamp the Great Wall in the late 14th century/early 15th century in order to keep the threat of us at bay, but we are nothing if not clever in finding ways around these defenses (or perhaps instead, through these defenses). We will innovate and adjust our tactics to ensure that these fortifications along the north do not stop the horde of cavalry from storming south into the heartland of Zhongguo."
 religious_indifference: "Religious Indifference"
 religious_indifference_desc: "If there is something to be said about religion in the Oirat Horde, it is that it is quite open and free from persecution. We have our own faith, but it is not expected of others to convert and learn of our traditions from the ground up, that would only instill unrest and distrust in people. Rather, a fair amount of religious indifference is key to keeping our people united."
 unification_of_the_mongols: "Unification of the Mongols"
 unification_of_the_mongols_desc: "The Mongols are not simply content with being divided up by foreign powers and pushed back to the steppe. The Oirat Horde retains the ambition to unite the several scattered Mongol tribes into one grand empire that can make the world bow beneath it, and it is the Oirat Horde that shall make this happen."
 SHY_ideas: "Uzbek Ideas"
 SHY_ideas_start: "Uzbek Traditions"
 SHY_ideas_bonus: "Uzbek Ambition"
 reign_over_many_tribes: "Rulership over several Tribes"
 reign_over_many_tribes_desc: "The vast part of the steppe that we claim as the Uzbek domain is full of different tribes whose loyalty, at times, is questionable at best. They do, however, have connection toward different regions where different rulers and khans live; through these tribal ties, we can bolster our own name and reputation from the ground up."
 degrading_golden_horde_influence: "Fall of the Golden Horde"
 degrading_golden_horde_influence_desc: "Authority from the west is no longer what it used to be. The Slavic people of Muscovy and Novgorod are actively making attempts to take over what land was part of the Golden Horde, similar to us in the east. The waning authority also gives us more freedom to govern our realm as we see fit; we no longer need to pay tribute or service to a ruler from so far away in the west who was often dealing with much more pressing matters."
 contest_over_southern_lands: "Southern Conflicts"
 contest_over_southern_lands_desc: "Land in Transoxiana was always rightfully part of the greater Shaybanid domain, but the likes of Timur and his people contested these claims and sought to tear it away. If we are to keep our claim to being the rightful heir the Shaybanid domain, these conflicts in the south must result in Uzbek victory in time."
 settle_issues_with_tribes: "Settle our Internal Issues"
 settle_issues_with_tribes_desc: "The many tribes within the Shaybanid domain are not always peaceful and often times disputes between them, or disputes with them and the governing body, result in often bloody feuds that can destabilize entire parts of our nation. It is time that we organize formal places (buildings, perhaps) where representatives or leaders of tribes meet to discuss and mediate problems they have with each other. The results are bound to shed less blood, much less than prior ones before, at least."
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain: "Consolidate the Shaybanid Domain"
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain_desc: "The vast stretches of land we rule across have towns and villages dotting the landscape. They may be few and far between, but we can make them the starting points of proper Uzbek settlments that we can either properly tax or draft soldiers from. It is a matter of centralization over decentralization."
 abulkharids: "The Abulkharids"
 abulkharids_desc: "The Abulkharids are a distinct branch of the larger Shaybanid Dynasty and one of its most famous rulers, Abu'l-Khayr Khan, helped solidify Uzbek dominance across the larger Shaybanid domain. It is through the Abulkharids that we find a solid foundation for unity and strength, and it is by them that at least part of our people are held together."
 ascend_from_nomadic_life: "Ascend from Nomadic Life"
 ascend_from_nomadic_life_desc: "The way of the steppe nomads is not what is used to be. Increasingly there are institutions and nations propagating said institutions that chip away at the foundation of our ancestors way of life. Perhaps it is time for the Uzbek people to settle down and start a new life as a more agrarian people, rather than a nomadic people."
 JIN_ideas: "Jin Ideas"
 JIN_ideas_start: "Jin Traditions"
 JIN_ideas_bonus:  "Jin Ambition"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms_desc: "Throughout the mid-2nd century, the Sima Clan made its way through the administrative structure of the dominant Wei Kingdom and effectively seized control of the throne of Wei in 266 via Sima Yan. After this, the Jin Dynasty became a dominant force in Chinese affairs and the last bastion of resistance, that of Eastern Wu, was conquered in 280. It is through this legacy that we again can rise to prominence and prestige should warfare fail us."
 lodged_administrative_divisions: "Lodged Administrative Divisions"
 lodged_administrative_divisions_desc: "A key feature of the Jin Dynasty was that of the administrative divisions developed by the Eastern Jin. They not helped govern some of the more hard-to-reach places of Southern China, but they also helped structure the government of the Jin Dynasty in a way that helped alleviate pressure from different internal sources. It would do us good to bring back these administrative divisions so that we too can profit from a more refined form of government."
 battle_against_former_qin: "The Former Qin"
 battle_against_former_qin_desc: "The Former Qin was the main opposition to the Eastern Jin from about 351 - 394, up until the Battle of the Fei River (383). Such a victory for the Jin Dynasty not only helped with legitimacy, but it also secured the rest of China from the imposters. We would do well to remember this battle and this victory well, for it was perhaps one of our greatest moments in history."
 manipulation_of_taoism: "Manipulate Taoism"
 manipulation_of_taoism_desc: "Taoism is often present in more rural communities around China, whereas Confucianism is seen to be present in the administrative structure of China. Just as our ancestors did, we should take a keen interest in Taoism and how it helps run these more rural societies for, if we can manipulate the people through Taoism (and vice-versa), we can ensure that our outskirts are stable and secure."
 war_of_the_eight_princes: "War of the Eight Princes"
 war_of_the_eight_princes_desc: "The period of civil rebellion from 291 to 306, known to us as the 'War of the Eight Princes', took place due to contention over the regency of Emperor Hui of Jin (he was developmentally disabled). Though this period was not filled with constant warfare as there was indeed periods of peace, it did cause a great amount of devasation to the heartland of the Jin Dynasty. We need to ensure that a succession struggle like this does not happen again and to mediate any future succession disputes before they reach our throne."
 the_five_barbarians: "The Five Barbarians"
 the_five_barbarians_desc: "Those that came through and overthrew the Western Jin, they defiled us once before but we will never let this happen again. The ensuing chaos that was partly caused by the invasion of the Five Barbarians resulted in the formation of the Eastern Jin and a subsequent loss in power for the Jin Dynasty as a whole, yet, we recovered from this and drove back the barbarians back toward the north. We must take this lesson from our past and keep it close to us and never again let those barbarians enter China again."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 SHU_ideas: "Shu Ideas"
 SHU_ideas_start: "Shu Traditions"
 SHU_ideas_bonus: "Shu Ambition"
 ancient_shu_state: "Ancient Shu State"
 ancient_shu_state_desc: "Long ago, the people of the Sichuan Basin formed an independent kingdom and remained independent up until they were annexed by the Qin state (precursor to the Qin Dynasty). Our people have not forgotten that their heritage stretched so far back and is distinct from those outside of the Sichuan Basin nor have others around China."
 shu_han: "Shu Han"
 shu_han_desc: "Liu Bei of the Three Kingdoms period declared the state of Shu the rightful successor to the Han Dynasty, giving it more legitimacy in the eyes of those who were loyal to the Han Dynasty at the time. We have not forgotten this proclamation and even though the Han Dynasty is but a mere chapter in the history of China, we still see ourselves as the rightful and legitimate rulers of China."
 three_kingdoms_period_shu: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_shu_desc: "Pivotal in the history of the Sichuan people and the state of Shu in general, the Three Kingdoms period saw the establishment of an independent Shu state by Liu Bei in 221. It was here that Shu was immortalized into history and it is here from which we today draw inspiration, unification, and lessons from."
 zhuge_liang: "Zhuge Liang"
 zhuge_liang_desc: "After the death of Liu Bei in 223, his heir, Liu Shan took to the throne at age 16 with Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents overseeing most of the administration. Zhuge Liang in particular took control of most matters and attempted to put the Shu state in a better position against the domineering Wei state via aggressive expeditions from 228 to 234. Though none of the expeditions resulted in major changes on the political or military stage, the endurance and cunning that Zhuge Liang displayed as well as dedication to the Shu state is something all of us admire and strive to emulate."
 defensive_position: "Defensive Position"
 defensive_position_desc: "The geography of the Sichuan Basin makes it ideal for defending. This was clearly evident during the Three Kingdoms period since attacks from Shu required more effort and resources as opposed to defensive encounters. We would do well to remember this fact and fortify our defenses where and when possible."
 connections_through_trade: "Trade Connections"
 connections_through_trade_desc: "A key fact of the Sichuan Basin and when the Shu state came to prominence in the early to mid-3rd century was the conenctions through trade. South and west of the Sichuan Basin lay divided land that is tough to subjugate, but lucrative in trading opportunities. We need not always conquer places that provide us with wealth and resources, for they will soon bow to the people of Shu in time. Benevolence is something that is to be strived for, not ruthlessness."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 WUU_ideas: "Wun Ideas"
 WUU_ideas_start: "Wun Traditions"
 WUU_ideas_bonus: "Wun Ambition"
 history_of_independence: "History of Independence"
 history_of_independence_desc: "The history of the region that is Wu and its independence stretches to before the 10th century BC. Military history as well as political and diplomatic history was forged both inside of and on the borders of the Wu region, leading to a fairly well defined sub-culture of China that still surges with power."
 waters_of_wu: "The Waters of Wu"
 waters_of_wu_desc: "The coastal waters are where much of the imports and exports of Wu go through. As such, it is only natural that we seek to protect these waters with a robust and large navy."
 three_kingdoms_period: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_desc: "The Three Kingdoms period was perhaps one of the most defining periods in the history of the Wu region since it marked it's last echo of independence until the 10th century AD. The military, cultural markers, and societal aspects of this time period are not lost on our people and we will continue to bask in the glory that was Eastern Wu."
 promote_coastal_trade: "Promote Coastal Trade"
 promote_coastal_trade_desc: "The ports of Wu grow in size and importance as time goes on. Some of the most important ports in China are found in our land, so why not capitalize on it and help grow our revenue sector via trade?"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period: "The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdom Period"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period_desc: "The state of Wuyue, founded in 907 by Qian Liu, was perhaps the most powerful of the southern states of this chaotic time period after the Tang Dynasty. During its independence until 978, many infrastructure projects were put into motion and the land of Wu was greatly developed, leading to even more value coming to the region."
 the_sun_dynasty: "The Sun Dynasty"
 the_sun_dynasty_desc: "True to our history, the Sun Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms Period held the dominant position despite succession struggles clouding the future of Wu. It is through the continuation of the Sun Dynasty that Wu will prosper and maintain itself as a grand and propserous region in China."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."
 CHC_ideas: "Chu Ideas"
 CHC_ideas_start: "Chu Traditions"
 CHC_ideas_bonus: "Chu Ambition"
 foundation_in_myths: "Foundations in Myths"
 foundation_in_myths_desc: "From the legends in Sima Qian's 'Records of the Grand Historian', the royal family of Chu was descended from the Yellow Emperor (also known as Huangdi) and his grandson/successor Zhuanxu. Though the tale of the royal family's birth is longer than this in its entirety, our connections to traditional Chinese myths and deities gives us prestige in the eyes of those in and outside our state."
 control_over_central_china: "Control over Central China"
 control_over_central_china_desc: "The fertile region of Central China holds plenty of potential for agriculture, and a large population by natural consequences. Chu's foundation in the region makes it ideal for expansion by fielding a large military from places that are easier to develop and manage. We must keep in line with this way of thinking and continue to build up urban centers throughout Chu so that we do not falter in our military or economic potential"
 the_spring_autumn_period: "The Spring and Autumn Period"
 the_spring_autumn_period_desc: "The decline in authority from the Eastern Zhou throughout the latter 700's BC was the rallying call for the Chu state and many others. As authority from the court in Luoyi declined (having already been in a downward spiral since the invasion of the Quanrong prior to 771BC), power in the hands of smaller states grew immensely to the point where the they would wage wars against each other for hegemony and pay little attention to the Eastern Zhou. It is here that Chu gained its strength and passion to fight for itself, both of which we have not lost."
 take_on_gov_corruption: "Take on Government Corruption"
 take_on_gov_corruption_desc: "One aspect of the government of Chu was how corrupt it was at times. Administrators in both the military and the government were often doing secret deals or taking bribes that none could stop. If we are to be successful in our administrative tasks and military organization, there needs to be a stricter stance on corruption and more severe punishments for those found responsible for corrupt ties."
 qin_chu_rivalry: "Qin-Chu Rivarly"
 qin_chu_rivalry_desc: "Our most ardent and deadly rival was the legalist state of Qin. Though we were larger than they were in both military size and territorial size, they were much more disciplined and administratively focused; our ancestors simply could not compete against them and fell in them in about 223BC. Now that we are resurgent, we would do well to reform our military and practice proper discipline within so that any rivals to our power won't win so easily. The legalism can come later."
 stop_internal_decadence: "Stop Internal Decadence"
 stop_internal_decadence_desc: "A main facet of our culture in the Spring and Autumn Period and in the subsequent Warring States Period was just how relaxed and laid-back our culture was, so much so that it began to affect society on a much larger scale. Sure, our arts and crafts were truly unique and our culture was flourishing, but this relaxed nature will lead to inefficient societies that lead further into decadance, something that most assuredly happened to our ancestors. There can be art and pleasure in our culture, but Chu must remain an efficient and robust state at all levels."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 battle_of_toulouse_721: "Battle of Toulouse, 721AD"
 battle_of_toulouse_721_desc: "When the Umayyad Caliphate was seeking to invade north into Frankish territory, it was Odo of Aquiitaine who righteously defended the land of Toulouse at this pivotal battle in 721AD. We must remember this historic moment in our history and keep it close to us as we move on throughout time."
 treaty_of_paris_1229: "Treaty of Paris, 1229AD"
 treaty_of_paris_1229_desc: "This treaty was the one in which our region, Occitania, lost its political autonomy and was annexed into the French domain. This wasn't a violent annexation, however, but a sign of our way of marrying into other nations and gaining influence from the inside. Granted, this treaty cost us dearly, we will make sure in the future that marriages and dynastic unions go firmly our way."
 revenge_for_albigensian_crusade: "Revenge for our Ancestors"
 revenge_for_albigensian_crusade_desc: "The Albigensian Crusade some time ago was a great loss for our people. The wretched Catholics from the north and the Pope himself calling for the execution of the Cathar faith as a whole led to our downfall and it has been hard to recover ever since. It is time we take matters into our own hands and make sure others know that the Albigensian Crusade has not been forgotten."
 the_cathar_faith: "The Cathar Faith"
 the_cathar_faith_desc: "Catharism was rife in Toulouse and Languedoc in the 12th to 14th century, but the Albigensian Crusade put a harsh and bloody blade to the throat of it. Now that Catharism is resurging, we must promote it and take solace in its teachings."
 troubadours_and_occitain_culture: "Occitain Culture"
 troubadours_and_occitain_culture_desc: "A key facet of our culture? Troubadours and and the Occitan language. With both in use as well as the French and Catalan languages mixed in as well, the great culture of Occitania can be the envy of the world and make our nation into a true spectacle on the world stage."
 distinct_identity_from_the_north: "Distinct Identity"
 distinct_identity_from_the_north_desc: "We must remember how different we are from the French people to the north. A distinct language, culture, faith, we are separate from them in so many key ways and we should be proud of it. Our righteous leader will be the prime promoter of our identity no matter what happens to us."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region. There must be a unifying force between the French people, a single polity that can seize the mantle of power and signify true dominance over the region, and we will see to it that we do our best to ensure that it is us."

 successor_to_the_visigoths: "Successor to the Visigoths"
 successor_to_the_visigoths_desc: "In the 7th to 8th centuries, Aquitaine was subjected to the likes of Roman and Visigothic laws that meshed together to create a sort of hybrid system of administration that did us well. Looking back on this combination of laws and not only reforming it, but codifying it as well, could do the entire nation good."
 carolingian_legacy: "Carolingian Legacy"
 carolingian_legacy_desc: "The complex system of dynasties and counts and fiefdoms inside the Frankish realm was undoubtedly tough to navigate, but the nobles of Aquitaine managed to make prominent strides within it after Pepin I, one of the sons of Charlemagne, and were granted the lands of Aquitaine in 814AD. It is now part of our duty to defend this land with all that we've got, keeping the legacy of our ancestors safe and ensuring our own safety in the process."
 eleanor_of_aquitaine: "Eleanor of Aquitaine"
 eleanor_of_aquitaine_desc: "Perhaps our best known figure, Eleanor of the house of of Poiters and the inheritor of Aquitaine after her father's death navigated the political heights of England and France in the 12th century and kept Aquitaine in good care by her diplomatic and marrital actions. Even though her death lent our land to England's King Henry II, the memory of her and her actions live on."
 hundred_years_war_memories: "Memories of the 100 Years War"
 hundred_years_war_memories_desc: "The terror and horror of the 100 Years War has taught the Aquitanian people many things, one of the foremost being that, we simply cannot and will not neglect our military."
 english_and_french_influences: "English and French Influences"
 english_and_french_influences_desc: "England and France have both tried their hands at taking over Aquitaine and securing it firmly, but such a thing is undoubtedly hard to do. Since we have experiences with both, however, we can take this time to reflect and learn from both sides. Though both England and France may have different styles of administrating land, dealing with inheritance, and levying taxes and what-not, we can still learn and take advantage of them, can't we?"
 fertility_of_aquitaine: "Fertility of Aquitaine"
 fertility_of_aquitaine_desc: "Our lands are quite rich in agricultural potential and we've capitalized on this in the past. By continuing to do so, we can cultivate a growing population and in turn, a large reserve of soldiers for our own defense, or our own invasions."

 maintain_the_house_of_este_desc: "The House of Este has been with the Duchy of Ferrara since its inception and it's done us well in keeping the people loyal, safe, and productive. We must not let the House of Este fall out of favor, even if they aren't ruling as the formal leaders of Ferrara, since they have built up the duchy to such a height already."
 italian_tensions: "Italian Tensions"
 italian_tensions_desc: "Italy is rife with tension between feuding families and duchies and republics. The time for mercenary regiments is upon us and administrators as well as military personnel know this full well. We must take advantage of this fact and utilize them when needed so that we can sustain our military potential in this time of extreme tension."
 rival_of_venice: "Rivals of Venice"
 rival_of_venice_desc: "The Venetians are a troublesome bunch, meddling in our affairs and seeking to control all the trade in and around the Adriatic. They aim to destroy the Duchy of Ferrara, whether they say so or not, and we must be ready to stand against these efforts at all points. The people of Ferrara will not live under the flag of Venice, nor any other flag that does not come from the House of Este!"

 promote_high_european_culture_desc: "Ferrara is seen as one of the centers of high culture in Europe as great minds, musicians, architects, and writers are coming through our land and our capital to promote their works. By keeping this trend going and being a true patron of these various crafts, we can become more well-known and prestigious than any other state around."
 cultivate_the_duchy_of_ferrara: "Cultivate Ferrara"
 cultivate_the_duchy_of_ferrara_desc: "Ferrara itself is growing at a fair rate with its people flourishing and the cities expanding steadily. As such, there will be a need enforce laws and regulations more strictly throughout, lest we wish for decadance to take hold of the entirety of the land."
 build_up_the_court_of_ferrara: "Build up our Court"
 build_up_the_court_of_ferrara_desc: "The court of Ferrara itself is rather small in size compared to those of other places in Italy and Europe as a whole. In order to to compare to those larger courts, we will need to expand the range of minds we employ as adivsors and courtiers as well as reform how the court works in general, that way we can streamline matters and expand it over time."
 from_the_hre_to_italy: "From North to South"
 from_the_hre_to_italy_desc: "All around Ferrara there are opportunities for friends and enemies. To the north, the Holy Roman Empire; the south, more Italian land and then the Mediterranean itself, harboring island nations and then the Maghreb. Each path gives us an interesting choice and set of options, but we must be flexible in our negotiations and deals. Ferrara can't survive alone, and enough good friends can go a long way toward making the people of Ferrara loyal and prosperous."

 hre_border_state: "Border State"
 hre_border_state_desc: "Originally, the Archbishopric of Magdeburg was established near the frontier of the Holy Roman Empire. At the time of the 10th century, it was a much more fearsome place with more threats from tribal people, but now it is what we simply call home. Though, through our legacy as a border state, we've learned to take in and spread knowledge around more so than other states since that was part of our early duties (though, back then, it was more Catholic knowledge than anything else)."
 legacy_of_promoting_christianity: "Legacy of Promoting Christianity"
 legacy_of_promoting_christianity_desc: "Ever since we started out, we've been staunch promoters of Christianity to those who were distinctly not Christian. As such, we've learned various ways to help promote our faith via incentives, debates, coercion, and other matters. Some methods may not be pretty, others may go on without any issue, but we will get the job done."
 settle_internal_matters: "Settle Internal Matters"
 settle_internal_matters_desc: "The various conflicts between secular and religious authorities in our land is nothing new.

 consolidate_the_districts: "Consolidate the Districts"
 consolidate_the_districts_desc: "Communities throuhgout Madgeburg are varying in their origin and background, but they all contribute to the administration as a whole.

 legacy_of_the_great_saxon_revolt_desc: "When the Saxon people revolted in the 12th century, we sided with the Holy Roman Emperor and as such, helped suppress the revolt altogether. We were justly rewarded for our assistance and we gained prominence in the Holy Roman Empire because of it, thus attracting more great minds to our land than before. Today, we continue this tradition rightly and our court is ever the more grand because of it."
 defensive_stance: "Defensive Stance"
 defensive_stance_desc: "Taking the offensive stance is something Magdeburg has rarely ever done. We have been much more focused on internal affairs for quite some time and with such things being sorted, we can focus on ensuring that our defenses are primed and ready. Any invader who comes at the people of Magdeburg will leave in a much worse state than when they came."
 break_away_state_protestant_reformed: "Choosing a Path"
 break_away_state_protestant_reformed_desc: "The Catholic Church is rife with contention and the Protestant Reformation is forcing everyone to choose sides and denominations.

 former_hindu_center_desc: "The memories of our land being a center of Hinduism is not lost upon us. The beliefs spread by people from centuries still affect us to this day and the shrines and writings from back then remind us of how we must tolerate those of different faiths within our lands. Without a tolerant outlook towards these people, Kedah would be stuck in a constant cycle of strife and destruction."

 influences_from_srivijaya_desc: "The once mighty empire of Srivijaya stretched its influence far into the north and south, reaching even our lands in Kedah.

 chola_empire_influences: "Influences from the Chola Empire"
 chola_empire_influences_desc: "The ships and merchants from the Chola Empire taught the Malay people a great many things about trade routes and mercantile ways, much of which still remain with our people. By utilizing what they've taught our people from so long ago and building upon it, Kedah will be able to garner more power from simply trade routes and trade sectors alone."
 quality_army_of_kedah: "High Quality Army"
 quality_army_of_kedah_desc: "The military of Kedah is something that shouldn't be overlooked. For too long we have relied on tactics and strategies from foreign states where they swear allegiance to foreign lords. Kedah must come up with its own unique tactics and strategies so that its troops will be of the highest quality compared to neighboring states, and states from far away."
 confluence_of_giants: "At the Confluence of Giants"
 confluence_of_giants_desc: "From the north, the Thai kingdoms reign supreme, one after another. From the south, kingdoms and smaller states rock the jungles and waters alike to show dominance. Kedah is at the crossroads of both regions and as a result, hears and witnesses some of these great nations do battle. Kedah and its people must watch and learn carefully as they clash, so that the military of Kedah can build up its own measures against what is currently employed in battle."
 promote_kedah_merchants: "Promote Kedah Merchants"
 promote_kedah_merchants_desc: "As the prominence of Kedah increases, so to do our merchants. In a bid to increase our trade dominance, promoting our own merchants seems like an obvious measure we should take, and one we will actively pursue in the coming time periods. If we don't capitalize on the valuable trade opportunities, our rivals surely will, and we simply must not let that happen."
 protect_the_coasts: "Protect the Coasts"
 protect_the_coasts_desc: "The coastline of Kedah grows ever larger the more we conquer. Thus, the coastal settlements of Kedah deserve protection from foreign ships and amphibious invasions, necessitating the building of a grand fleet of ships capable of driving off any would-be invasion force. Our military will be capable of holding the fortifications and communities down, it is the waters around our land that we must worry about now."

 legacy_of_the_investiture_controversy_desc: "The controversy that led to Pinamonte Bonacolsi taking power in 1273 as Captain General of the People was named the Investiture Controversy and we should count ourselves thankful for it. Mantua, under Pinamonte and his family, grew to be quite prosperous and grand to all states around at the time. It wasn't until 1328 that the last Bonacolsi was ousted from power by the House of Gonzaga, but the legacy left by the Investiture Controversy will never be forgotten by us."

 backroom_deals: "Backroom Deals"
 backroom_deals_desc: "Bribery, coercion, threats, they all fall under the category of 'making deals happen'... They just, take a different approach to making such deals go through. Mantua is no stranger to dealing in these matters and must continue to do so so that it can continue to come out on top of diplomatic endeavors."
 episcopal_influences: "Episcopal Influences"
 episcopal_influences_desc: "Being situated in the Italian Peninsula gives us opportunities for a myriad of things, one of which is episcopal influence from the Papacy itself. Though we don't wish to fall under direct authority from the Papal States themselves, more religious authority in the lands of Mantua is most always nice to have."
 the_gonzagas: "The Gonzagas"
 the_gonzagas_desc: "Whether or not the Gonzagas have been good for Mantua is up for debate, but it is safe to say that they've been a stabilizing influence in communities around the land itself. It would be best for us not to stifle them out of Mantua entirely since they do call our land home, at least in part."
 mercenary_connections: "Mercenary Connections"
 mercenary_connections_desc: "The vast underground network of mercenary camps and regiments is rife with contracts ready to be taken up and ready to be offered out. Since we are no stranger to using hired soldiers, our reputation with many mercenary groups is better than other nations around us, granting us better rates overall."
 protect_mantua: "Protect Mantua"
 protect_mantua_desc: "It is not a want, but a need. The people of Mantua must be protected from the authorities outside its borders.

 remember_the_sarir_dynasty_desc: "One of the first positions of power our people came into was called Sarir. Lasting from about the 5th century to the 12th century, it saw great developments for the Avar people and the cementing of the Avar people in the Caucuses. To this day, we still do claim to be descended from  the Sarir state, although in a different form, giving us legitimacy in the eyes of the Avarian people."
 wars_of_the_caucuses: "Wars of the Caucuses"
 wars_of_the_caucuses_desc: "The hills and mountains by which we call home are by no means easy to live in, let alone wage war in. Yet, time and time again, the Avar people have routinely fought in these harsh conditions, seeking to maintain their own identity and their own state. It is through these conflicts that we've learned to fend off attrition better, aiding us in prolonged conflicts that see the Avarian people and troops being pushed to the edge."
 alliance_shifts: "Alliance Shifts"
 alliance_shifts_desc: "We've seen several states rise and fall throughout our history in the Caucuses. In order to secure our own safety, we've had to ally various powers from the north, the south, the east, and the west, causing us to have to engage in alliances and diplomacy on all sides. As this is still the case, we must be ready to do this all over again and safeguard our independence by diplomatic means."
 revenge_against_gazikumukh: "Revenge Against Gazikumukh"
 revenge_against_gazikumukh_desc: "The Gazikumukh Samkhalate have claimed to be the rulers of the Avar people and the lands that Avar hold for some time now. Though we vehemently detest this and have tried to fight them off, we failed in the past and were forced into subjugation. One day, though, we can and will have our revenge against the tyrannical power that is Gazikumukh, and the Avar will breathe the air of their ancestors: the air of independence."
 stave_off_the_external_threats: "External Threats"
 stave_off_the_external_threats_desc: "The threats outside of the Caucuses are great and numerous; almost every culture in the region knows it as they've seen numerous invaders come by over the centuries. If the Avar people are to be different, if they are to be ready for these invasions when they come around, adopting improved military technology and bolstering our military potential should be a top priority."
 lessons_of_the_caucuses: "Lessons of the Caucuses"
 lessons_of_the_caucuses_desc: "Such is the terrain that we call home, mountains and hills on the northern side of the Caucuses, that invaders often find little room for supply trains on top of sturdy defensive positions that are well built and well stocked. This will continue to be the case and how we set up defenses in our homeland will be a model for how we set up defensive positions elsewhere."
 cultures_of_the_caucuses: "Cultures of the Caucuses"
 cultures_of_the_caucuses_desc: "There are several distinct languages, cultures, traditions, and customs here in the Caucuses. From the Alans to the Circassians to the Georgians and many others, we know that they all desire to be left autonomous in some way and accepted for who they are. Being as one from this group of distinct cultures situated in the vast mountains, we can empathize and sympathize with these various groups and come to accept them into our own domain, even though the same was not always done to our people in the past."

 rival_of_central_italy_desc: "The various powers of Italy are all attempting to cut each other down in some way, shape, or form in order to gain the upper hand and we've seen this go on for upwards of centuries now.

 republic_in_sea_of_monarchies: "The Few Republics"
 republic_in_sea_of_monarchies_desc: "There are few in Italy, and indeed all of Europe, that think like the Luccans do.

 receeding_hre_influences: "Receeding Holy Roman Empire Influences"
 receeding_hre_influences_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire tried to maintain control over Italy and the minor states within it, but we've been feeling the waning authority of its emperors for some time now. Luccan people no longer should pay fealty to such a far-away lord of different culture, different tongue, and different governing structure; and now that other states are free from the grip of that terrible political project, land will be easier to acquire from our enemies."
 take_on_republican_reforms: "Take on Republican Reforms"
 take_on_republican_reforms_desc: "As time goes on and our ideals slowly evolve due to the coming about of new technologies and ideas, the government of Lucca must be ready to reform itself in various ways when the need arises.

 merovingian_legacy: "Merovingian Legacy"
 merovingian_legacy_desc: "The Merovingian dynasty took special interest in Frankfurt as a city. The mighty Charlemagne himself built a royal court here and performed certain ceremonies and held important meetings during his reign at Frankfurt itself. The prominence of Frankfurt woulud continue on throughout the Merovingian lineage of successors and with their influence in Frankfurt's ancestry, none will be surprised when we come to reclaim what is rightfully belonging to us."

 policing_the_streets_desc: "We empoly a variety of guardians and military protectors within the main city of frankfurt in order to keep order and stability within it.

 an_army_for_frankfurt_desc: "To defend out city, its prestige, its legitimacy, its grandeur and prominence all at once, we will need a true military force to assert some sort of power internally and externally. A more unified populace will be the first stepping stone to making this happen."

 encourage_scientific_intrigue_desc: "Due to the significance of Frankfurt as a place of trade and commercial interests, great minds (artists, investors, thinkers, writers, etc.) are coming through our town and sharing their valuable knowledge with a myriad of locals.

Though we may not have been able to stop the Christinization of our people, we certainly have been able to stop (or at least slow) the influence of the Livonian Order upon the Livonian people. It is our duty now to take revenge upon the foul crusader order and drive them into the annals of history."

 livonian_population_resurgence_desc: "The original people of the Baltic region are slowly retaking the land they once lost. Those from the old tribes are coming back in larger numbers as the generations go by, and our communities are becoming more expansive as time goes on.

 curionian_semigallian_latgallian_fighters_desc: "The fall of the several Baltic tribes to the crusders was not without bloodshed on both sides. The Curonians, Semigallians, Latgalians, and Selonians all resisted the incoming armored knights baring crosses, and this fighting spirit within them is not lost, even to this very day. By recruiting these people into our ranks, the Livonian military will be a true threat to those around us."

The bastions they built up along with the conflicts they fought in the Levant and on Syrian land are remembered well by our people, but our people would be fools to only tell the tales of the crusades and not learn from them. Using what they left behind and engineering tight and sound defensive structures like they did will allow us to withstand invasion after invasion."

If we are able to direct more trade into our land and profit off of it then we will undoubtedly be able to monopolize the trade in time and eventually make Mentese a commercial hub unlike any other. Still, this will take time to do and we must be careful with how we approach this matter."

 eastern_beylik: "Eastern Beylik"
 eastern_beylik_desc: "Our land is the easternmost of the old beyliks that were around after the collapse of the Sultanate of Rum, allowing contact with powers outside of Anatolia itself. Our contacts with the Turkomans, Georgians, as well as other groups of people have allowed us to formalize effective mercenary deals over time and with them in our arsenal, we can ensure a steady supply hired guns that can replace our own men in battle."
 uyghur_mongol_foundations: "Uyghur and Mongol Foundation"
 uyghur_mongol_foundations_desc: "Our founder, Eretna, was originally a Mongol officer and traced his lineage back to the Uyghurs themselves.

 eastern_and_western_fighting: "Eastern and Western Fighting"
 eastern_and_western_fighting_desc: "There are other beyliks to our west and hostile powers to our east that all seek to cut down the Eretnids and force them into submission, but we must not let this happen at any cost! We will fight our enemies on all fronts and defend our land from invasions on all sides! The Eretnids will survive and they will not be defeated so easily!"
 resolve_eretnid_disputes: "Resolve Eretnid Disputes"
 resolve_eretnid_disputes_desc: "If there was key factor that led to our downfall earlier in our history, it was internal dynastic conflicts. An issue of great importance to Eretna as a whole, sorting this matter out sooner rather than later will help ensure internal peace and prevent us from collapsing in on ourselves."
 protective_ties: "Protective Ties"
 protective_ties_desc: "We must not be strong in only our military, but also strong in our diplomacy. The more nations we can keep in regular contact with who would help us rather than hurt us, the better off Eretna as whole will be, and the more power we will be able to exert upon others around us."
 emulate_our_founder: "Emulate our Founder"
 emulate_our_founder_desc: "Our founder was seen in his day as a scholar and one to be looked up to. As a prominent figure in Eretna, he is looked up to by many and his scholarly endeavors are well accounted for by the Eretnids.

 after_the_decline_of_rum_desc: "After the Sultanate of Rum went into decline, we were one of the beyliks to prove ourselves capable of securing positions of power and territories of importance. We must never forget how we came about and we must strive to maintain Germiyanid power throughout the ages."

 rivals_of_karaman_desc: "The Karamanids were one our most prominent rivals. Though we may have been bested by them in a few ways during our more powerful years, we are still willing to learn from these mistakes of ours, and from them, we will build a more refined structure the Germiyanids."
 ilkhanid_influences: "Ilkhanid Influences"
 ilkhanid_influences_desc: "The Ilkhanate held great influence in Anatolia for a short time, but with that influence came with it the influence of more cavalry-oriented military tactics.

 subjugate_the_coastal_beyliks_desc: "The coast=s are where we faltered when we first came about. Our once loyal military leaders who led expeditions to the coasts revolted against our authority and successfully broke away, leading to our decline. The times have changed, however, and we will work to see these coastal areas returned to the rightful authority that they belong to: The Germiyanids."
 rein_in_unruly_commanders: "Rein in Unruly Commands"
 rein_in_unruly_commanders_desc: "The command structure of our military is something that lacks real cohesion and merit and its evident when commanders become too powerful and seek to actively disobey our orders. This will be no more in the future and we will enforce a new system, rigid and meritocratic and working to keep military options for Germiyan open and viable."
 western_beylik: "Western Beylik"
 western_beylik_desc: "Since we are situated closer to the western edge of Anatolia, we are more foten in touch with scholars and cultured minds of Europe who bring with them interesting ideas that we have yet to come across. It would do Germiyan well to have these minds be welcome into our land rather than turned away altogether."

 beyond_anatolia_desc: "Us, of Dulkadir, are on the edge of Anatolia. To the east lies uncertain potential and danger, but perhaps it holds more opportunity than harm for us if we can navigate the political and diplomatic swamp that swirls around us. It will not be easy, but it is most certainly worth a try."
 buffer_state: "Buffer State"
 buffer_state_desc: "Dulkadir is seen merely as a buffer state in the midst of the 15th century, but there is potential in us hidden deep within. In order to draw that potential out, however, we will need time and resources and in that time, there will be those who want to put a sword to our throat, slashing with mercy. It is our duty to defend what is rightfully Dulkadiri in nature until the time is right to lash out in rigthteous conquest."

 promote_the_dynasty_desc: "The dynasty of Dulkadir is one that knows how to spread into other courts. We have connections to other nations around us through marriages and other means, many of which stem from our royal family. If we keep this going and maintain the foundation of the dynasty within Dulkadiri lands, we'll be better set externally as well as internally."

 oghuz_connections_desc: "Our ancestors were (and sometimes still are) called the 'Oghuz Turks'. Though seemingly scattered and separated, there are several bands of them still roaming about, serving as mercenaries throughout the lands around us. If we can cooperate with them and perhaps formalize contracts with them, Dulkadir can ensure itself a steady stream of mercenaries for future wars."
 mamluk_ties: "Mamluk Ties"
 mamluk_ties_desc: "The Mamluk Sultanate to our south is something of a worry in more ways than one, but we hold connections to them since many of the trade routes that go to them pass through our land directly. Cultivating this connection over time, even if the Mamluk Sultanate dies out, will result in not only great external assurance, but also internal benefits as well."
 extending_our_influence: "Extending our Influence"
 extending_our_influence_desc: "As the years go by, Dulkadir finds itself growing more and more aware of how far its influence goes in the world around it.

 tensions_with_mamluk_sultanate_desc: "The Levant and Egypt itself are in the control of the Mamluk Sultanate. Though there are times where we cooperate with them, there is undoubtedly a sense of tension between us and them. We must be on watch and be ready to take action whenever they are weak, or whenever they feel as though attacking us is a good idea."
 adana_buffer: "Adana Buffer"
 adana_buffer_desc: "Our lands are not only a crossing point between the regions of Anatolia and the Levant, but it is also inherently valuable as a defensive position to plot and launch an invasion from as well as a place to help control the trade routes of the Eastern Mediterranean. It would do us good if utilized Adana to its full extent and began recruiting men for a larger and more formal army that only the Ramazani people could train and maintain."

 settle_the_land_desc: "The land of Adana remains largely untapped in its potential for agriculture and other resources.

 raids_at_sea_desc: "The rulers of the Aydin Beylik were infamous for their raids along the coasts and islands of the Aegean Sea. Who are we to stop doing what our ancestors did in the past? It's a profitable and a worthy endeavor, espeically when the ones we are raiding are simply undeserving of prosperity and wealth, unlike us."
 naval_power_from_smyrna: "Naval Power from Smyrna"
 naval_power_from_smyrna_desc: "Smyrna is where our naval power spread out from. Though it wasn't always in our hands, when it was, we made extensive use of it and made sure that all those within range of the city could feel our presence. Let us once again do as such and take on those who would try to take down the Aydinids."

 revenge_for_the_smyrniote_crusades_desc: "Two times did Pope Clement VI call for a crusade against our former leader, Umur Beg, for getting involved in the Byzantine Civil War of 1343-1351. Though the result was less than favorable for us, the Aydinids stayed strong and resisted the crusades to the very end in 1402. This example still inspires our people to this day, giving us hope to take revenge for what was done to us."
 securing_aegean_trade: "Securing Aegean Trade"
 securing_aegean_trade_desc: "The trade routes flowing through the Aegean Sea call to us, just asking to be raided, but they also call to us to be controlled for the interests of the Aydinids in general. Perhaps we can siphon income from the sea for ourselves and maybe elsewhere and pirate the rest that doesn't belong to us?"
 changes_from_tamerlane: "Changes from Tamerlane"
 changes_from_tamerlane_desc: "When Tamerlane came through and fundamentally changed the political landscape of Anatolia, we too were changed in many ways. It would do us good to learn from the invasion of Tamerlane and to innovate on what he did so that we too may be able to crush those who oppose us in the region."
 establish_aydinid_architecture: "Aydinid Architecture"
 establish_aydinid_architecture_desc: "The monuments we left behind from our founding are still around to this day, scattered around and slowly decaying without proper maintenance.

 sarukhan_bey_desc: "Our founder, Sarukhan Bey, long lived in his time, was the one who broke away from the Germiyanids and gave us actual power. Breaking away at the Gediz River and seizing considerable power for himself, the Saruhan Beylik would come to be quite powerful under his authority and we must strive to emulate this."
 emirate_of_germiyan: "Emirate of Germiyan"
 emirate_of_germiyan_desc: "Due to our ties to the Germiyanids, our court is occupied by scholars and courtiers of similar cultures. Even when we expand and incorporate different people into our court, we will be sure to privilege those of our tongue and customs over those unlike us so that we can have a more unified and less complex system of adivsors and scholars."

 great_mosque_at_manisa_desc: "At Manisa lies a grand mosque built by our people. It's grandeur inspires faithful people from all over our land to come and worship at it whilst helping increase our piety as compared to other nations around us. Let this great mosque stand as a monument to all Saruhanid people and empower them ever further in their faith without failure."
 promote_naval_power: "Promote Naval Supremacy"
 promote_naval_power_desc: "The coastal areas in which we call our own are key to housing a fleet and ensuring that our part of the Aegean Sea is safely under our control. If we can make good on our naval supremacy from the past, nothing will stand in our way of obtaining hegemony over the waters."

 rival_of_the_byzantines_desc: "We have had several contentions with teh Byzantines in the past and we remember them well. Skirmishes on land and at sea has led us to rethink and reform how we perform military tactics and strategy, giving us crucial insight into how we should be in the future."
 gunpowder_innovations: "Gunpowder Innovations"
 gunpowder_innovations_desc: "As time goes on, the Saruhanids are becoming more and more familiar with gunpowder weapons and their potential. By investing time and energy into refining them and perfecting them, perhaps nothing will stand in the way of the Saruhanids from obtaining absolute control of Anatolia and beyond.

 zoroastrian_legacy_desc: "The pious nature of the Yazdi people has been known since the time of the Sassanids. Though faiths change over time, the effort our people put into making their faith as true and as great as can be can be seen when Zoroastrianism was still dominant in Persia. Using these old traditions, we will ensure that our faith today shines as brightly as it did before."
 difficulties_of_yazd: "The Difficulties of Yazd"
 difficulties_of_yazd_desc: "Yazd is not only a difficult place to live, but it is also a difficult place to fight inside of. The isolated parts of it harbor safe passage and resources, but other those parts, people are subject to the elements around them. It is through these difficulties that we have learned to hone our shock-based desert tactics, and when we need to fight oustide of Yazd, we will be sure to adapt these tactics to the different envrironments."

 capital_of_the_muzaffarid_dynasty_desc: "The Muzaffarid Dynasty may have had but a brief life in Persia, but they had their capital at one point stationed in Yazd itself. Though we can only speculate as to why they did so, one likely reason is due to the defensive nature of Yazd itself. Compounding upon this defensive mentality in our other lands will help us withstand future invasion from foreign rivals."
 haven_in_persia: "Haven in Persia"
 haven_in_persia_desc: "For a long time now, we've been known as a safe haven for Persians everywhere who are fleeing persecution or are in need of respite. Yazd may be unforgiving to the invader seeking harm, but it is welcoming to those that see it as a fellow family member of the Persian region. With this in mind, expanding outwards will be less of any issue if we continue this policy of being a safe haven for Persian people."
 silk_weaving_industry: "Silk Weaving Industry"
 silk_weaving_industry_desc: "A commodity and wondrous material, silk, is readily produced in Yazd and its patterns and production are unique to Yazd itself (or so some say). We'd prefer to keep this silk production going as strong as possible, but to also not overwhelm our people with it, so we will need to balance out how production of it will scale in the future."
 sassanian_roots: "Sassanian Roots"
 sassanian_roots_desc: "Yazd itself is named after the Shahanshah of the Sassanid Empire, Yazdegerd I. Throughout the times from the Sassanid Empire onwards, Yazd has been known as a sort of memorial or legacy place that the Sassanids left behind in their wake, and with that legitimacy backing us, we can be sure that people from around Persia will support our authority."

 uniting_persia_desc: "The pieces of Persia lay scattered and divided, fighting for dominance after the fall of Timur and in the face of threats from the north, west, and the east. However hard of a goal it might be to reach, the ambition to unite Persia once more under a single dynasty that is stable and righteous is what Yazd is set out to do.

 house_of_nassau: "The House of Nassau"
 house_of_nassau_desc: "With the House of Nassau being of the utmost prominence within our land, we must ensure that succession and legitimacy are not an issue to worry about.

 remember_count_adolf_of_nassau_desc: "Count Adolf of Nassau was elected Holy Roman Emperor from 1292 to 1298 and although he was weak in his authority due to the nature of the Holy Roman Empire and the electors wanting a weak emperor in the first place, his election brought about the land of Nassau onto the forefront of politics at the time. If we are to do this once more and bring Nassau to the forefront of matters throughout Central Europe, diplomacy must not be overlooked and being open and ready to whatever diplomatic intrigue that grants favor our way must be welcome by Nassau."
 dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 dynastic_politics_desc: "The nature of dynasties being intertwined with politics is nothing new to us, and if we utilize our connections throughout Europe correctly, we can enssure that our dynastic politics help cushion any blow dealt to us in the future."
 reformation_fervor_in_nassau: "Reformation Fervor in Nassau"
 reformation_fervor_in_nassau_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has broken Europe up into several fragments with religion dividing them, alongside politics itself. Nassau itself must be ready to use this fervor to its advantage when it comes to defending itself via military force, and who knows, perhaps we can snag ourselves some cheaper mercenaries along the way due to the chaos and destruction occuring."
 dynastic_branches: "Dynastic Branching Paths"
 dynastic_branches_desc: "As our dynasty spreads into other realms and courts, it will undoubtedly start to become fragmented at points, taking on slightly different characteristics as time goes on. We will remind them readily, however, that they come from Nassau and that their ancestral land still has legitimacy over them."

 struggling_for_steppe_control_desc: "Wresting control of the steppe is never an easy task, not since the great Mongol Empire fell some time ago. Though we are not the best candidate to take hold of the chaotic region that we call home, we can refine ourselves and prove our worth in this effort."
 fall_of_the_golden_horde: "Fall of the Golden Horde"
 fall_of_the_golden_horde_desc: "With the fall of the Golden Horde to the west, power in Central Asia is scattered and people are looking for strong leadership wherever it presents itself. The Kazakh people and its leaders are just such a source, and if cultivate our power just right, the people of Central Asia and maybe even beyond will dutifully obey us."

 rivals_to_our_east_desc: "The east was home to the Chagatai and the Great Yuan, but now there merely hollow remnants in their place. Still, these remnants hold vestiges of power from their predecessors and are still our rivals, meaning we must take proper action against them and bring their banners under our own, uniting their people with the Kazakh people."
 cultures_of_the_steppe: "Cultures of the Steppe"
 cultures_of_the_steppe_desc: "The vast realm that is the steppe is home to a myriad of different languages and cultures, many of which see each other as rivals and enemies.

 expanding_our_internal_domain_desc: "Within the lands of the Kazakh, there are those who obey the leaders with little question, and those who hear very little from the leaders at all.

 modernize_our_tactics: "Modernize our Tactics"
 modernize_our_tactics_desc: "Time and time again, we are seeing the tactics of old run into issues against the modern weapons used predominantly by Europeans and those they trade with. Perhaps investing time and effort into modernization efforts for our military could yield positive results; our old tactics may be kept in books and documents for future use, but if the Kazakh military is to keep itself afloat, there must be some effort to reform and the military itself."

 utilize_corsairs_desc: "The tradition of pirating and using corsairs for shady interests is well known throughout Algiers and our navy is especially adept at it. If we invest in improvements into training and the materials and weapons used by our corsairs, maybe we can see a boost in profits? Or maybe we can see more ships come into our fold when they engage in battles on the high seas; enemy ships are always useful, whether its for scrap material or for use in our own fleet."
 import_gunpowder_weaponry: "Import Gunpowder Weaponry"
 import_gunpowder_weaponry_desc: "We are often used to the traditional methods of doing warfare in North Africa: blades, spears, bows-and-arrows, crossbows, and armor of some kind. This, however, is slowly becoming outdated as more and more we are seeing 'firearms' show up on the field of battle and being used by both infantry and cavalry. Algiers is nothing if not adaptable and will take to integrating these new weapons into the military so that they are not chained to the combat tactics of old."

 desert_tactics_desc: "The unforgiving terrain of North Africa is where Algerian people call home, and with its natural harshness comes a rather inexpensive defensive measure.

 champion_naval_combat_desc: "Trial by combat at sea is what Algerian sailors must endure, and each of our sailors that has passed the trial has proven to be a true champion out on the water.

 algiers_city_of_refuge_desc: "Algiers doesn't practice a very staunch version of Islam, normally,a nd the city of Algiers itself, a blossoming flower in the harshness of North Africa, is by no means a place of persecution for those seeking safety from other places.

Though the time has long passed since Islam was introduced and accepted into our societies, there are still tensions abound with Islam's various interpretations and teachings. It would serve us well if we were to mediate these differences peacefully and in a righteous manner, rather than hastily choosing one side and promoting violence against another side."

 endless_mercenary_ties_desc: "Vast is the pool of mercenaries that the Berber people can employ.

Strong Berber dynasties dotted the landscape of both North Africa and the overall timeline of Islamic North Africa for centuries and that has not changed in the slightest; we merely see some rise, and some fall, and the cycle continues on without end, seemingly. Let us take our place in the light and show the others around us that we too are part of these grand dynasties of our people!"
 make_amends_with_our_family_in_faith: "Making Amends with our Family in Faith"
 make_amends_with_our_family_in_faith_desc: "Though we may be mostly united in faith, there are parts of our society that are undoubtedly in a state of 'heresy' to a degree and they are resistant to any form of conversion. The solution for them is to not kill them outright and to cause widespread unrest for unjust murders, but, rather to attempt to cooperate with them and see to it that they are understood and reconciled with. Social cohesion is something Berber states need as times change, and a Berber family united in faith, to some degree, is better than a Berber family fighting itself over such matters."
 uniting_the_maghreb: "Uniting the Maghreb"
 uniting_the_maghreb_desc: "What is the goal of all Berbers who rule a state in North Africa? To see a unified power that can tame and unite the divided region into one single nation. True to the past it isn't easy to try for, but the Maghreb must know peace one day, under one flag that comes from the people native to it."

 ancient_memories: "Ancient Memories"
 ancient_memories_desc: "We have a long tradition in the region of France, with settlements in our area dating back to the times of the Gallic tribes. Deriving our name from the 'Arverni' tribe that fiercly resisted the Romans under the leader Vercingetorix, Aurvergne today still remembers much of its history and keeps it close, whether it is in the field of battle or in the streets of every day society."
 developments_of_auvergne: "Developments in Auvergne"
 developments_of_auvergne_desc: "The 10th through 13th century were some of the best times for the Auvergnese people. Churches and abbeys and other structures were done during this time period, leading to a fairly propserous and autonomous area that was loved by its own people. It is high time we continue these developments and introduce new and updated infrastructure so that Auvergne may rise in stature once more."
 safe_from_conflicts: "Safe from Conflicts"
 safe_from_conflicts_desc: "Thanks to our positio in the region, we have been relatively safe from conflicts such as the Hundred Years' War and various plauges from around Europe. Such safety is valued by both peasants and nobles alike, leading to increased social cohesion and in the end, higher profit margins in the area of producing resources."
 take_back_our_autonomy: "Take back our Autonomy"
 take_back_our_autonomy_desc: "It was King Philip II of France who, in the late 12th to early 13th century, ended our autonomy in the French region. Though peasants may not have cared, the administrative body and the nobles surely did not like this and to this day, there are those who still desire autonomy once more. Perhaps it is time we take it back and ready ourselves for when there is resistance to our demands."
 promote_french_culture: "Promote French Culture"
 promote_french_culture_desc: "Though distinct as we are in the French region as we speak 'Auvergnat', a variant of the Occitan language from further south, French culture (with a tinge of Auvergnese flavor added in) is still dominant in our land. The promotion of it in our court and slowly promoting it around us through our friends and allies will ensure that we are never short of friendly neighbors in the future."
 technological_interests: "Technological Interests"
 technological_interests_desc: "Focusing on the present is one thing, but looking to the far flung future and what it holds is something few around us rarely do. Auvergne has always and will continue to hold itself to this higher standard, looking toward the future and seeking new technologies and insights where others do not, or cannot."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region. There must be a unifying force between the French people, a single polity that can seize the mantle of power and signify true dominance over the region, and we will see to it that we do our best to ensure that it is us."

 BOU_ideas_bonus: "Bourbonnean Ambition"
 siegneur_de_bourbon: "Siegneur de Bourbon"
 siegneur_de_bourbon_desc: "Though it is a bit of an outdated title, the Seigneur of Bourbon was what our rulers would be called from the period of 913 - 1327. Reclaiming the title, however, will undoubtedly give us and our people a sense of distinguished identity in the French region; after we reclaim it, keeping ourselves in good standing with the people will ensure that we are viewed as the legitimate rulers of Bourbonnais."
 legacy_of_the_first_house_of_bourbon: "First House of Bourbon"
 legacy_of_the_first_house_of_bourbon_desc: "The first run of power we had was under the first House of Bourbon, which was more or less founded by Aymon I. Charles the Simple gave him the land that are considered today 'Bourbonnais' and it is through his legacy from the first House of Bourbon that we help reinforce our authority over the land."
 ties_to_burgundy: "Ties to Burgundy"
 ties_to_burgundy_desc: "After the death of the last dynastic member of the second House of Bourbon, Archambaut IX, who died in Cyprus whilst crusading in 1249, was the one who left our land in a state of question and uncertainty. The House of Burgundy took charge afterwards and subsequently acquired the land of Bourbonnais afterwards, thus giving us external ties to what became a rival of France itself. Perhaps we can use these outside ties again in the future? It'd surely be to our benefit if we could, and did."
 defending_our_claims: "Defending our Claims"
 defending_our_claims_desc: "Our claims on the land around us, especially in the French region, are legitimate and firmly within our rights to take and annex into the lands of Bourbonnais. If those around us or around the land in question wish to challenge the authority of Bourbonnais on these claims, we will defend them vigorously with our finest noble officers riding forth gloriously against the enemy."
 royalty_in_france_proper: "Royalty in France"
 royalty_in_france_proper_desc: "The 'House of Bourbon' is still quite the renowned name in French lands; even the name 'Bourbon' is still spoken in high regard or with the knowledge that there is considerable prestige and behind the name itself. Now is the time to start building off this prestige and grandeur given to us by the people of France, and we will begin with a reformation and bolstering of the Bourbonnean soldiers."
 grace_from_charles_iv: "Grace from Charles IV"
 grace_from_charles_iv_desc: "Charles IV, last dynastic member of the House of Capet, was the one who greatly aided Bourbonnais in the early 14th century. Under him, the alliance between the Bourbons and royalty of France itself prospered and subsequently Bourbonnais was elevated to the status of 'duchy', granting us more legitimacy and prestige throughout France. If we can capitalize on this old granting of power and ride our prestige and legitimacy into the new ages ahead, Bourbonnais will become a power that none will be able to match."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region.

 seat_of_the_avignon_papacy: "Seat of the Avignon Papacy"
 seat_of_the_avignon_papacy_desc: "The memory lives on from when Avignon was the seat of power in the Catholic Church. The curia itself was moved to Avignon on March 9t, 1309 and until 1403, it remained a prime contestant for Papal power as the Papal Schism went on. Too many are forgetting when we were triumphant and powerful... Soon they will remember what made our city grand, and the people of Avignon, revered."
 avignon_exchange: "The Avignon Exchange"
 avignon_exchange_desc: "As one of the first sites of a foreign exchange market, we take pride in retaining this title and the luxuries that came with the Avignon Exchange. Not only did it promomt trade, but money lenders also found themselves at home here and with them on our side, securing beneficial loans and monetary advances will be all the more easier for us."
 renovate_and_keep_the_palais_des_papes: "Renovate the Palais des Papes"
 renovate_and_keep_the_palais_des_papes_desc: "Though not in use by the Papacy anymore, the palace and fortress her still serve important purposes for Avignon as a whole. Displaying our opulence and wealth and willingness to defend our land, renovating the Palais des Papes and keeping it in working order will undoubtedly help us learn how to fortifiy and keep our other lands outside of Avignon safe."
 papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon: "Advances of Avignon"
 papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon_desc: "The papal library and University of Avignon are some of the greatest works we have still after the fall of the last Anti-Pope, Benedict XIII. Retaining the knowledge that both produced and keeping them functioning for the city and the administration is of the utmost importance to us and Avignonese society as whole."
 build_upon_previous_developments: "Building upon our Developments"
 build_upon_previous_developments_desc: "The previous developments within Avignon, whether they be in terms of infrastructure to help bolster our society or administrative measures to assert our authority, must be constantly compounded upon for better and more lasting results. We must work things harder, make things better, do things faster, so that we, of Avignon, are stronger."
 revenge_for_the_papal_schism: "Revenge for the Papal Schism"
 revenge_for_the_papal_schism_desc: "The great Papal Schism that once empowered Avignon as a place of grandeur and wonder may be over now, but the scar it left on us is not forgotten. Revenge will be had for cutting down what once gave us prominence and power; we will take back what is rightfully ours."
 restoration_of_avignon_authority: "Restoration of Avignonese Authority"
 restoration_of_avignon_authority_desc: "The time has come to march forth and proclaim the authority of Avignon once more. Let those who oppose the might of our holy fury cower in fear or die before our weapons of steel and fire, and let those inside Avignon know that they are safe from any that wish to harm them."

 NRM_ideas_bonus: "Norman Ambition"
 ancient_contention: "Ancient Contention"
 ancient_contention_desc: "The region of Normandy has been a place rife with tension since it is valuable to those of the Isles to the north and to those just to our south. Though the tensions have often caused the Norman people much in the way of strife, it has also made us ready for whatever comes our way next."
 chateau_de_rouen: "Chateau de Rouen" 
 chateau_de_rouen_desc:"The Chateau de Rouen may be a symbol of French authority, but we can turn it from being such a thing. If we centralize our power enough amongst the Norman administration and ensure that the chateau itself is safe and maintained, it will become a symbol of Norman authority rather than just French authority."
 reassert_and_compound_on_the_norman_charter: "The Norman Charter"
 reassert_and_compound_on_the_norman_charter_desc: "The Norman Charter of 1315 was the one piece of legislation that kept Normandy afloat and at least somewhat independent of royal authority, especially during that time period since authority from the French in Paris was faltering. We will take to the Norman Charter and refine it over time, building upon what administrative qualities it instituted into Normandy itself."
 empower_norman_administrators: "Empower Norman Administrators"
 empower_norman_administrators_desc: "Keeping in line with our independent nature, we will be using more Norman administrators in our government than French ones. Those of Paris and the central part of the French region can keep to their houses and manors, the Norman people will be the ones put in charge as only they can judge and rule Normandy correctly. Once they are set in Normandy though, perhaps they can help our other lands become more centralized too? We can only hope and try."
 channel_ambitions: "Channel Ambitions"
 channel_ambitions_desc: "The Channel is one the key body of water we need to be concerned with as it holds access to the lands of the Isles and our own coasts. Trade goes into and out of the Channel and it would do us good to make sure that these routes of trade are secure for the Norman people, as opposed to others around us."
 norman_revival: "Norman Revival"
 norman_revival_desc: "Gone will the days be of the French and English attempting to subjugate us in their own names; there will be a true Norman state, for the Norman people, and it will be glorious as it goes on through history! Let our soldiers carry forth our banners proudly with skill unmatched by our enemies, and a will unbreakable by those who would want to tear us down!"

 cohesion_in_the_deccan: "Cohesion in the Deccan"
 cohesion_in_the_deccan_desc: "Our position in the region known as the Deccan is tenuous and subject to influence from seveal different shahs and rajas around us. The people of Berar must know unity and peace with each other if they are to ever see the light of tomorrow in a solemn peace the resonates throughout the entirety of the land."
 setup_forges_and_foundries: "Setup Forges and Foundries"
 setup_forges_and_foundries_desc: "Incoming foreigners occasionally bring with them strange weapons they call 'firearms' that use and explosive powder called 'gunpowder'. Though some are reluctant to use such weapons, our engineers and military officers are keen on seeing how they perform in combat against our enemies; some of the wealthy individuals from our military are even willing ot put up the money to start producing such weapons inside Berar. Since it is isn't our money going into these facilities, why stop them from being built?"
 modernizing_weaponry: "Modernizing our Weapons"
 modernizing_weaponry_desc: "The age of warfare is changing all throughout India and beyond. Slowly but surely the enemies around Berar are gaining these weapons too, thus making the battlefield equal once more. We don't need this, we need to make it favored to us once again throughout investments into new military technology and refinements in our current military weapons."
 fortification_artillery: "Fortification Artillery"
 fortification_artillery_desc: "Fortifications around Berar are fine on their own, but they lack the punch to retaliate against our enemies when they come under siege. If we begin to use artillery from defensive positions from our fortifications against besieging armies, perhaps we can also use this knowledge later on when we other armies in battle? Field artillery is something of great interest to our military officers and perhaps investing in the concept now will pay off later for Berar."
 reforming_the_succession_of_berar: "Reforming the Berari Succession"
 reforming_the_succession_of_berar_desc: "We must not focus purely on one aspect of Berar and neglecy others, especially when we can see the crumbling of various dynasties around us from time to time. We must take to reforming the succession laws of Berar and instituting more refined and strict rules regarding which heir is eligble for the throne so that in the future we can avoid succession struggles."
 meritocratic_military_organization: "Merit over Blood"
 meritocratic_military_organization_desc: "The time has come for us to phase out the aging method of nobles leading our armies into battle. Too many times has Berar seen its good men cut down by a leader who was supposed to be bright and capable because he was born of a grand family tree, no, this must change for the Berari military. There will be military academies set up and there will be skill-based recruitment of commanders; the nobles deserve less than we give them."
 sustain_ourselves_from_aggression: "Sustain Ourselves from Aggression"
 sustain_ourselves_from_aggression_desc: "The rivals around us show no signs of resting, and neither do we. For decades now, the Berari people have focused on outward expansion and neglected to think of their own safety and their own walls that should keep them safe. Perhaps it is time for a slight shift, for, defensive measures are also in the interests of Berar, just as offensive measures are."
 GOC_ideas: "Golcanda Ideas"
 GOC_ideas_start: "Golconda Traditions"
 GOC_ideas_bonus: "Golconda Ambition"
 persian_origins: "Persian Origins"
 persian_origins_desc: "Our nobles and rulers can trace their origins to the region of Persia itself, bringing with them a plethora of knowledge and ideas from outside India. Spreading these ideas and fusing them with Indian ideas on various matters can lead to a rich cultural exchange that Golconda would be foolish to not look into and take advantage of."
 patronize_learning_and_buildings: "Patronize Learning and Buildings"
 patronize_learning_and_buildings_desc: "Though our origins lay far away, we have come to adopt the language and customs of the Telugu and surrounding people groups. Combining our knowledge from Persia with the likes of Indian and Muslim engineers to construct elaborate structures that are both prestigious and functional will allow Golconda to flourish in the future in the fields of innovation and grandeur."
 golconda_diamonds: "Golconda Diamonds"
 golconda_diamonds_desc: "The rich diamond mine within our territory provides wealth beyond belief, as some would say. Though we carefully cultivate the production of diamonds and gems in our land, we should not be so strict that we inadvertently hinder our income. Reworking and refining our production methods over time will likely ensure that profit margins are firmly in favor of Golconda."
 golconda_fort: "Golconda Fort"
 golconda_fort_desc: "The fortress within our capital is not something that should be taken lightly. It is our duty to keep it taken care of and manned whenever necessary so as to keep our capital safe from invaders, but also to help be an example of how to build future fortifications in different areas we come to control."
 adopt_deccani_culture: "Adopting Deccani Culture"
 adopt_deccani_culture_desc: "The myriad of peopel groups in the Deccan are briming with opportunity, but also tension, and the administrators of Golconda can see this quite clearly. There must be sustained efforts by our administration to adopt and integrate these different groups of people in the Deccan into Golconda as a whole, thus making Golconda more unified as a whole."
 fight_against_the_vijayanagara_empire: "Against the Vijayanagara Empire"
 fight_against_the_vijayanagara_empire_desc: "To our south is the mighty and fearsome Vijayanagara Empire. Though powerful in many ways, we of Golconda are powerful as well and not willing to let the wrath of the Vijayanagara Empire wash over our land without a fight. To the very last man, Golconda will fight! The Sultanate of Bahmanis may not have been able to do this, but we succeed where they failed at and hold off the threats from the south!"
 centralized_deccani_sultanate: "Centralize the Sultanate"
 centralized_deccani_sultanate_desc: "As time moves forward, so to do our people. It won't be long before new technologies present new challenges to our authority, which is why we will need more active efforts to centralize power throughout the land into an orderly form. It won't be easy, but it will be worth the effort in the end."

 sufis_of_bijapur_desc: "The gracious sufis of our land have been here since a couple centuries ago, helping form communities become more in line with Islam itself and also promoting the connections between Hindu and Muslim communities spread throughout. Despite harsh treatment early on in their arrival, the sufis have since increased in number and have brought a sense of wider community to Bijapur as a whole."
 capital_of_commerce_and_culture: "Commerical and Cultural Hub"
 capital_of_commerce_and_culture_desc: "Our capital is something of a gem in the central part of India. Being a place of great commerce and culture, our leaders know how to cultivate a thriving hub of merchants and civilians alike as they come from different backgrounds and different regions. Let us continue this great trend and build up our capital to be an economic and cultural heart in India, greater than the cities in the north like Delhi and Lahore!"
 palmyra_of_the_deccan: "The Palmyra of the Deccan"
 palmyra_of_the_deccan_desc: "Bijapur, due to our efforts in making sure it is a place for culture and commerce and a place where people from all over India can come and feel as though they are at home, is being nicknamed the 'Palmyra of the Deccan'. The namy 'Palmyra' may be a bit lost on us, but it brings with it apparent prestige and good tidings, so we will gladly adopt it."
 southward_ambitions: "Southward Ambitions"
 southward_ambitions_desc: "The south is where our most fearsome competition lies, rather than the north. The Hindu leaders that oppose our might and who would see Bijapur fall into disrepair will know our might and the superiority of our troops; our ambitions will be satiated once we secure the southern realms, and after that, perhaps even other areas."
 new_age_of_indian_warfare: "New Age of Indian Warfare"
 new_age_of_indian_warfare_desc: "Gunpowder is continuously making its way into the field of battle at every turn. From two-handed weapons to full on cannons that can breach the walls of stone fortresses, the soldiers of Bijapur are going to need to adapt to this new age of warfare and be the first to use it effectively in India."
 develop_the_water_systems_and_hospitals: "Develop Water Systems and Hospitals"
 develop_the_water_systems_and_hospitals_desc: "The water systems of India are often lacking in how clean they are and how refined they could be, as are the hospitals and medical areas around the region. Bijapur has scholars from around its land who are ready to help innovate on both of these fronts if we take them up on their offers, letting the people of Bijapur know both increased health and an increased quality of life."
 institute_educational_systems: "Institute Educational Systems"
 institute_educational_systems_desc: "One common controversey that keeps coming up amongst the population of Bijapur is education. More classical ways of education may have been fine in the past for our ancestors, but in a time of increasingly diversifying ways of thought, especially on how education should be conducted and instituted in Bijapuri land, we must be open to new ways of thinking and reforming what we have in place. Bijapur must not be stuck in the past."

 fall_of_bahmanis: "Fall of Bahmanis"
 fall_of_bahmanis_desc: "The Sultanate of Bahmanis is a mere decaying remnant of the past and its successors are here to stay. We of Ahmednagar will be the most righteous and fearsome of the successors, uniting the Deccan either through diplomacy or conquest."
 the_fall_of_daulatabad_fort: "The Capture of Daulatabad"
 the_fall_of_daulatabad_fort_desc: "The mighty citadel at Daulatabad stood as a hefty barrier for the Sultanate of Bahmanis, but they have fallen from grace now and have left vast amounts of land and power open for the taking. With our taking of Daulatabad early on, we learned just how important it was to focus on siege tactics and what a prolonged siege requires, making Ahmednagari forces all the better in prolonged wars."
 distiniguished_amongst_deccani_sultans: "Distinguished in the Deccan"
 distiniguished_amongst_deccani_sultans_desc: "The Deccan requires strong leadership and dedicated sultans to lead it! The people in the region cannot be left to the hungry powers of Orissa, Gujarat, Malwa, or the Vijayanagara Empire, no, Ahmednagar must prove itself worthy as a righteous Muslim state that can succeed where the Bahmani sultans failed."
 blood_on_the_royal_dynasty: "Blood on our Dynasty"
 blood_on_the_royal_dynasty_desc: "Whilst we are sorting out many things in Ahmednagar, from agricultural reforms to tax laws and so much more, we are faced with the fact that our succession to the throne is not always secure and clear. We need to ensure that previous bloody feuds between advisors and family members of our dynasty are sorted out through courts so that a clear heir may be found and put forth for Ahmednagar."
 reformation_of_revenue_intake: "Ahmednagari Taxation Reform"
 reformation_of_revenue_intake_desc: "Being focused on warfare and politics for so long makes it so that we lack the ability to focus on other key areas. Other regions such as the Gangetic Plain and the Bengal Delta are working toward land and taxation reforms that Ahmednagar could seriously stand to benefit from. Perhaps we can send envoys to these places to bring back details of these reforms."
 ahmednagar_renovations: "Frontier Fortifications"
 ahmednagar_renovations_desc: "We cannot neglect the fortifications scattered around Ahmednagar as time goes on. Sure they may have been good at the time they were built, but we need to be maintainers of these fortifications as well, improving them whenever we can with improved materials or new designs."
 persianate_acceptance: "Akin to the Persian World"
 persianate_acceptance_desc: "Much like the cities of Isfahan, Herat, and Tabriz, Ahmednagar (the city) must be a haven not just for those of Persian descent, but rather it must be a haven for all who wish to be part of its growing culture, expansive neighborhoods, and thriving business community. We cannot just turn away Gujarati, Oriya, and Marathi people and deny them access to our great city if we wish to continue to prosper."

 learn_from_the_northern_qi_desc: "Much like the Southern Qi, the Northern Qi was plagued with issues during its short time in the mid-6th century.

 lessons_of_the_southern_qi: "Lessons of the Southern Qi"
 lessons_of_the_southern_qi_desc: "Much like the Northern Qi, the Southern Qi was rife with problems, chief among which were rebellions and corruption at all levels of government. The arbitrary executions carried out and curtailing of certain officials for menial reasons must be learned from, for the banners of Qi must not be stained with horrid acts that destroy the nation from the inside out."
 reformation_of_military_ranks: "Reformation of Military Ranks"
 reformation_of_military_ranks_desc: "Cleaning up the mess that is the Middle Kingdom is no easy task, and the military ranks of Qi are something that will be needed in order to help clean up said mess.

 cultivate_a_cohesive_court: "Cultivate a Cohesive Court"
 cultivate_a_cohesive_court_desc: "The court of Qi is the central part of matters where things can and have gone wrong in the past.

 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 reform_the_land_taxes_and_grain_desc: "Li Zicheng advocated for reformations to the way in which grain-tax system as well as to how land was divided and given out to the people.

 support_from_scholars_and_officials_desc: "The support of scholars and those accomplished officials that are scattered throughout the Middle Kingdom are key to achieving what Great Shun needs: legitimacy and satiation of the population. Once we have them on our side, which we are always actively taking steps to achieve, we will be better capable of dealing with our the internal matters of the nation."
 fight_for_authority: "Fight for Authority"
 fight_for_authority_desc: "The Middle Kingdom is rarely ever a cohesive and stable entity as threats from the outside constantly knock at the doors from the outside and dangers internally are consistently threatening the stability of the holder of the Mandate of Heaven. Great Shun may be seen as yet another to be fated to this same dangerous fate, but we will ensure that we take measures to secure our successes when we obtain them, but before then, we we will need to make sure that our fight to get there is in firmly within our hands; that is, the hands of the ones who are obedient to heaven itself."

 from_chengdu_to_xijing_desc: "Though Chengdu is often seen as merely a western trade hub near those of Tibet and Yunnan, it is much more than that. Being fertile for agriculture and the place where our rebellions began, it will serve as our spiritual and administrative capital, and will be proclaimed as 'Xijing', or, Western Capital."
 cut_down_opposition: "Cut Down Opposition"
 cut_down_opposition_desc: "The rebellious people that think they would overthrow the Daxi Dynasty are foolish in their thoughts and attempts. Some would defect to the defunct Ming Dynasty or to other lords, but they know not what they do or what they say. We will teach them through force that loyalty to the Daxi Dynasty is rewarded, and opposition will absolutely be cut down."

 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 tenuous_stance_by_french_royalty: "Tenuous Stance"
 tenuous_stance_by_french_royalty_desc: "The French nobility have never been truly fond of the Foixien people and their local rulers, which is why we are only emboldened when they come knocking at our doors for undue fealty. Drive them away and show them that the swords and muskets of Foix stand ready to stand against those who demand respect rather than earn it!"
 fortify_the_castle_of_foix: "Fortify the Castle of Foix"
 fortify_the_castle_of_foix_desc: "It would do us good to renovate and keep up with the maintenance of the castle of Foix since it can be, in time, used as an example for other fortresses in our land. If we have a set plan for how they should be built and maintained, we can cheapen the cost of keeping them in service and in conjunction keep Foix even safer."

 close_ties_to_the_royalty_desc: "The nobility of Champagne benefit not only us internally, but also externally when they intermingle with other branches of other states.

 inheritor_of_france_desc: "Our proximity and our close ties with the French royalty have garnered us a prestigious title that, though informal, is recognized by many throughout our realm and those beyond it: The Inheritor of France.

 the_eastern_border_desc: "To our east are the Germanic peoples of the Holy Roman Empire. Though divided and arguing constantly, they pose a serious threat to the French people, most importantly those of Champagne.

 the_diplomatic_game: "The Diplomatic Game"
 the_diplomatic_game_desc: "Diplomacy is the art of working through words and papers to get done what could be done with the bloodshed and conflict.

Those of Dauphine were part of this rise in localized power and were at first an Imperial Fief of the Holy Roman Empire, but soon were under French rulership. Such connections in both Francien and German realms gives Dauphine a unique lineage to draw upon, one that shall not be put to waste anytime soon."

 the_savoy_daphine_conflicts_desc: "In the 12th century, early in the history of Dauphine itself, the borders were much less firm and much more subject to change. As a result, when titles were changed and cities shifted hands, power struggles emerged over miscommunication and various disputes, the prime example we have being the disputes between Savoy and Dauphine over cities like Voiron and la Cota-Saint-Andre and the Faucigny. Such conflicts do not fade into history so easily and we retain the potential to claim land that our ancestors once had."
 french_military_service: "French Military Service"
 french_military_service_desc: "Dauphinois nobles have in the past served well in the French military, standing out at certain battles and often being recognized for their hard work for the royal domain.

 sort_out_the_noble_feuds_desc: "Nobles fueding with each other is one of the utmost problems that we can face as a state and nation. Quarrels between them can last years and drain several resources from Dauphine itself, which we absolutely do not want or need. We must take action now and ensure that we cut noble families off from vital domains and resources within Dauphine so that we can prevent any major collapse from even having a chance at starting."

 the_question_of_ming_succession_desc: "The Ming Dynasty is but a fleeting dream in the minds of several groups of people in both peasant and noble circles. Those of Ning are some of the most keen on seeing this declining dynasty that does not deserve the Mandate of Heavean turned into paper and ink on the shelves of history, and we are only all too happy to proclaim that the question of who will succeed the Ming Dynasty, will be those of Ning."

 coercion_leads_to_deals: "Coercion and Deals"
 coercion_leads_to_deals_desc: "Part of how Zhu Chenhao got his start in garnering support for his cause was through bribery and backroom deals with various officials in and around the Chinese courts.

 claiming_or_making_the_throne_desc: "The throne of the Ming Dynasty is seen by many to be riddled with flaws and corruption, lacking in what it takes to truly be something that can hold the Mandate of Heaven. The question then comes to us: Do we claim the throne and polish it in order to put proper order in where the previous emperors once faltered, or do we make a new throne for ourselves and proclaim a new age? Regardless of which we choose, our military zeal will ensure that we are successful in reaching this point, for Ning can be the only true successor in the Middle Kingdom."

 core_at_nanchang_desc: "Nanchang is not only fertile ground for agriculture and commerce, but it is also ready for infrastructure developments that we, the administrators of Ning, are ready to fund.

Those of Nanchang that were once staunch activists against us are becoming sympathetic to our cause, and those who rallied to our cause at first are spreading the fervor elsewhere.

In the time since we've been away, however, innovations have been had that we must incorporate actively into our own military if we are to become a true military force once more.

It was and still is considered a great honor and a show of power to have such subjects and we are only all too willing to once again flaunt our power in this way.

 dominating_trade_sectors_desc: "We were the preeminent holders of the eastern and central parts of the Silk Road when we holders of the Mandate of Heaven.

In these turbulent times, politics have shifted and a new age is upon the people of the Tang Dynasty, an age that will see them reclaim what they lost so long ago. No longer will they stand by and watch pretender after pretender seize the throne of the Middle Kingdom, corrupting it further with each new ruler; we will restore the balance of power, and reclaim what glory we lost so long ago."

 prosperous_northern_roots_desc: "We hail from the northern parts of the Middle Kingdom, renowned for its fertility in agriculture and prosperity as a hot spot for urban growth. By cultivating the image and the memory of the Great Yan Dynasty in the hearts and minds of the northern people, we can obtain a steady stream of recruits willing to fight for us, and with this in mine, perhaps we can soon spread our message into other parts fo the Middle Kingdom."
 revise_succession_laws: "Revise Succession Laws"
 revise_succession_laws_desc: "One of the key factors that undercut An Lushan and his rebellion after he proclaimed the Great Yan Dynasty was the matter of succession, for his son did end up killing him in the end, causing a major succession struggle to ensue. What we need is a reformation of succession laws and how our heirs rank in comparison to each other so that we do not suffer what An Lushan did."
 soldiers_from_many_regions: "Soldiers from many Regions"
 soldiers_from_many_regions_desc: "Part of the nature of An Lushan's rebellion was that it was multi-ethnic. People from as far as away as Sogdia came to fight for his side and Arabs fought alongside Chinese soldiers as mercenaries in the entire struggle. As such, we will cultivate a diverse military just like he did and though we may have to pay a little extra to do this, it will work to bring greater prosperity through defense and offense to the Great Yan Dynasty."

 help_from_the_north_desc: "Shatuo Turks were of importance to the Later Liang due to the fact that Emperor Taizu had to maintain tense relations with them since he had a previous rivalry with Li Keyong, governor of Shanxi province. Later on though, the Shatuo Turks proved useful as military aids to various parts of the Middle Kingdom and it is that aid from the northern people that we maintain.

 tenuous_chinese_authority_desc: "We find ourselves far from any firm authority from the Middle Kingdom itself. Nanjing, the supposed 'southern capital' is so far from us that rarely any Zhuang people have travelled to and from it, recounting it for our people in depth. With this in mind, we are often left to ourselves and governing our land in the ways we have cultivated over the centuries is much better when compared to top-down laws of force by the Chinese from afar."

The Zhuang people looked up to them as they repelled armies from the Chinese in 751 and 754, but we could not do the same, unfortunately. Still, their example of unity amidst the onslaught of Chinese forces glows brightly as an example for our people to follow."

 rid_ourselves_of_tribal_complexes_desc: "Perhaps it is a reason as to why our people are so weak at promoting influence beyond Guangxi; tribes and clans from around the area we inhabit are always keen on gaining or usurping power from the others, but anytime this happens, great feuds erupt and atrocities are witnessed that should never happen. It is because of these past experiences that we must learn to transcend them and break the ties that bind us to the tribal networks of the past. It will be tough to do so, but it will be well worth the effort."

 retain_and_refine_shogongism_moism_desc: "The traditional religious practices of the Zhuang people are strange when compared to the Buddhists to the south, or the Confucians in the rest of the Middle Kingdom. Though we have adopted some practices from both regions, Moism is still prevalent in Zhuang society and with it being foundational for our people, there is a sense that it must be refined and cultivated as time goes on. If we do this and actively work to help reform it into a state religion, the Zhuang people may seen unity on yet another level crucial for sustaining a prospering state."

Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 migrations_of_the_hakka_desc: "Our origins lay in the north of where we curently reside, but constant periods of unrest have made it impossible for us to sustain life up there. Thus, we migrated over the centuries to where we reside currently, and though we lost many traditions from these migrations, we have gained crucial insight into moving lightly and with haste, something the others around us can't match in the slightest."
 productive_potential_in_the_earth: "Productive Potential"
 productive_potential_in_the_earth_desc: "There lies potential not in the agriculture of where we live, but rather in the hills and mountains. Precious metals used in various sectors of daily life, from building materials to military weapons, can be found deep within the hills which we claim as our own. By investing effort and time into mining these places, we will see profits for the Hakka people that match what is needed for a prosperous future."

 distinct_chinese_identity_desc: "We are not like the other Chinese around us, and they know this just as well as we do. We speak a different dialect and a perform different rituals and customs that may be similar to their own, but still there are differences that set us apart and leave us vulnerable to persecution, which we have endured for ages without end. Now, though, we may finally fight back and see to it that the Hakka people are not shunned and executed for being simply who they are."
 promote_the_dragon_deities: "Promote the Dragon Deities"
 promote_the_dragon_deities_desc: "Also distinct from the other Chinese people in the Middle Kingdom, the Hakka people are fond of the dragon deities passed down from ages ago. Rarely found elsewhere, the dragon deities help strengthen our faith and worship of our ancestors and we will continue promoting them throughout our land."
 build_toulous: "Tulou, Earthen Buildings"
 build_toulous_desc: "Tulou are traditional communal buildings built by our people for generations and they serve not only as great living spaces, but also partially as defensive structures that can help stave off enemy invasions. If we build upon this mentality and work toward making some tulou into a more defensive structure, perhaps they will prove useful as fortresses in the future. Certainly no one will see these coming as only the Hakka people have built them and readily continue to build them."

 carve_out_a_place_for_the_hakka_desc: "The existence of the Hakka people has been one of turmoil and chaos, full of unrest and persecution from various groups in the Middle Kingdom. Will we know peace some day? Will we be able to carve out a place for ourselves to live in peace and prosperity? In a place without tension and persecution? Perhaps not anytime soon, but it is certainly something we can work toward."

 resisting_central_chinese_authority: "Resisting Central Chinese Authority"
 resisting_central_chinese_authority_desc: "There is a reason why there has never been a dynasty with their capital fixed in the southern parts of the Middle Kingdom, and it is because of how resistant and distinct the south is from the north. Time and time again they have tried to rein us in, but still there is resistance and eventual autonomy given to the Yue people. Now that we are free once more, the others can be sure that they will not have an easy time taking us back into the fold."

 the_legacy_of_goujian_against_wu_desc: "One of our most famous kings, Goujian, destroyed and annexed the petty state of Wu in 473BC and set an example of just how powerful the southern people of the Middle Kingdom can be. It is partially because of his example that we continue to try to be ready militarily for whatever comes our way, lest we fail and succumb to foreign incursions or internal decadance."
 keepers_of_the_southern_waters: "Keepers of the Southern Waters"
 keepers_of_the_southern_waters_desc: "The waters in the south of the Middle Kingdom are rife with trade from far off places that hold several different goods and resources unique as compared to what is found locally. We must protect these trade routes and water ways from those further north so that the prosperity comes solely to us, and once that is established, naval dominance is a mere small step away."
 connections_to_the_vietnamese: "Connections to the Viet People"
 connections_to_the_vietnamese_desc: "The Yue people are connected to the Viet people in at least some tangential fashion and this is evident through our history that dates back to the Nanyue Kingdom. By building relations with the Viet people and cultivating prosperous ties with key Viet officials, we can begin to bridge the gap betweent he two people groups and once again fight against the hegemony attempting to be imposed on from the north."
 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together: "Blending of Administrations"
 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together_desc: "The traditional administative structure of the Middle Kingdom was something foreign to the Yue people before, but as the Nanyue Kingdom became more closely tied to the Han Dynasty, the administration of both became slowly intertwined. By cultivating this blending of administrative methods more and taking the best of both sides, we can effectively govern the Yue people and state through both reformist and traditionalist methods."
 the_great_nanyue_kingdom: "The Great Nanyue Kingdom"
 the_great_nanyue_kingdom_desc: "Though seemingly gone from the memory of many, the Nanyue Kingdom is still around in the hearts and minds of several Yue people. Our descent from it to today is miraculous and intriguing to say the least, but now that there is again an independent Yue state, there can finally be a proper and legitimate successor to the kingdom of old."

 maritime_investments: "Maritime Investments"
 maritime_investments_desc: "The position of the Min domain is such that maritime affairs are unavoidable. Instead of doing so, we will engage with maritime trade and warfare and seek to dominate it; if we can secure the coastal waters around the Middle Kingdom for ourselves, we will have a much easier time promoting and forcing our access to the interior."

 discard_the_memory_of_the_yin_dynasty_desc: "One of the sons of Wang Shenzhi rebelled against him and proclaimed himself the 'Yin Dynasty', a bitter memory in which we are eager to stamp out entirely. It brought great disunity to the Min people; we simply can't let it happen again in any shape or form, for a united Min is what is needed, not a divided one."

 succeed_where_we_failed_southern_tang_desc: "The Southern Tang took advantage of the disunity within the Min Kingdom and our allegiance to Wuyue was not able to hold off the onslaught of the Southern Tang. We must learn from the lessons in warfare they taught us and curate a better and more robust military, starting from the core of things: the infantry."
 out_of_isolation: "Out of Isolation"
 out_of_isolation_desc: "The trade routes through the coastal waters may seem to be a good way at getting us out of isolation, but in truth they only get us contacts, not formal relations. We must bring ourselves truly out of isolation from the southern reaches and into a new age of outreach and diplomacy if we hope to survive and thrive."

 marriage_and_purchase: "Marriage and Purchase"
 marriage_and_purchase_desc: "Through the expertise of our old counts, Armagnac increased in both size and power throughout the 13th and 14th century. Marriages were crucial in securing the land we now call home, and purchases of various plots of land from other nobles and families was also key to our fortune. As such, we have garnered a considerable amount of influence around us, and even more power within our own domain."
 no_to_the_black_prince: "Turn Away from the Black Prince"
 no_to_the_black_prince_desc: "When Edward the Black Prince was given control over our lands in 1360, he sought to use the Armagnac people to his advantage. Taxes beyond belief were levied from the people, but they said no and refused his harsh authority and instead appealed to the French royal court instead. It is this resistance to the English and favoring of those who understand us better, those of French descent, that we must keep alive."
 enemies_of_burgundy: "Enemies of Burgundy"
 enemies_of_burgundy_desc: "The feudal politics of the early 15th century resulted in hostile sentiment being stirred against Burgundy within Armagnac. Though we aren't as keen to be under direct royal authority from Paris, the Burgundians are even worse and as such, the people of Armagnac are slowly uniting against these foul people in order to rid them of Europe once and for all."
 armagnac_mercenaries: "Armagnac Mercenaries"
 armagnac_mercenaries_desc: "The Armagnacs, formed by Count Bernard VII, may be vicious and fearsome and often hard to lock down in formal contracts of service, but they know their origins in Armagnac itself. Though most were incorporated into the French military itself, there are still bands out there, ready to serve as grand mercenaries once more if we are willing to pay the price."
 sustain_armagnac_power: "Sustain Armagnac Power"
 sustain_armagnac_power_desc: "The usage of the Armagnacs previously has not only helped garner good tidings with them, but even military tactics and strategies are being shared with them too. Though some might think this is a bit far since they are still technically mercenaries, we know their loyalty lies within their homeland and will grant them services from our military itself."
 resist_the_royal_domain: "Resist the Royal Domain"
 resist_the_royal_domain_desc: "We are on the outer reaches of the French region, far from where royal power is absolute and easily enforced. We must resist the encroachment of these royalists at any cost, whether it is turning away their diplomatic intrigue or fighting their knights and soldiers on the field. Undoubtedly they will want to rein us in, but we will resist as much as we can in order to see an independent and glorious Armagnac."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region.

 sophias_power_desc: "From 1033 to 1093, after the death of Frederick III, Duke of Upper Lorraine, the cunning and grand Countess of Bar, Sophie, expanded the territory of Bar through various methods of political and diplomatic intrigue along with conquest and purchase. Even her descendants continued this path of expansion and brought Bar to grand prominence as a de facto independent border state betwixt the Germans and the French people. It is because of her that we owe our existence and fortune."
 french_politics_over_german_politics: "French Politics over German Politics"
 french_politics_over_german_politics_desc: "In deciding which side of the fence we'd be on, our French lineage dictated that we side with and become entrenched in French politics over German politics. As such, centuries of intermarriage and intrigue followed our choice and we have been quite prominent in our time within the French region."

 a_peer_of_france_desc: "A title bestowed upon nobles of distinction in the French region, the Count of Bar was recognized as one in 1354, leading it to become even more influential throughout French lands. Those who know how much power we wield and how firm our authority is will yield to us more easily, thanks in part to this prestigious title."
 ties_to_lorraine: "Ties to Lorraine"
 ties_to_lorraine_desc: "From the outset, the Duchy of Bar has been undoubtedly tied to Lorraine and its rulers.

 using_the_status_of_duchy: "Use the status of 'Duchy'"
 using_the_status_of_duchy_desc: "Being a duchy carries weight when speaking to others in the French region and even those in neighboring regions.

 fortify_the_lands_of_bar: "Fortify the Lands of Bar"
 fortify_the_lands_of_bar_desc: "Being initially a border state of sorts has had a inherent defensive affect on us. We have learned to defend ourselves first, before taking to attacking others, and this defenisve mentality must be promoted over time if Barrois land is to remain safe and secure. Better defensive measures will be found and implemented; the walls and garrisons of Bar will not go down without a fight fit for the ages."

 legacy_of_the_jaquerie_peasant_revolt_desc: "The peasant revolt during the Hundred Years' War othat took place in our land was significant in that, it rallied the people to a common cause and it greatly worried the nobility of the time.

 extinct_house_of_belleme_desc: "Though they are no longer around, the House of Belleme helped build the foundation of Alencon and gave us a reputation to begin building off of.

 ties_through_roger_de_montgomery_desc: "Roger de Montgomery of the 11th century may have started his life elsewhere, but his influence eventually stretched into the French region where him and his descendants gained substantial influence in Alenconnais land.

 juniors_of_the_royal_family_desc: "Though not quite a cadet branch, we are often related to the royal family themselves and seen as a sort of 'junior' part to them.

He was a patron of artistry that took on the Flemish and Parisian style of the time period, whilst also blending it with Italian styles such as the panel-painting techniques.

The splitting of the entire nation during the civil war allowed for Ballala III from Hoysala and later Malik Kafur from the Delhi Sultanate to invade the nation, leading to a great decline in the nation over all.

Would the people of Venad once again be subject to foreign rule?

 fighting_on_the_plains_desc: "Though tranquil in the minds of some, the plains are actually quite hostile with several small tribes raiding others for resources and capitves.

 fixed_villages_of_the_wichita_desc: "Our settlements are well known and becoming more and more expansive as time goes on. Several developments are being made to help promote them as centers of population growth and some in our higher circles are thinking that it is high time that we establish other fixed villages elsewhere to promote Wichita authority and prosperity. If we can organize this effort properly and gather enough people for it, perhaps there will be truth to this idea after all."

 skilled_in_trade_and_agriculture_desc: "We have taken up agricultural life many generations ago and over time we have come to be known for how well we till the land and produce vast quantities of resources for our own people. Not only this, but our trading skills are some of the best around, so combining both areas of skill will ensure that revenue is never an issue for us." 
 a_wichita_confederation: "A Wichita Confederation"
 a_wichita_confederation_desc: "Though the different branches of the Wichita people are separated by distance, there is unity between them. Even some have drifted away from us and have intermingled with other tribes, but still they retain loyalty to the greater Wichita whole and as such, we have the grounds for a confederation, transcending past tribal roots and into something greater."
 marking_the_wichita_people: "Marking the Wichita People"
 marking_the_wichita_people_desc: "If there is one thing we will retain as we go on throughout time, it is the marking of our people around the eyes. It is significant in our culture and also serves to mark our people as distinct from others around us. It is a rather simple, but effective tradition that will serve to keep the Wichita people known and our society, distinct."
 formalize_the_wichita_military: "Formalize the Wichita Military"
 formalize_the_wichita_military_desc: "To go along with the foundations of a Wichita confederation of people, there will need to be a reformation of military structures. Tribal levies will no longer do and our old tactics must be refined and combined with newer ones in order to ensure proper deployment, engagement, and disengagement. It will take some time to do, but as an upcoming nation, there is plenty of time, resources, and will to get it done."

 arapaho_warrior_culture_desc: "Much of our culture is based around the figure of warriors themselves. They play a very large part in Arapaho society and they are trained to be highly disciplined throughout life. So long as the Arapaho are around, the spirit of the warrior within the people will remain."
 expanding_the_arapaho_grounds: "Expanding Arapaho Grounds"
 expanding_the_arapaho_grounds_desc: "It is not enough that we control land tenuously and that other tribes think they can simply intrude onto what is rightfully our land without consequence.

 prepare_for_diplomatic_shifts_desc: "Though our long lasting friendships may do us well later on, they are not guaranteed to be stable throughout time.

 formalize_arapaho_divisons_desc: "The Arapaho people have traditionally been divided into five groups: the 'Southern People', the 'Rock People', the 'Arapaho Proper', the 'Big Lodge People', and the 'White Clay People'. By formalizing these divisions and introducing reforms to help divide up administrative tasks equally and fairly, the governing body of the Arapaho people will become more efficient."

 the_arapaho_nation_desc: "With an ever changing world around the Arapaho people, there is a need to adapt with what comes forth, whether it be in terms of technological innovations or in terms of government structure.

 connections_to_and_after_the_second_cheras_desc: "After the disappeareance of the Second Cheras in the early 12th century, Kolathunad and the Kolathiris were one of the benefactors in the partition of the kingdom. With their memory still around amidst the people of Kolathunad, there is a certain reputation that we have for being seen as a sort of successor to them. With this reputation, people of Tamil lineage often come to our court looking for work in a state seen as the proper successor to the Second Cheras, which we style ourselves as."

 combat_in_kerala_desc: "Kerala is not for the uninitiated. It's jungles and harsh terrain make survival and fighting here a nightmare for many.

 organized_decentralization_desc: "We never have nor do exercise true absolute political power over the people of Koluthunad. We share our power with other officials and divisions of people so as to keep our state in working order and as such it has led to a great amount of success in regards to keeping tensions in local communities at a minimum."

 balance_the_matrilinial_divisions_desc: "The five matrilinial-divisions of the Kolathiri family serve to bolster administative efforts throughout Kolathunad, not just in the capital city. They are spread out in the land and work to keep taxation, communication, paperwork, and other administrative matters in order, and if we keep them alive and well, we will see rising support for our efforts, particularly military ones."

 source_of_heirs_to_others_desc: "If there is one thing that Koluthnad has been known for to others around Kerala and elsewhere in India, it is that we are a source of viable heirs for other dynasties. Though we may not have claimed thrones and titles like others might have, the children chosen as heirs for other dynasties have grown to be strong members and as such our reputation to those around us is something beyond just 'a neighbor'."

 cultivate_the_kolathiri_court_desc: "Throughout time, the Kolathiri court is something that remains central to Kolathunad. Other things may change around the state, but the court is where we see the past and present meet and come into harmonious contact with each other.

 six_major_apache_speaking_groups_desc: "The major groups of Apache speaking people may not be as close-knit as other groups of similarly speaking people, but we still recognize and commonality between all of us and that there should be unity over feuding. Though this doesn't always work out, it does for the most part and serves to bring more plentiful amounts of fighters for the Apache."
 early_nomadic_traditions: "Early Nomadic Traditions"
 early_nomadic_traditions_desc: "There was a time when we migrated to a great number of places and across vast amounts of land, hunting and seeking survival in the various conditions around us. Though we are not nearly as nomadic as before, the traditions that came with that way of life still influence the Apache people and make them much quicker on their feet."
 taking_to_settled_life: "Taking to Settled Life"
 taking_to_settled_life_desc: "Settled life is something rather strange to some Apache people, but to most it is the natural progression from where we once were. Let us promote settle life and agriculture to the Apache people but also provide ample grounds to continue our old traditions so that we do not alienate our elders or our ancestors."
 tribal_exchanges: "Tribal Exchanges"
 tribal_exchanges_desc: "The various tribes all around us have been long time trading partners and have imparted wisdom onto us, as well us onto them.

 apache_cavalry_desc: "The foreigners who dare encroach on our lands bring death and destruction to the Apache people, but the tools they use can be very handy for us in the future.

 firearms_and_raiding: "Firearms and Raiding"
 firearms_and_raiding_desc: "Taking up the advanced weaponry of our enemies is becoming a standard thing for the Apache people, yet still we can go further with them.

 formalize_apacheria_desc: "It's a strange concept to some, but a state for the Apache people to live in peace with themselves and those who are peaceful to them is a laudible goal to strive for.

 partition_of_the_second_cheras: "Partition of the Second Cheras"
 partition_of_the_second_cheras_desc: "The fragmenting and partition of the Second Chera Empire changed the landscape of Tamilakam forever. The would-be successors all vied for land and no state directly related to them could attain the power they used to hold. Still, the remnants that live on today, us being one of them, are seen as the legitimate successors who carry on the legacy of this once great dynasty."
 conquer_by_courting_and_conferring_death: "'Cattum konnum adakki kolka'"
 conquer_by_courting_and_conferring_death_desc: "The Ernad Utayavar (governor) was given a royal sword by the last Cherman Perumal, Rama Varma Kulasekhara; with it, he was given the order to 'conquer by courting and conferring death', and with this motiviation and authority, he set out to conquer the territories of the kingdom of Polanad and beyond. It is this foundation from the Eradis that we obtain our military prowess from, and it something we must never forget."
 strategic_coastal_access:  "Strategic Coasts"
 strategic_coastal_access_desc: "The land on the coast of Kozhikode (Calicut) is rife with potential and for maritime trade, as our neighbors have no doubt exploited over the years. If we are to maintain our position as a significant power in Kerala and indeed in Southern India as a whole, we must learn to use our strategic position to bolster our revenue streams and our naval authority."
 lessons_from_subjugating_rivals: "Lessons from Internal Struggles"
 lessons_from_subjugating_rivals_desc: "Before Kozhikode was a unified state, there were several rivals vying for dominance through countless conflicts and dynastic disputes. The title 'Samoothiri of Kozhikode' came about as a result trials and tribulations internally that hardened the people of the area into ones that are ready to face any threat against them, whether they are from within Tamilakam or outside of it."
 matrilineal_succession_system: "Matrilinial Succession System"
 matrilineal_succession_system_desc: "Though it may come as an unusual system to those outside of Kerala, the way of succession in Kozhikode is matrilineal in nature and has been so for centuries now. Keeping this tradition and ensuring it does not become interrupted or rife with corruption is a top priority for us as the system itself helps keep the populace and the administration satiated."
 implement_superior_economic_policies: "Implement Superior Economic Policies"
 implement_superior_economic_policies_desc: "The Samoothiri of Kozhikode must have a keen eye not only for administrative matters and military affairs, but also for economic policies. The waters around Southern India and the trade routes snaking throughout the region are rife with potential for increased revenue, especially through the port at Kozhikode, but we must be ready to put through policies that are directly beneficial to this."
 patronize_religious_scholars: "Patronize Religious Scholars"
 patronize_religious_scholars_desc: "Religious scholars from several places have travelled to Kozhikode to make a living from trading, but several have also looked to settle down in our land to promote theological debate and religious conversion. Though we are less than eager to let them simply convert our people to a different religion, there is wisdom in letting them live in peace and harmony within Kozhikode along with patronizing the unique religious works they produce."

 revenge_against_the_zamorin_of_calicut_desc: "Our rivarly against the Samoothiri of Kozhikode is something that has lasted ages now. Time and time again they come against the people of Kochin looking to subjugate them and the Raja of the land, but we must turn back these incursions whenever they approach! Revenge is what will be had by our people for the wounds they have inflicted upon us and we will be triumphant!"
 head_of_all_temples: "The Head of All Temples"
 head_of_all_temples_desc: "The Maharaja of Kochin may also be called the Gangadhara Kovil Adhikaarikal (Head of all Temples). With the Maharaja being the one to lead Kochin politically and also be a large religious figure within Kochin, they must also be able to be flexible in when using this title as new arrivals from different religious begin to come to our land for long-term trading purposes and long-term settlements."
 memory_of_the_last_chera: "Memory of the Last Chera"
 memory_of_the_last_chera_desc: "One of our ancestors from the area of Perumpadappu was spouse of the sister of the last Chera king, Rama Varma Kulashekhara. Because of this connection to the last true Chera, our ancestors obtained rights to not only temples and certain festivals, but also the legitimacy that the Chera Dynasty imposed upon its descendants. It would be wise of us to use this lineage to our advantage later on, should people question how legitimate our authority is."
 matrilineal_succession_in_the_royal_family: "Matrilinial Succession in the Royal Family"
 matrilineal_succession_in_the_royal_family_desc: "The royal family of Kochin practices a matrilineal form of succession and it often helps bring about a stable and relatively easy line of succession. Though some troublesome people appear in the dynastic lineage, there is no shortage of heirs in this system that dates back centuries."
 rekindle_far_off_diplomacy: "Rekindly Far Off Diplomacy"
 rekindle_far_off_diplomacy_desc: "When our rivals from Kozhikode tried to subjugate us, the people from far off lands in the east (this being the Ming Dynasty) attempted to mediate and thankfully sided with us instead of our devious rival. Though that connection to the eastern power is long gone and that fateful admiral who helped us is no longer around, we have the ambition and skill to rekindle this diplomacy from afar. Perhaps it won't just reach that old eastern power, but perhaps other places as well."

 cultivate_the_port_at_vypin_desc: "The island of Puthuvippu (Vypin) was created by a major flood in about 1341, but this flood did not bring with it pure destruction. This key island has now become a hub for our trade network and if we continue to cultivate it further, it can become a serious power in South Indian trade markets, perhaps even rivaling some of the other ports that have been prominent in the past."
 succeed_the_cheras: "Succeed the Cheras"
 succeed_the_cheras_desc: "Though some have easily forgotten the memory of the Chera Dynasty, Kerala is a place where their memory lives on without any sign of rest. Who is destined to succeed where they left off is unknown, but there is the ambition and the will within the Kochin people that is not present in the others to reunite the lands of the Chera Dynasty and once again bring glory and greatness back to the land they once held."

 ties_to_vijayanagar_desc: "We are inherently tied to the once giant power of Southern India, the Vijayanaga Empire. They bestowed upon us prestige and honor before, as well as materials and resources to begin our foundation; if we build upon this and also cultivate our inherent dynastic ties to the old empire, then we can have ourselves be viewed as a more legitimate dynasty amongst our own people whom they themselves remember the old empire well."

 contention_with_the_madurai_nayaks_desc: "Madurai has always been a troubling place to us. Conflicts between us and them have raged on the fields of Southern India for a while now and through them we have refined how our infantry fight in situations of both tropical and arid nature."

 patronize_srirangam_temple_and_others_desc: "The Srirangam Temple is perhaps one of the most stunning and awe-inspiring temples in our land, being a hub for Sri Vaishnavism and several other Hindus following other branches of Hinduism. Continued patronage of this central temple as well as the others of our land will undoubtedly garner us great praise, but also strategic tax and construction benefits for the future."
 promote_irrigation_projects: "Promote Irrigation Projects"
 promote_irrigation_projects_desc: "Irrigation is perhaps one of the most key things in all of our land. It is foundational to agricultural life and is something few powers seem to focus on, but our rulers know just how important it is for the growth and well-being of a society. If we subsidize and contribute to irrigation projects around the lands of Thanjavur, we will undoubtedly see better results with land development and land reclamation."
 scholarly_work_in_multiple_languages: "Scholarly Work in Many Languages"
 scholarly_work_in_multiple_languages_desc: "We are not only patrons of temples around our own land, but we are also patrons of knowledge. Books and manuscripts in the languages of Thanjavur such as Sanskrit, Kannada, and Telugu are of great interest to us and also to our wider population and we should not deny the gift of knowledge to anyone in our domain. Let us continue this well-meaning patronage for the greater prosperity of Thanjavur."

 promote_an_educated_court_desc: "Just as we seek to educate the people of our land, so to do we seek to educate the people of our court.

 overcome_corruption_and_dissent_desc: "Though changes to the court of Thanjavur are not uncommon, with these changes come the possibility of corruption and unrest within the administrative body.

Even though times may be different, we still can implement what we learned from them and try to emulate certain parts of them, such as having an army as large as they once did. It may be a long way off, but we can at least strive for such a goal."
 build_up_gingee_fort: "Build up Gingee Fort"
 build_up_gingee_fort_desc: "The fortress that is at the heart of our land is simply named: Gingee Fort. Simplistic in name, but unique in construction and layout, it serves as a model to build off of that is both uniquely defensive and self-sustaining.

 emulating_the_fortifications_of_gingee: "Emulating Fortress Designs"
 emulating_the_fortifications_of_gingee_desc: "The design of Gingee Fort is tough to replicate in its entirety, but our engineers are having an easier time changing it slightly to fit the various terrains present within our domain.

 conflicts_against_muslims: "Conflicts with Muslims"
 conflicts_against_muslims_desc: "It isn't hard to see that the Muslim invasions southward have caused great sorrows throughout Central and Southern India. Few remain who do not remember the times they came through and pillaged the land for whatever resources there were, and it was through these conflicts that our militaristic side grew. Even today we face these threats still, and even today we continue to fight back without backing down."
 expand_gingees_trade_sector: "Expand the Trade Sector"
 expand_gingees_trade_sector_desc: "Trade is increasingly becoming the life-blood of several states in Southern India. Taxation has its benefits, but the waters around Southern India are highly valuable and worth so much more than simple taxation at times, so who are we to just sit around and let that trade revenue sit on its own? We are going to actively promote and invest in the Gingee trade sector, that is what we'll do! Just as our neighbors are doing for themselves!"
 influencing_neighboring_politics: "Influence Neighboring Politics"
 influencing_neighboring_politics_desc: "The surrounding states of Gingee are full of local politics and we do understand this, but influence leaks into others states, whether it is ours into theirs or vice versa. Perhaps we can capitalize on this simple notion and bolster our own influence in our neighbors through diplomatic means, both legitimate and under-the-table."
 far_off_relations: "Far Away Relations"
 far_off_relations_desc: "The trade routes and politics of our neighbors has naturally led us to meeting far off states that are unlike Gingee in the slightest. They may follow different religions, have different customs, and fight in a completely different manner, but that doesn't mean we can't try to have good tidings with them at first and later on. From first impressions to long-term diplomatic relationships, Gingee must be an expert in diplomatic matters at all times."

 techniques_of_vijayangar: "Techniques of the Vijayanagara Empire"
 techniques_of_vijayangar_desc: "Though they are unjust at times, we cannot deny the fact that the Vijayanagara Empire has had its benefits for us of Keladi. Administration is easier and more efficient largely in part due to the fact that our overlords showed us the proper way to run things. We would be foolish to throw these lessons away and to start from scratch."

 expanding_the_keladi_domain_desc: "As the fields around us open up for potential, so to must we open up our military strength to take this land for ourselves.

 temple_patronage_and_constructions_desc: "To patronize and help out temples throughout Keladi is something that is natural for our rulers and as such should be continued throughout time.

 tolerance_of_other_faiths_desc: "Whether they are other Hindus following different Hindu traditions, or people of a different faith altogether, we do not punish them for the fact within Keladi lands.

 reform_agricultural_and_taxation_methods: "Reform Agricultural and Taxation Methods"
 reform_agricultural_and_taxation_methods_desc: "An age old practice it is, in a sense, but it is always needed: land reform. Keladi is no different in this sense, with us needing to reform how land is distributed and tilled and taxed. Putting in the proper time and effort to ensure a new and effective system of agricultural distribution and taxation amongs the populace will ensure that Keladi can prosper from the ground up, instead of only at certain levels."

 adaptation_of_firearms_desc: "With the introduction of firearms all around states in India, it is no new fact that the soldiers of Carnatic are already experimenting with how they can be used and improved for later on. If we fully implement firearms into our armies and integrate them into the officer part of our military thoroughly, there will be few out there who can match our firepower and discipline with them."
 fortifications_of_arcot: "Fortifications of Arcot"
 fortifications_of_arcot_desc: "For a long time, Arcot at the heart of our nation has been a sight of great fortifications. They have been compounded upon over the decades, and still prove effective in preparing the defenders of Carnatic for whatever may come for them.

 unity_with_religious_communities_desc: "Those of various religions are scattered throughout Carnatic, but they are not without a voice.

 capitalize_on_our_importance: "Capitalize on our Importance"
 capitalize_on_our_importance_desc: "To say the Maldives is important is putting it lightly. We are a key stopping point for several trade routes and for good reasons. If we can capitalize on this fact and ensure that trade in the Maldives is safe and prosperous, more and more people will come to us to conduct mercantile agreements and trade overall. We can become a true economic powerhouse if we just learn how to utilize our position well."

True to our nature as an economic and trading giant in the Indian Ocean, we will make sure that the export of these fine goods is not hindered in the slightest, but rather increased as time goes on so that the Maldives can continue it's overall dominance."

 semi_nomadic_traditions_desc: "The lands around us necessitated that we use both agricultural and nomadic ways of life in conjunction with each other.

 flexible_bands_for_blackfoot_society_desc: "The bands of Blackfoot society are highly decentralized in that, they may vary in size greatly (80 - 240 people).

That is why we value the warriors of our land and the socieites within our own that train young men to become strong fighters for the Blackfoot.

One of the most notable of these has been from Teotihuacan, a city to our east that flourished some ages ago but has sense faded away. The influences from the city, however, lasted in our people, especially in our building methods and culture, both of which have flourished since the loss of Teotihuacan."
 toltec_memories: "Toltec Memories"
 toltec_memories_desc: "The Toltec Empire was perhaps one of the greatest forces we have ever seen in the region. Its influence spread across vast swaths of land, including ours to a degree, and though their empire may be gone from the maps of today, their memories still ring true in our people and court today. Influential families of Toltec descent are still around and if we cultivate our court properly, we can attract these families in due to time to serve at our court."
 salt_fields_of_tzacoalco: "The Salt Fields of Tzacoalco"
 salt_fields_of_tzacoalco_desc: "The salt from these fields are quite valuable to many people. It helps preserve food and adds flavor to almost any kind of cuisine, thus making it a valuable commodity. It would be in the best interest of the people of Colima if we refined our production methods and increased our output over time so that we incur more value over time."
 defending_against_the_purepechas: "Defending against the Purepechas"
 defending_against_the_purepechas_desc: "Rivals? Enemies? One in the same. The Purepechas to our east have long been ones to try to cut down the Colima state from its position, but we stand against them at all times. We must concentrate on how to defend and route their raiding attempts and vicious attacks so that we can properly develop and prepare an offensive strategy of our own as time goes on."
 chichimeca_guamar_threats: "The Threats from the North"
 chichimeca_guamar_threats_desc: "The wild ones to our north, the Chichamecans and Guamar, are undoubtedly threats to Colima and its people. The ancestors of those wild fiends are what brought down the great Toltec Empire and it is from that example that we must learn. Fielding a larger and more effective military is perhaps the most obvious and most effective solution that our people are resorting to and it is something that we should actively endorse to stave off not only these threats, but perhaps others as well."
 usage_of_obsidian: "Usage of Obsidian"
 usage_of_obsidian_desc: "Obsidian has long been in use by our people; generations upon generations have used it for both civilian and militaristic purposes. The tools developed with obsidian parts seem to work well and as a result, we are having an easier time developing the land to our liking."
 state_for_the_tecos_people: "A State for the Tecos People"
 state_for_the_tecos_people_desc: "The Tecos have previously not been united in every sense. Divides in communities would bubble up into being full-on feuds that would cause chaos in our lands, but we are transcending those times now. We must utilize what we have and what we have and will learn to cultivate a state for the Tecos people, for, if we do not, we may be lost to the sands of time like so many of our ancestral states have been."

 TLA_ideas_bonus: "Tlapanec Ambition"
 nagualism_in_our_religion: "Nagualism"
 nagualism_in_our_religion_desc: "Being an integral part of our religion, nagualism comes down to a baby being born with an ability to shapeshift beyond the normal human form and into an animal form of some sort. This can either be helpful or harmful to our society, depending on how our religious traditions develop, but we will do our best to steer them into a direction of tolerance and acceptance, with nagualism being integral to that acceptance."
 taking_in_surrounding_cultures: "Surrounding Cultural Influences"
 taking_in_surrounding_cultures_desc: "We have taken in influence from other cultures around, like the Maya, Mixtecs, Zapotecs, and Purepechas, leading us to be a sort of multi-cultural society that fuses several other elements into the central Tlapanec culture. It would be wise of us to reach out and accept those other cultures that once contributed to our own so that a more peaceful exchange of traditions and customs may take place in the future, rather than having cultural isolation take place."
 cultivation_of_cotton_garments: "Cotton Garments"
 cultivation_of_cotton_garments_desc: "They may be fanciful to some and useless to others, but we know just how useful they can be. From stopping arrows to stopping the blades of obsidian weapons, the armor we fashion from cotton is becoming more and more useful for the Tlapanec warriors, and bolstering production of cotton will help out our production revenue as well as stockpiles of cotton for later use."
 fighting_the_aztecs: "Fighting the Aztecs"
 fighting_the_aztecs_desc: "Time and time again the Aztec people invade our land for tribute and land. Though we drive them out time after time, they encroach further into our domain with each push. It is time we learn to fight them on equal terms and drill our warriors as they do, promoting warrios of merit and skill rather than warriors of noble blood alone. They will not stand to invade use anymore; we will resist the Aztecs."
 cultivate_larger_dominions: "Cultivate Larger Dominions"
 cultivate_larger_dominions_desc: "There are barely any large cities in our area; only villages to small towns of people, but still we maintain control over them with some ease. It would be in the best interest of the Tlapanec people if these villages and towns grew in size to become more powerful and prosperous cities, capable of giving us viable warriors and workers for all parts of society."
 taking_what_is_rightfully_tlapanec: "What is Rightfully Tlapanec"
 taking_what_is_rightfully_tlapanec_desc: "Tlapanec land is rugged and harsh, but not hopeless. There have been slow efforts to cultivate the land further beyond what it currently is, but the jungle and weather constantly hamper our endeavors to do so. If we can concentrate our workforce and advance our tool quality, perhaps we can make faster progress for all of the Tlapanec people."
 an_integrated_tlapanec_state: "An Integrated Tlapanec State"
 an_integrated_tlapanec_state_desc: "After growing and becoming what we are now, it's only right that we attempt to centralize authority and focus on internal matters so that our people are prosperous and not suffering from inabilities on our part. Educational measures are what is next for us, integrating educational reforms and places of learning all around the Tlapanec realm so that the commoner may learn what was once only available to the noble class."

 three_hearts_three_cities: "Taijin, Cempoala, and Teayo"
 three_hearts_three_cities_desc: "Some call them our three hearts, but in reality they are our three key cities. Cempoala (the place of twenty waters) was the nominal ruler of the Totonacapan Kingdom; Teayo (tortoise atop stone) is the place where we see a mix of various cultures such as Toltax, Mexica, and Huastec; and Taijin is perhaps our greatest city, being inhabited for countless generations (until being burned down in a fire in the 1200's) and being situated along key trade routes along with preserving leftovers from the ancient city of Teotihuacan. With all the successor to Taijin along with the other two cities working together in harmony, we will be able to plan and develop Totonac culture and society further than we've ever thought possible."
 perfection_of_ceramics_sculpting_architecture: "Perfecting our Crafts"
 perfection_of_ceramics_sculpting_architecture_desc: "We are known for our craft work in pottery, ceramins, sculptures, and architecture. There are several who marvel at the works of our cities and people and if we continue to steadily increase our production of said works and continue developing our unique styles, there is no doubt that the Totonacs will be a truly prestigious trading power in the region."
 ceremonial_centers: "Ceremonial Centers"
 ceremonial_centers_desc: "We have several centers where ceremonies, both religious and cultural, take place. The upkeep of them is tough at times, but the effort is well worth it due to the strengthening of our faith through them. Building more and refining our traditions done at these centers will do not only the commoners good, but our priestly class and noble class as well; we just simply need to ease them into these upcoming reforms."
 non_human_sacrifices: "Non-Human Sacrifices"
 non_human_sacrifices_desc: "Contrary to those around us such as the Aztecs, we do not practice human sacrifice... All the time. Our goddess of maize deemed such sacrifices unworthy and not needed, so instead we give herbs, flowers, and animal sacrifices instead. Such people who might normally be used for human sacrifices can instead be put to work in Totonac society instead, developing the land that is uncultivated... And if they disobey, the god of the sun will have them and their hearts."
 preserving_totonac_culture: "Preserving Totonac Culture"
 preserving_totonac_culture_desc: "There are several who would see Totonac culture be absorbed into their own and these influences are spreading throughout Totonac society. We must begin to build and keep a unique cultural identity compared to those around us and make our court distinctivly Totonac, rather than perhaps Aztec, Huastec, or Zapotec. It will take some time, but our court will become the bastion and beacon of Totonac culture, long enough for others to sprout up elsewhere."
 against_the_aztecs: "Against the Aztecs"
 against_the_aztecs_desc: "That triple alliance to the west of us... It threatens our very way of life. Totonac warriors, priests, and commoners alike know the threat the Aztecs are when they are united and this alliance that has formed is nothing short of a ticking threat waiting to exterminate the Totonac people. We need to harden ourselves and prepare our warriors for a fearless campaign against them and any who would support them, and even when the Aztecs are defeated, we must still ready ourselves for what other threats to the Totonacs there may be."
 rebuilding_taijin: "Rebuilding Taijin"
 rebuilding_taijin_desc: "Burned down in a fire so long ago, but still within our memory. Taijin must not ever be forgotten and its place must be kept sacred within the hearts of the Totonac people. Rebuilding it will be a large undertaking, but completing it will assure us the loyalty and unity of the Totonac people altogether. Let us go forth and trace our steps back to our foundation, and mend the cracks that are there, freeing Totonac society to be whole once again."

 speakers_of_four_languages_desc: "Those of our homeland in the Toluca Valley speak four main languages: Otomi, Matlatzinca, Mazahua, and Nahuatl. Such diversity in how our people speak allows easier connections to be made with neighboring states, and if we incorporate more languages as we go on, we can be even more appealing to neighboring states later on."
 memories_of_the_tepanec_empire: "Memories of the Tepanec Empire"
 memories_of_the_tepanec_empire_desc: "In ages past, we were the subjects of the Tepanec Empire. They may not have lasted long, but the system of master-to-subject that they enforced was good groundwork for us to build off of. If we continue to cultivate it and reform it as time goes on, we can ensure a friendly and good relationship with our future subjects."
 fending_off_purepechas_and_aztecs: "Fending off Foes"
 fending_off_purepechas_and_aztecs_desc: "From two sides we are threatened: the Purepechas and the Aztecs. They both seek our land and people, but we would rather not be subjects to either if we can help it. We must resist them and strive to maintain our independent status; there must be a true state for the Matlatzinca people, not a petty subject state that is abused by overlords."
 fortify_toluca_valley_and_possessions: "Fortify Toluca Valley"
 fortify_toluca_valley_and_possessions_desc: "Toluca Valley is our home and has been for centuries now. The valley in it is clear for all to see and as such there are many who want it under their control. We must, as a result, fortify it and barricade it from invasions so as to ensure the prosperity and safety of the Matlatzinca people."
 tight_administrative_structure: "Tight Administrative Structure"
 tight_administrative_structure_desc: "Through the nature of how the Matlatzinca people live in the Toluca Valley, the administrative structure has to be close-knit and centralized. This may be strange to outsiders, but for us, it is natural and needed. A decentralized system will simply lead to the breakup of all Matlatzinca cities and what power they hold."
 develop_matlatzinco: "Develop Matlatzinco"
 develop_matlatzinco_desc: "Our core city, Matlatzinco, may not be as big as other cities around us, but it is what we call our capital and what we shall develop into a grand place for the Matlatzinca people. From here, we shall enjoy greatness and prosperity."
 city_states_to_nationhood: "Toward being a Nation"
 city_states_to_nationhood_desc: "Matlatzinca people may not seem like they are ready to become a fully fledged nation to some, but the people themselves know differently.

 shadow_of_the_aztecs: "In the Shadow of the Aztecs"
 shadow_of_the_aztecs_desc: "The core of the Aztecs is found in Tenochtitlan and the Triple Alliance that was formed between it, Texcoco, and Talcopan. The influence from those three cities stretches far and wide, even to the lands of Coixtlahuaca, thus making us in their shadow partially. It is not all dark for us, however, as we can and have been learning from them for sevreal decades now. Let us put this knowledge into practice and unite our people beyond their previous ties, like the Aztecs in the north have."
 multi_ethnic_polity_of_mesoamerica: "Multiple Cultures"
 multi_ethnic_polity_of_mesoamerica_desc: "There are two prominent cultures found within Coixtlahuaca: the Choncho and the Mixtec. Gradually this will change and we will grow to encompass more cultures within the borders of our state and when we do, we must be accepting of them as we have been with the Choncho and Mixtec so far. Cultural cooperation is not simply good for us, it is needed if we wish to survive to become larger and stronger."
 plain_of_snakes: "'Plain of Snakes'"
 plain_of_snakes_desc: "Our name translates to 'plain of snakes' and whilst to some this might be ambiguous, it is quite obvious to us: the land is rife with snakes! Harmful ones at that! Whilst not every part of our land is snake-filled, we can at least use the naturally harsh landscape to our advantage, cultivating natural defensive barriers against invaders (some of which may include snakes)."
 aztec_attributes: "Aztec Attributes"
 aztec_attributes_desc: "We have inherited various traits and traditions from the Aztecs over the decades and with them have come ceremonial customs that have become integrated with our own. Part of them emphasize hierarchy in society and the positions of 'Cuauhtlatoani', 'Tlatoani', and 'Huehuetlatoani', amongst others. By keeping certain legitimizing rituals together and within Coixtlahuaca, we can keep our royal family and leader in power with the utmost loyalty from our people."
 mixtec_connections: "Mixtec Connections"
 mixtec_connections_desc: "The Mixtec are known for their stone crafts as well as architectual style and are also integral to Coixtlahuaca. If we can utilize their craft work for our own projects, we'll see better and more refined buildings rise up in our land, as well as ones that are just nicer to look at in general."
 nahuatl_language_prominence: "The Nahuatl Language"
 nahuatl_language_prominence_desc: "The main language within our court is Nahuatl and its the same for several courts near to Coixtlahuaca, as it should be. As time goes on, we will promote and refine the language as we see fit to help our efforts in both our administration, military, and diplomatic sector. It'll be a unifying force within Coixtlahuaca."

 blending_together_into_coixtlahuaca_desc: "There will be some who doubt just how effectively we can integrate different cultures and people into our state, and to those who doubt us, we say, 'watch, and learn'. Our efforts will be refined, our programs will be rigid and flexible whenever and wherever needed, and integration will be the main and key facet of our state."

Let others around us know this, and let them know that our status beneath the gods is holier than theirs; none shall be above us in this regard."
 makers_of_dyes: "Makers of Dyes"
 makers_of_dyes_desc: "Traditionally we produce good quantities of dyes for ourselves and surrounding places. It is a rather rare commodity and as such it's valued throughout several places around us; bolstering and spreading its production out will only serve to increase the sale of these dyes that we produce, and we will profit from this in time."

 at_the_foot_of_the_mountain_desc: "In Zapotec, our name is Xaguixe, meaning 'at the foot of the mountain'.

Building upon it and making more intricate and sturdier fortifications will allow us to fend off any incoming invasions or intrusions into our domain."
 celestial_constellation: "'Celestial Constellation'"
 celestial_constellation_desc: "Our original name, 'Xaquija' means 'celestial constellation' and with it, a god came from the heavens in the form of a bird, accompanied by a constellation of stars and founded a temple here. From here, and with the mythical foundation of the large stone split in half with the name of the Stone of the Sun, we claim even greater religious authority, but this time branching into the Zapotec area of things. Even with this, the Zapotec and Aztec mytholigies are becoming interconnected as time goes on and as such, our religious authority is becoming even stronger, stronger than any of those around us."
 aztec_fighting_spirit: "Aztec Fighting Spirit"
 aztec_fighting_spirit_desc: "The Aztecs did not impart merely religious traditions upon us, but also military traditions. The fighting spirit and warrior ranks of their society is something that we need and promote greatly, and with them in mind, our warriors will become more capable in battle."

 zapotec_influences_desc: "The Zapotec people are widespread in our communities, similar to the Aztecs.

 nahuatl_bastion_desc: "The Nahuatl pantheon and language, and even the great Nahua culture must be kept alive and sacred.

 remember_eight_dear_jaguar_claw_desc: "He was the very first Mixtec ruler to ever unify the disparate Mixtec city-states, and under him, the Mixtecs thrived like never before. We must claim the legitimacy that he put forth and never let it go, for, in order to survive in the region we live in, we must be united in our efforts from the ground up."
 three_traditional_mixtec_groups: "Three Traditional Mixtec Groups"
 three_traditional_mixtec_groups_desc: "The three groups within Mixtec society that divide the us into a sort of societal hierarchy has been around for several generations now and it has served us well in keeping things in order, despite our spread out communities.

 foremost_goldsmiths: "Foremost Goldsmiths"
 foremost_goldsmiths_desc: "People from all around the region know just who to go to if they want work in gold done, and done right: the Mixtecs.

 resistant_mixtec_city_states_desc: "The Mixtec people are necessarily united on all matters. There is an extensive history of division between the various city-states that are inhabited by Mixtecs, but this division does not mean lack of resistance. Indeed several are able to take up arms against invaders and it is this military tradition from the past that we remember well from them."

 reform_the_mixtec_codices_desc: "For so many years now, the codices we've crafted have been used by several different people groups for various different things, from educational to cultural purposes. In time, however, we will need to refine how we make and craft them as they are sometimes disorganized and without a clear direction in them. By refining them, we can better spread education and ideas throughout Mixtec society."

 mastery_of_jewelery_and_mosaic_crafting_desc: "Not only are we famous as goldsmiths, but our mastery of jewelry and mosaic pieces is also well known throughout the regions.

The disparate city-states can once again come together and form a unified polity and we can secure a strong, centralized administration in time, and when we do, we will be able to put forth a military capable of rivaling any other power around us.

 ahuacatlan_lordship_desc: "Though the kingdom they established was not memorable to some, we of Xalisco remember it fondly.

 present_and_incoming_religious_traditions_desc: "Xalisco is home to a myriad of religious traditions, stretching from centuries ago to from neighboring areas and regions.

But the place where the sand and eye meet, it does not obscure vision, it only emboldens the resolve of its people and makes them more willing to stand for what they believe in.

 learning_from_tribute_payments_desc: "Routinely we have been subjected to the authority of various surrounding powers, namely the Aztecs.

Our interest lies in formalizing their structure and position inside our realm so that they do not grow too powerful nor do they feel disenfranchised; it's a tough balancing act, but it's one we must commit to if we are to be successful in this world."
 malvi_authorities: "Malvi Authorities"
 malvi_authorities_desc: "The authority from the Sultanate of Malwa is overbearing at times, but it does bring with it benefits that we would not otherwise get to see. One of these benefits is the introduction of firearms to the state of Garha, and in seeing how useful they've been for the Malvi people, using it for ourselves could make things all the more easier when fighting other powers around. Perhaps, in time, we could even turn these firearms on those who introduced us to them."
 consolidate_the_lands_of_gondwana: "Consolidate Gondwana"
 consolidate_the_lands_of_gondwana_desc: "Our central focus is on the region known as Gondwana, home of the Gondi people. Garha, as well as other polities, have strived to unite this region isn't very well defined as the spread of the Gond people is so far reaching, but we can say for sure that Central India is key to Gondwana itself, and if we can obtain and maintain control over it, we will be able to work with cohesively with our fellow Gonds to develop the Gondwana into a thing of beauty."

 rajput_caste_heritage_desc: "Back before the times of Bahmanis and during the times of when the Delhi Sultanate was a grand force on the subcontinent, Khandesh was ruled by the Chauhans, who claim kinship with the Rajput people. The military prowess found within the Rajputs was also found within the Chauhans and we benefit from this still, taking up the warrior tradition and military fighting heritage imbued within the people of our land."
 rebels_against_bahmanis: "Rebels Against Bahmanis"
 rebels_against_bahmanis_desc: "Our foundation as a seperate entity in the region comes from when the governor of Daulatabad, Bahram Khan Mazindarani, rose up against the Bahmani ruler along with Malik Raja and powers from Berar and Baglana. Though the rebellion failed, it set in motion what would allow Malik Raja to separate Khandesh away from Bahmanis and other powers into a completely independent state, and, though this would change inevitably later on, it helped set a precedent for our people in the future."
 land_of_the_khans: "'Land of the Khans'"
 land_of_the_khans_desc: "Known as the 'land of the khans', there will need to be a land to match the power and ferocity of the previous great khans we know from stories and books. Khandesh may not be the most likely state to succeed where other khans and khan-like figures have failed, but we can always strive for it and part of that includes building up a strong and formidable military force."
 from_caliph_umar_al_faruq: "Lineage to Caliph Umar"
 from_caliph_umar_al_faruq_desc: "Malik Raja claimed his lineage dating back to Caliph Umar from the Rashidun Caliphate. Such a bold and grand claim will be hard to maintain at times, but we are intent on making it be seen as legitimate and true, for we can indeed be the successors to the caliphate and emulate Caliph Umar and project the strength that he once did during the times of old."
 rivals_of_gujarat: "Rivals of Gujarat"
 rivals_of_gujarat_desc: "The rulers of Gujarat have put us under their authority time and time again, seeing our land as valuable for only themselves. We have tried to break away at various points, but still the Gujarat power wielded to our west is strong. We must strike when they are weak, take up arms and march forth when we are at our peak, and seek out victory against those who once subjugated us, and those in the future who would see the Khandeshi people subdued!"
 fortify_the_holdings_of_khandesh: "Fortify Khandeshi Holdings"
 fortify_the_holdings_of_khandesh_desc: "Fortifications in our land are routinely being challenged by new siege tactics and weaponry, necessitating better defensive measures and a more efficient way of running the garrisons within. By continually compounding upon our succesful renovations from before, the fortifications we hold close to us will serve as great barriers to the enemies of Khandesh."
 satiate_the_minorities: "Satiate the Minorities"
 satiate_the_minorities_desc: "Like many other sultanates before Khandesh, the minorities of Hindustan are plentiful, seeking both recognition and local power when they are conquered (that is, if they do not revolt or have their revolts suppressed). Being as traditional sultanates are, we seek to work with and accept these minority groups rather than to alienate them, thus bringing Khandesh into a greater state of ease and promoting better social cohesion."

 what_may_have_been_vijayapura_and_po_ni_desc: "The history from before we became part of the wider Muslim world is murky and unclear, but we do have some indication that there were states existing before us, such as Vijayapura and Po-ni. These smaller states were subjects of at times Srivijaya, Chinese powers, or Majapahit, but all contributed to the culmination of a greater Bruneian identity as time went on. Even today, we still feel the effects of these past states in our own court, and for this influence we are thankful."

Both were once great giants on the stage of the Nusantara Archipelago and have since declined greatly from their golden ages, but their influence on us is unmistakable. We will incorporate what we have learned from both powers into our own state and we can surely be the next great empire of these wondrous islands of culture, religion, and trade."

 chinese_influences_desc: "The Chinese, dating all the way back to the Song Dynasty, have had great amounts of influence in their own waters to the north, but also to the waters in the south, where we call home. Our submission to them as a tributary status some time ago helped influence part of culture, and even though we no longer pay tribute to the Chinese, we still do earn ourselves a good name with powers around us from this healthy relationship we've cultivated with them."
 trading_in_nusantara: "Trading amongst the Islands"
 trading_in_nusantara_desc: "The various islands of Nusantara are rich in both culture and religion, but also in resources to cultivate. The resources cultivated and traded off are the life-blood of empires and kingdoms and sultanates in the archipelago and we are no exception. It would be in our best interest to partake in this trading tradition and invest time and effort into making sure trade goes in our favor, as opposed to our rivals."
 promote_thalassocratic_control: "Promote Thalassocratic Control"
 promote_thalassocratic_control_desc: "The nature of our region of islands is such that, mere land armies are not enough. Naval superiority is absolutely key to ensuring dominance in both peaceful times and times of war and we of Brunei know this all too well. It is our duty, then, to ensure ourselves a large and great navy to promote our own control over these water ways, and to disallow our rivals from gaining the high ground on this matter."
 cross_island_empire: "Multi-Island Empire"
 cross_island_empire_desc: "Like those before us, we reach out and touch several islands with our power in order to properly assert control over the territories inherently valuable to Nusantara. It won't be easy to do, but the Bruneian administration is ready to enforce laws and regulations in more localized areas that our nation reaches out toward; when all is said and done, unification will be a reality we can achieve, and one that Brunei will attain for itself."

That is our the coming golden age for our people, and not only is it a glorious sight to behold when it arrives, but it will be a milestone for us where upon we expand further than ever and set our ambitions beyond our home island of Borneo and those others nearby. The world is vast and in need of authority that can make the land and people profitable and prosperous, and it is those of Brunei who know how to make this happen."

Beware the harsh north..."

 revitalize_the_legacy_of_the_althing_desc: "There vestiges of the althing in Iceland still, what with it being established in the early 900s and continuing on from there and then going into a decline once Christianity was introduced into Iceland. Still, it is an important part of Icelandic history and one of the oldest parliaments in the world; using its legacy and perhaps even revitalizing it in the coming years could bring legitimacy and stability to the land once more."
 geographic_isolation_and_opportunism: "Geographic Isolation and Opportunism"
 geographic_isolation_and_opportunism_desc: "Isolation is something very familiar to Icelanders. But, what our ancestors knew that some people today forget is that Iceland is close to the lands of what is called Greenland, and our old sagas do tell of our ancestors travelling to here and beyond. We can use our isolation in geography, then, as an advantage and begin efforts to expand our domain outward through colonization efforts that are more organized and more effective than the ones our ancestors put forth."
 promote_icelandic_fishing_and_trade: "Promote Icelandic Commerce"
 promote_icelandic_fishing_and_trade_desc: "Yes, commerce from Iceland is remote and hard to reach, but it is worth the travel for some people, such as those from Ireland, Scotland, Norway, and other northern-oriented nations. If we can entice more consumers to come north and engage with the Icelandic merchants more than in previous ages, then we will see profits over time (along with more visitors... It gets lonely here in Iceland)."

 effects_of_the_reformation_desc: "Europe has apparently been home to religious strife of a different kind that is unfamiliar to the people of Iceland. These so called Protestants and Reformed folks are springing up all over Europe and, well, Icelanders are curious as to what will come of themselves now that they too are feeling the effects of the Reformation. Whatever path is chosen for Iceland, the notion of serving the people and promoting stability no matter what will be our primary goal."
 use_our_naval_legacy: "Our Naval Legacy"
 use_our_naval_legacy_desc: "What we lack in terms of a formal army we make up for in the form of a fearsome navy. By continuing to build it up and refine our naval practices, there will be few who can put up a genuine fight against our naval dominance. After the waters are secure, we can then focus on our efforts on land."

 norse_resurgence_desc: "The Norse may have changed a lot since the days of the Vikings and their dominance over the northern shores and waters, but those of Iceland can still recall their memories clearly compared to the likes of Norway, Denmark, or Sweden. With this legacy, the Norse will rise again as they expand out, they will once more engage in bloody wars of raiding and conquest.

 former_fuedatory_of_delhi: "Former Feudatory of Delhi"
 former_fuedatory_of_delhi_desc: "The memories of when we were a feuadtory underneath the likes of the Delhi Sultanate are not forgotten in the slightest; much of our administration is still somewhat based on what the sultanate introduced to our people, meaning we take after certain laws and measures from the ground up. One essential part that we have put work into integrating into Gwalior is the effective tax system they left behind, meaning we are able to obtain much higher revenues from the people of our land than other states around us."
 rebels_against_delhi: "Rebels Against Delhi"
 rebels_against_delhi_desc: "The earliest record of us rebelling against the likes of Delhi are in 1391-1392 under our leader of the time, Virasimha, but this was met with defeat by the general Islam Khan. Still, Virashimha was not executed and he worked tirelessly to undermine Delhi's efforts to integrate and keep hold of Gwalior, to which he obtained success some years later. As we well know, there are plenty of others who rebelled against the Delhi Sultanate, and many of those revolting nations would likely be our friends later on."
 jain_scholars_in_gwalior: "Jain Scholars"
 jain_scholars_in_gwalior_desc: "Virama, who ruled Gwalior from 1402-1423, had an immense amount of Jain scholars come through and set up residence inside of Gwalior and with them saw the rise in new ideas being spread about. If we continue to allow Jains into Gwalior and seek out a mutualistic relationship with them, the prosperity of the state could increase by so much more than we think."
 between_delhi_and_malwa: "Between Delhi and Malwa"
 between_delhi_and_malwa_desc: "With the decline of the Delhi Sultanate came other sultanates in its place, one of the most prominent ones being to our south: the Sultanate of Malwa. Both the remains of Delhi and Malwa to our south pose great threats to the likes of Gwalior and its people, so it would be beneficial to learn better military strategies from both powers when possible whilst also preparing for any invasion either power might try for."
 asylum_to_rebels_and_others: "Asylum to Dissidents"
 asylum_to_rebels_and_others_desc: "With the downfall of Delhi comes dissidents who wish to use there skills against their former overlord, or perhaps some other power in the region. Though many states will reject said dissidents, why should Gwalior? We revolted from Delhi, we should be a practical haven for these kinds of people! And we can make good use of them and obtain connections, both shady and formal, with powers around the subcontinent and perhaps even beyond."
 improving_defensive_measures: "Improving Defenses in Gwalior"
 improving_defensive_measures_desc: "The central fortress, Gwalior Fort, is key to our power, certainly, but there is more to us than that central fort. With a defensive mentality in mind, we must prepare a more stringent and effective defense in our homeland so that any invaders will suffer even more when coming through. Partisan attacks, strange explosives buried in the ground that explode with enough pressure, and traps at various points, all can be employed by Gwalior to help thwart foreign invasions."
 rajput_diplomacy: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 rajput_diplomacy_desc: "Connections with the Rajput people are strong within Gwalior. We are not full Rajputs ourselves, but we have taken after several traditions and customs that the Rajputs themselves have, including around diplomacy. Though we have refined it over the years, this sort of Rajput diplomacy for the people of Gwalior is flexible and our policies are more fluid than in other states around us so that we can adapt to changing circumstances, whatever they may be."

 rao_underneath_the_sisodias_desc: "Our ruler, when underneath the leaders of Mewar, take on the title of Rao (a different form of Raja). With this in mind, we are designated more toward maintaining the lands that Mewar cannot govern themselves and thus must learn to field more military regiments in a more refined manner, thus keeping this land under lock-and-key and safely producing revenue."
 legacy_of_the_meena_tribe: "Legacy of the Meena Tribe"
 legacy_of_the_meena_tribe_desc: "Before the time of the Rajput invasion of this land, there was the Meena tribe who stayed here, claiming descent all the way back toward the Matsya Kingdom. Though most are gone from power now in Hadoti, some still remain as prominent members of Hadoti society and their legacy of having more respect for women than more traditional Hindu states is felt throughout all of Hadoti, especially in our own court."
 rajput_meena_intermingling: "Rajput-Meena Intermingling"
 rajput_meena_intermingling_desc: "The two groups may have fought each other to a bloody end in the previous centuries, but that time is over now. We must work on reconciling these differences within Hadoti itself and also work on enjoining these two populations into one cohesive unit that Hadoti can rely on, for, times of war and times of disaster do not discriminate based on tribal or clan membership, they take from and stike at anyone and everyone."

 handing_down_of_martial_traditions_desc: "Our connections with Mewar have been strong in the past, and as a result of this strong connection with them there has been a mutual exchange of knowledge between Hadoti and its overlord. The martial training and traditions from the Rajput heartland are plentiful and the military of Hadoti is ever thankful that they are included in the sharing these traditions."
 dynastic_support_from_mewar: "Dynastic Support"
 dynastic_support_from_mewar_desc: "When push came to shove in the past for Hadoti, the royals of Mewar could be relied on for backing up our claims or our side in a dispute. We can still use this leverage today or perhaps even rely on our own connections not in the royals of Mewar to bolster our own dynasty, especially on the international stage."
 cultivation_of_rajput_clans: "Cultivation of Rajput Clans"
 cultivation_of_rajput_clans_desc: "The plentiful clans of Rajput people are ready to serve Hadoti, they simply need to be organized and given strong leadership from us. Our own efforts to institute viable candidates for leadership are going well so far and the beneficial relationship between the Hadoti government and the clans is infact helping things progress, so we should expect the Rajput powerbase within us expand and be ready for future conflicts."
 taking_after_the_sisodias: "Taking after the Sisodias"
 taking_after_the_sisodias_desc: "The Sisodias of Mewar were unique in several ways, one of which was in how illustrious they were and how they tried to make themselves out to be above other Rajput clans through poetry and other art forms. Perhaps it is time that those of Hadoti do the same? We could separate ourselves from the other clans, rise above them, and promote the royalty of Hadoti as the grand and true leaders, above all others... It sounds nice, doesn't it?"

 rajput_and_malvi_influences_desc: "We are at the confluence of both Rajput communities and incoming Malvi influences from the east. Both hold great sway in Baglana and both at times create friction when they meet each other, but when combined properly, they create a militaristic nature that is unlike anything around us. Baglana can only benefit from such a combination of forces."
 the_fake_subject_state: "The Fake Subject"
 the_fake_subject_state_desc: "Previous invaders have come through our land and subjugated a few chiefs and simply thought that the entirety of Baglana was underneath them, but they were greatly mistaken. Tribute to be paid? Irregular at best. Troops to be levied? Maybe, maybe not. Baglana has always been a tenuous, or rather, fake subject state and it will continue to be so, inspiring our people to strive for freedom from these incursions against us."
 our_natural_terrain: "Our Natural Terrain"
 our_natural_terrain_desc: "The terrain of Baglana is not forgiving to those who are new to it. Mountains and valleys and fertile plains all scattered about in Baglana, and we know how to best use them in a defensive strategy as well as navigate them for troop movements. Others who might invade us know very little of these routes we take and as such we will take advantage of this."
 leagued_with_western_shore_pirates: "Pirates? With Baglana?"
 leagued_with_western_shore_pirates_desc: "With how scattered some of our cities and communities are, it should come as no surprise that those of Baglana have shady connections all around, especially with raiders and pirates. The western coast has been a haven for us in this regard and we are willing to make these contracts with pirates and raiders into something more formal so that all of Baglana can benefit."
 rein_in_the_chiefs_under_the_raja: "Rein in the Chiefs of Baglana"
 rein_in_the_chiefs_under_the_raja_desc: "The myriad of chiefs throughout Baglana are capable of causing issues at times with the central government, and the Raja is not always able to calm them down through peaceful means. There must be expeditions sent out to formally subjugate and bring these chiefs underneath the flag of Baglana so that they do not stir up trouble beneath the Raja or in the communities that are loyal to the Raja."
 rivals_in_khandesh: "Rivals in Khandesh"
 rivals_in_khandesh_desc: "Khandesh has been a staunch rival of ours for decades now, being one to launch attacks against us and the Gujarati people to our northwest. They think they can easily come through Baglana and tear down what we've worked on for so long, but they couldn't be more wrong. The people of Baglana are ready and willing to take up arms at every point against these invaders and Khandesh will be the first to know this."
 reshape_military_ranks_in_baglana: "Reshaping the Military of Baglana"
 reshape_military_ranks_in_baglana_desc: "By now we have noticed the faults in the army of Baglana, one of which is the fact that payment and service is not nearly as formal as it should be. If we can organize military matters into something centralized and cohesive, we'll benefit from a better quality army that can do more work than a simple levy-based army of irregularly trained soldiers."

 the_prices_of_being_on_the_border: "Being on the Border"
 the_prices_of_being_on_the_border_desc: "The border region in which we inhabit has been crossed by a great many people before the sultans of Multan came around. We are accustom to this occasional passing of people and have even been successful in garnering some of these people to settle in the lands of Multan. With an influx of population, they will be good to use as soldiers when Multan needs them since warfare is inherent to our position... After we integrate them into society, of course."
 great_center_of_trade: "Great Center of Trade"
 great_center_of_trade_desc: "Past travellers have written about Multan and what they write is nothing short of the truth: that Multan is a grand center of trade along the Indus River. We readily embrace this fact and try to stimulate trade as best we can so that our revenue streams can increase as time goes on."
 friends_of_the_baloch: "Friends of the Baloch"
 friends_of_the_baloch_desc: "Few talk of the people of the Baloch for some reason or another; perhaps it is because they are seen as tribal and unworthy? We don't know for sure, but what we do know is that our citizens have made great friends in the people of the Baloch and many mercenary contracts are coming through to Multan from the region because of this. Why not cement this friendship further and accept the mercenaries into our fold?"

 repulse_delhi_and_afghan_invasions_desc: "Pashtun and Hindustani troops alike are keen on taking over Multan at all times, whether by diplomacy or by conquest, neither of which we will readily allow happen.

They are no longer a frontier land that is simply on the edge of an empire or kingdom of some sort, no, they are now a heartland to a vibrant and prosperous people.

Such a long and strong line of succession makes Bishnupur ingrained in the people it rules over; the people have faith in the royal lineage and know it well enough to have a good amount of trust in the ones who have ruled over Mallabhum for so long."

 the_isolation_of_bishnupur_desc: "Our homeland is quite isolated from other communities and states and rarely do people come through our lands to invade or even trade.

 praying_to_bipodtarini_devi_desc: "Our kings are often associated with Bipodtarini Devi, who is considered one of the 108 avatars of the goddess Durga. She is closely linked with the concept of overcoming troubles and often prayed to for this, and thus as our kings are associated with this, they too should be looked up to in order to help overcome struggles, thus in part promoting the relation with Bipodtarini Devi."

 abiding_by_the_mallabda_calendar_desc: "We have developed a unique calendar in Bishnupur that is unlike most others (though somewhat related to other Bengali calendars).

By investing in these projects more over time, we can and will see our people prosper and our state expand steadily as it profits in the long-run from our hard work."
 reaching_out_for_trade_agreements: "Reaching out for Trade"
 reaching_out_for_trade_agreements_desc: "Like many before us, being on the coast of Africa means that we need to reach out across the open water to obtain friendship as well as profitable trade agreements. We're going to keep an open mind with whoever we meet as, money trumps all else, does it not? Well, maybe not all else, but certainly many things."
 naval_efforts_of_majeerteen: "Naval Efforts of Majeerteen"
 naval_efforts_of_majeerteen_desc: "We would not be a true Somali Sultanate if we did not bolster our naval force to some degree. The time has finally come to invest in our sailors and ships so that they do not falter when on the high seas when trading or when in combat against rival navies."
 centralized_authority_in_majeerteen: "Centralized Authority in Majeerteen"
 centralized_authority_in_majeerteen_desc: "By reforming the authority within Majeerteen over time and putting an emphasis on bureaucracy over tribal politics, we will see a less unrest within the sultanate as well as increased influence in local politics. We'd rather have ourselves influencing the people of Majeerteen as opposed to possible insurgents hidden within the local chiefs."
 establish_a_modern_sultanate: "Establish a Modern Sultanate"
 establish_a_modern_sultanate_desc: "With changing times comes changing technologies and ways of thought. It is not enough to follow Islamic law all the time and become hardline in our thinking; we must open up to new ways of thought that some scholars may put forth in both educational and religious settings."
 establish_the_majeerteen_military: "Establish the Majeerteen Military"
 establish_the_majeerteen_military_desc: "The military of Majeerteen has never been anything that stands out in comparison to other Somali states, but we know this cannot last. Naval warfare is important, but taking land that is away from the coast is also very important and a strong military will be needed for that. Let us take the first steps in establishing a centralized and cogent military force that Majeerteen can use for both offensive and defensive purposes."

 sufi_shrines_rebuilt_desc: "Nagaur has been the home to sufi shrines for many decades now, but several were destroyed in the 14th century to various invasions and conflicts.

 memory_of_the_mongol_invasions_desc: "Within the memory of Nagaur is that of the Mongol invasions and what they did to the political as well as military landscape of the subcontinent. We must not let the bad parts of what they did weigh us down, but rather we must embrace the tactics they used that were so effective at dismantling northern powers, chief among them were based around cavalry."
 alliances_against_mewar: "Alliances against Mewar"
 alliances_against_mewar_desc: "Mewar has been something of a thorn in our side, but also a beneficial power to Nagaur at other times. The Rajputs are not to be underestimated at all, but we must also remember that they too will want to take over us. Let us form an alliance network to effectively ensure the destruction of Mewar and after them, the others who will still try to threaten Nagaur."

 rajput_warriors_with_turks_desc: "Turkic Mongols that fought against us decades before along with Rajputs that fought us more recently are hardly without their uses.

 against_the_sayyids_of_delhi: "Against Delhi"
 against_the_sayyids_of_delhi_desc: "The rulers of Delhi have often sought to influence and take control over Nagaur in some way or form since we are partially of Islamic origin, but their efforts shall forever be in vain. Those Nagaur will triumph over Delhi, especially the Sayyids, whether by underhanded tactics or overt and factual claims on their land."
 fortify_naguar_fort_and_others: "Fortify Nagaur"
 fortify_naguar_fort_and_others_desc: "It is no secret that our land is need of defenses, but as to how and where we will build these defenses is another question. Perhaps if we can focus our efforts on defense a bit more we can ensure that those of Nagaur are safer and that the land we rest upon is made less vulnerable to the devastation caused by invading armies."

 enemies_in_the_huron_iroquois_desc: "Traditionals enemies as they may be, the Huron and Iroquois have a powerful influence on the lands around us. We must keep our knowledge of warfare we have engaged in against both powers close to us so that we do not lose our grasp on militancy or our warrior spirit. They may seek to strike us because we are smaller than them, but they will know just how strong we can be in the heat of battle."
 civil_war_ceremonial_chiefs: "War and Civil Chiefs"
 civil_war_ceremonial_chiefs_desc: "There is a distinction between what chiefs handle war-time affairs and peace-time affairs. We keep this order in place so as to maintain a stable realm for our people; refining this two-chief dynamic as we go on in time will only lead to us being governed better and more efficiently."
 steady_expansion_of_lands: "Steady Expansion of Lands"
 steady_expansion_of_lands_desc: "We take some lessons from the Huron and Iroquois in military traditions, but we must also look at how they have handled a growing population and various growing communities, and then look at how we are handling our own. Is it enough to keep going throughout the ages migrating over and over again? Perhaps not... Perhaps it is time we accept this expansion of our domain and land and settle down for good."
 improving_fighting_styles: "Improving our Fighting Style"
 improving_fighting_styles_desc: "With new ages come new ways of fighting and Meskwaki and Sauk people know this for a fact. Adatping our warriors to at least some of these new ways of fighting will be key to our survival and prosperity; there is no peace and happiness without shedding blood and tears, is there?"

 population_upswing_desc: "Do we not take to the new ages well? Our progress seems to say we do, what with our growing population and expanding communities, we are at a place we could never have dreamed about just a few generations ago.

 refine_the_traditions_of_succession_desc: "One key piece of law and tradition that we must always answer to is succession. How it is handled may have been more complex in the past, but people want change and refinement of the system of succession. If we can compromise with the citizens on a few matters, we can at least make both sides somewhat happy and maybe even clear out some outdated traditions as well."

 turbulent_past_of_kalahandi: "Turbulent Past of Kalahandi"
 turbulent_past_of_kalahandi_desc: "Kalahandi itself has been through a great amount of power shifts between rulers and those who adhere close by to the ruler. The dynamics of these shifts aren't always clear, but the military is always involved in some form. By ensuring that the military is at least curtailed and not capable of seizing all power in Kalahandi, but is actually integrated properly within the state itself, we can organize it in a much better fashion."
 rising_power_of_the_nagas: "Rising Power of the Nagas"
 rising_power_of_the_nagas_desc: "The nagas should never be underestimated. The nagas survived the ancient extermination attempt by Janamejaya, the Kuru king from so long ago, and now they are resurgent today. None will be able to stop the nagas grand rise to prominence in the wake of other powers around us! Let us take back what glory is rightfull ours!"

 adoption_of_new_strategies_from_orissa_desc: "We are entering new times that bring with them interesting new ways of fighting.

 solidify_kalahandi: "Soldify Kalahandi"
 solidify_kalahandi_desc: "On the larger scale of things, Kalahandi is still a disorganized entity with decentralized power being rife throughout, not unlike the history of the land in prior centuries. It might not be easy to do, but attempting to centralize power and to uphold the authority of Kalahandi over chiefs and local leaders may do us more good than we currently anticipate."

Once a great site for trade and agriculture, now it has fallen into disrepair, but there is hope still that it can come back and become like it use to be. The practices we used to build up Old Kaskaskia Village we will never forget as we trudge on into the future."
 the_cahokia_tribe: "The Cahokia Tribe"
 the_cahokia_tribe_desc: "What the Cahokia brought with them to the confederation were 5 chiefs that helped in matters of governance, something that is very much needed when presiding over such a large amount of people groups. By keeping them as they were and slowly evolving the positions they are in, we can ensure a more stable and prosperous future for ourselves."
 the_peiora_tribe: "The Peiora Tribe"
 the_peiora_tribe_desc: "The Peiora tribe is one that united with several others and brought a sense of unity to the confederacy.

 legacy_of_the_13_tribes_desc: "The 13 tribes in total that we encompass within the confederacy will need room to expand in time. Let us go forth an prepare these lands for them to settle in, for they will sow seeds of prosperity and reap the rewards for the wider confederation later on. The other people outside our borders, they cannot do as we do in this sense; they will only spoil the land."
 the_tamaroa_tribe: "The Tamaroa Tribe"
 the_tamaroa_tribe_desc: "The Tamaroa tribe has worked to fight off other neighboring tribes time and time again, and their work inspires the warriors of the confederacy. They will be integral to the survival of our confederacy and we should not take them for granted, for, if we cannot fight our enemies properly, we will become their subjects in time."
 assimilating_other_tribes: "Assimilating Others"
 assimilating_other_tribes_desc: "By now we have become masters at assimilating other groups of people into our greater confederacy. It should not be a surprise that we can continue to attract these people into our fold and integrate them without much of a hassle, it's simply part of being the Illinois Confederacy."
 the_illinois_confederacy: "The Illinois Confederacy"
 the_illinois_confederacy_desc: "Formalizing the entrance into the Illinois Confederacy is what our main focus is currently. Whether by conquest or by peaceful annexation, we will need to make sure that people are welcomed warmly into our fold and that they are accepted for who they are.

There are few who know this outside of Bastar, but as we rise in prominence, it will become central to our foundational canon and we shall not be losing the favor of Danteshwari anytime soon."
 link_to_the_telugus: "Link to the Kakatiya Dynasty"
 link_to_the_telugus_desc: "Though some would dispute this claim, we assert that our founder was actually the brother of the last ruler of the Kakatiya Dynasty (Prataparudra, reign: 1289-1323). We can use this connection to one of the great Telugu dynasties south of us to better enhance our connections around us and in time, build up our successive dynasty like the Kakatiya Dynasty itself."
 keep_bastar_unified: "Keep Bastar Unified"
 keep_bastar_unified_desc: "There is subtle trouble that brews beneath the surface of Bastar, that being the question of succession upon the death of our ruler. Some would prop up a different son or daughter from the chosen heir and attempt to split off from Bastar, but we will take measures to ensure that this does not happen. Central authority will be paramount within our borders and within our court."
 succeed_the_kakatiya_dynasty: "Succeed the Kakatiya Dynasty"
 succeed_the_kakatiya_dynasty_desc: "Their kingdom died out due to the invasions of the Delhi Sultanate, but we live on after them as a successor state if sorts.

 myths_of_the_naga_dynasty_origins_desc: "The legendary epics of old that are still rife within the communities of Jharkhand tell of the nagas as well as other heroes and villains, gods and goddesses alike, tales that have been passed down for generations. We bask in the glory of these old stories and soon enough, we will write our own that will display the grandeur and wonder of our own dynasty and its people, with heroes and villains as well."

 empower_the_kshatriya_varna_desc: "Our upper class, the ruling class, that is, of Jharkhand, is made up of the Kshatriya Varna. For too long they have been tied down by petty political matters and tribal feuds that get in the way of good governance in conjunction with good leadership in military matters.

 feudatory_mandala_traditions: "Feudatory Mandala Traditions"
 feudatory_mandala_traditions_desc: "With how political matters go in and around Ratanpur, feudatories and mandalas are of no issue to us. Having more of them and having them be loyal to us is a sign of greatness, prestige, and power to many and by ensuring that ours (whether they be governed by family or not) are not rebellious, we can propagate our influence outward."

 defend_the_land_of_ratnapura_desc: "What we've built up over the decades must never be given to the enemy, not without the fiercest of fights we can give. Defensive positions and keeping our structures safe is of the utmost priority and keeping the fortifications we need in peak condition is also key to us."

 ratnapura_coinage_reform_desc: "Though some don't think much of it, we of Ratanpur do take the time and effort to overhaul our coinage every now and again.

 finances_of_the_court_in_ratnapura_desc: "With coinage relatively sorted out for ourselves, the matter of finances is the obvious next subject that must be addressed afterwards.

 garjati_oriya_connection_desc: "We are essentially the bridge between the Garjati and Oriya people, what with where we are situated geographically. By being the ones to bridge these gaps between the two cultures and perhaps even more in the future, we can ensure a more stable state for ourselves."
 garjati_fortress_control: "Fortress Control"
 garjati_fortress_control_desc: "The lands of the Garjati people are filled with scattered fortifications that are often under the control of semi-independent tribal chiefs. Subjugating them formally and reining them into the central authority of our state will ensure that we can maintain more forts for less cost, and in time, build up a better model for maintaining fortifications overall."
 garjati_adaptive_warfare: "Adaptive Warfare"
 garjati_adaptive_warfare_desc: "The tropical climate of the Garjati homes are not home to the most stable fighting grounds. Often there are uneven hills, sudden ridges, dense jungles, and uncultivated areas that make warfare much more small-scale and scattered. By adapting our strategy to not only this terrain, but whatever terrain we find ourselves on, we can make the fight for enemies even worse and the fight for us even more advantageous."
 the_meaning_of_gajapati: "The Meaning of 'Gajapati'"
 the_meaning_of_gajapati_desc: "In Odia, Gajapati means 'king with an army of elephants'. Few are willing to take this claim seriously due to our relatively small powerbase, but once we expand and field elephants on a grand scale, modernizing them at the same time, our enemies will know the true meaning behind our name."
 continue_architectual_work: "Continue Architectual Work"
 continue_architectual_work_desc: "We may take lesseson from the Gajapati Kingdom in several ways, but we are still keen on developing our own standards for certain things, one of which being architecture.

 remember_the_work_of_ramai_deva_desc: "Ramai Deva, our Rajput founder, was the one who took down the previous unstable authority of oligarchs in the region and enthroned himself into the seat of power, creating a strong and stable foundation for a lasting dynastic state.

 enforcing_authority_in_patna: "Enforcing Authority in Patna"
 enforcing_authority_in_patna_desc: "The authority within Patna can sometimes be weak and without much force behind it due to networks of communication being relatively slow.

 revive_the_military_prowess_from_ramai_deva_desc: "The disciplined state Ramai Deva created in his time must not be forgotten, especially in the vein of our military.

They were one of the few who were able to hold out against the likes of the Delhi Sultanate and its ruthless conquests, but alas, the glory of the Eastern Gangas did not last.

 cultivation_of_keonjhar: "Cultivation of Keonjhar"
 cultivation_of_keonjhar_desc: "There is a need for us to build up the central structure of Keonjhar beyond just a petty village. A place where a grand court can be built and where the citizens can walk around with pride in their heart and soul, that is what Keonjhar will be; it all starts with us being willing to invest in the development of the rugged terrain."

 to_be_a_raja_and_beyond_desc: "Some see us a petty chiefdom, but we are so much more than that. Our ruler, the raja, needs to become smart and skillful in all areas of life, but he also needs to be strong in his will to have an up-right and astute court backing him, otherwise he has no power. If this can be satisfied, then perhaps our raja can become more than what he currently is."

 coming_together_of_various_traditions_desc: "Just as past powers came for Jeypore, various cultures left their mark too and even today we experience a vast amount of varied cultural influence.

 reform_the_dynastic_succession_desc: "To us the way of succession in Jeypore is often messy and chaotic and often times it leads to issues regarding power and money.

 taming_the_garjat_states_desc: "Picking up where our ancestors in Patna left off, it is our duty to stabilize the inner areas of Odisha and to put down the ambitions of petty chiefs and local rulers.

Tlemcen shall not fall, not to the likes of our age-old rivals!"
 corsair_bases: "Corsair Bases"
 corsair_bases_desc: "As with any good North African state, we too use the likes of corsairs to our advantage.

 promote_cultural_unity_of_tlemcen_desc: "There is a key thing missing in Tlemcen that will be the breaking point of us if we are not careful: cultural unity.

It is our duty to ensure this does not happen at any cost."
 stopping_the_reliance_on_mercenaries: "Relying on Ourselves"
 stopping_the_reliance_on_mercenaries_desc: "Mercenaries are nice at times for when we absolutely are in need of them, but too often we find them more costly than they are worth and wavering in their loyalty toward us.

 jauhar_desc: "This seemingly horrid act is a form self-immolation by Hindu women in particular in order avoid capture, enslavement, and other atrocities that could be committed by hostile forces seeking them out in the midst of certain defeat (that is, defeat on the side of the Hindu women). This act has mostly been seen occurring during the various Muslim invasions of the subcontinent and there have been prominent cases of jauhar happening in Jaisalmer's history.

 anti_siege_attacks_desc: "We have since our inception been forced to learn the ways of siege warfare and it isn't easy in the slightest. What we have learned, however, is that sorties and anti-siege attacks from within and from outside fortifications can be extremely useful and it's something we of Jaisalmer should perfect. How and where can we practice? Jaisalmer Fort is a prime target."

 resurgence_of_the_bhati_rajputs_desc: "The time has now come to proclaim a new age for the rajput people. The Bhati Rajputs are no longer the weak subgroup of rajputs as they had been before, but rather they are now one of the top clans around and ready to take up the mantle as leader of Rajasthan.

 rajput_conflicts: "Rajput Conflicts"
 rajput_conflicts_desc: "The rajput are rarely ever truly united on a single cause. Clans will disagree greatly on one matter or another and it's only when there is a common enemy for all rajputs that we have seen unity amongst all clans. As such, we must take advantage of this rajput infighting and see if Jangladesh can proclaim itself more than what it seems to be on the surface."
 construction_of_fortifications: "Fortify Jangladesh"
 construction_of_fortifications_desc: "Much like other rajput states, we of Jangladesh are going to need to build fortifications and protective barriers against foreign invaders.

 the_threat_of_bengal_desc: "The Muslim invasions of the 1000s and to 1200s were some of the most frightening times for the traditional Hindu and Jain states of Northern India.

Let us, the people of the Koch Kingdom, stand firm against these threats and with our Hindu brothers and sisters in oppose the Muslims like other states have before in India."

 bhuyan_chiefs_as_allies_desc: "In times of turmoil, the rough and informal yet effective network of Bhuyan Chiefs that lay scattered in the region have come to our aid against the likes of the Bengal Sultanate.

 settle_the_turbulent_times_after_the_pala_desc: "When the last great Buddhist power in India faded, this being the Pala Empire centered in the Bengal region, the turmoil left behind was rife in every area possible.

Still, people make a living out here and have raised up powerful kingdoms in the past, some of which were larger and smaller than us.

 build_up_the_mel_mandap_desc: "The Mel mandap is the council hall where representatives and other officials meet in order to flesh out the legislation and administration of Kachar.

Let us show them that we will be able to resist such invasions and thwart their attempts at subjugation."
 capital_fortress_town_orchha: "Capital Fortress Town"
 capital_fortress_town_orchha_desc: "To have an open capital ripe for invasion is foolish, is it not?

 evolve_pawnee_warfare: "Evolving Warfare"
 evolve_pawnee_warfare_desc: "There isn't a simple way in which we can go about surviving in this new age of warfare, administration, and diplomacy. We have tried diplomatic measures, but too often we see that the Pawnee are degraded into a second-class state and are helpless in negotiations. If it continues to come to this, then the Pawnee will prove to these foreigners that they can fight just as well as they can, perhaps even better."

 calculated_expansion_desc: "Once we are settled enough, the Pequot people should venture forth into new lands surrounding our home with weapons at the ready. Few if any would see our expansion as a good thing and thus they may take up arms against us, but we will be ready for them if they do so."

 empower_the_pequot_people_desc: "Despite what we have been through, our people are learning from the past and becoming a more unified group that can work as one toward a common goal, so long as it pertains to the benefit of the Pequot people in general.

 governing_the_pequot_people_desc: "We must not become negligent in how we govern the land and its people, for they will answer only to a strong and centralized authority.

 promote_the_oodham_language_desc: "Our language (called O'odham) is a distinct characteristic of our people and would mature if we were to promote it universally throughout our realm instead of having it be intermixed with other languages.

 resource_competition: "Resources Competition"
 resource_competition_desc: "The vast plains are valuable for the amount of wild game that can be hunted but not only this, fertile land by rivers is also valuable to a great many people for the resources produced.

 ruthless_warfare_desc: "Traditional, older styles of warfare are too weak and too mild for the changing times that are upon the Susquehannock people.

This is what will set us apart and make us better than our rivals."
 recover_from_disasters: "Recovering from Disasters"
 recover_from_disasters_desc: "When a fire destroys parts of our villages and towns, or storms ruin crops for our people, we need to be sure that the central government of the Susquehannock Confederacy can handle these disasters and not have rampant decentralization occur when these events happen.

 the_notion_of_trade: "Increasing Trade Opportunities"
 the_notion_of_trade_desc: "Ever since those foreign people started showing up on our shores, the demand for resources like furs has risen dramatically.

We aren't traders by nature, but we can at least endeavor to profit from this."
 susquehannock_dominance: "Susquehannock Dominance"
 susquehannock_dominance_desc: "When we conquer new lands, we shall not lay down a harsh code upon our enemies.

 caliphate_influences: "Influences from the Caliphates"
 caliphate_influences_desc: "There are unmistakable marks in Lebanon left behind by the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates. Though we are not completely Islamic, the Islamic legacy our home region has is both prestigious and valuable to many people across different regions such as Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and North Africa. Keeping the legacy of the Caliphates alive, whether it is in maintaining mosques or old palaces or other structures, will ensure that we are valued by more than just our own people."
 methodic_religious_governance: "Methodic Religious Governance"
 methodic_religious_governance_desc: "To govern such a diverse population of people is no easy task and the Lebanese administration has indeed had its struggles trying to sort out how the religions and cultures should and shouldn't interact. By focusing efforts on this matter in the future and trying to decipher better ways of governing our people, we can look forward to a tolerant and united future."
 lebanese_identity: "Lebanese Identity"
 lebanese_identity_desc: "After such a long time of being under the authority of other powers, the Lebanese people are finally coming into their own being. They are realizing now that there is a common sense of family between the Lebanese people and that other powers around them will only seek to smite them down."
 lebanese_trade_potential: "Lebanese Potential"
 lebanese_trade_potential_desc: "As time goes on, Lebanon is one to become a trade hub, a diplomatic hub, and a grand nation the likes of which few could dream of. Conquest is but a mere side show for us, for the pride we take in maintaining ourselves and our own peace is what we truly value."

 break_down_of_ajuran: "Break Down of Ajuran"
 break_down_of_ajuran_desc: "As the power of Ajuran continues to decline, we must be ready to fight for our rightful place amongst other Somali clans and states. Drilling our troops and enforcing higher standards within our military will be needed if plan on sustaining our position of authority."
 the_geledi_clan_ascendant: "The Geledi Clan"
 the_geledi_clan_ascendant_desc: "A grand source of our power is the Geledi clan itself. No matter if they hold the office of power or not, they hold a great amount of influence within our state and supply both legitimacy, societal cohesion, and a sort of regal presence throughout. We will need all of this if we hope to succeed in the future."
 core_at_the_jubba_and_sheblle: "Core at the Jubba and Shebelle Rivers"
 core_at_the_jubba_and_sheblle_desc: "The core rivers which we call part of our heartland are the Jubba and Shebelle Rivers and they are invaluable for many areas in what is traditionally seen as Somali land south of the direct tip of the Horn of Africa. Monopolizing access over these rives like our predecessors did will allow us to profit greatly from trade."
 command_the_arms_trade: "Command of the Arms Trade"
 command_the_arms_trade_desc: "Firearms are valuable to a great many people throughout East Africa and we are no exception. Our strategic position allows us to take a commanding influence in the arms trade and as we do, our military will be able to more effectively field these advanced weapons rather than our outdated traditional arms."
 connect_with_muslim_dynasties: "Connecting with Other Dynasties"
 connect_with_muslim_dynasties_desc: "There are several other Muslim dynasties around us and as our predecessors have done, we would be wise to make diplomatic ties with them where and when possible. Rivals will be abound, but we should not make enemies of every nation around and state around us."
 designated_structure_for_war: "Structured Way for War"
 designated_structure_for_war_desc: "The way we conduct war is more structured than surrounding states. The Geledi clan has imbued us with a sense of structure in our leadership during times of war and we will conduct ourselves with a strict council of officers and generals."
 jihad_in_east_africa: "Jihad!"
 jihad_in_east_africa_desc: "As we come into contact with more and more Christians who see us as beneath them, our leadership is becoming more and more inclined to declare holy wars against them so as to preserve our way of life and our way of worship. They say their faith leads them to conquer lands around us, we say our faith leads us against their ambitions."

 connections_along_east_africa: "Connections Along East Africa"
 connections_along_east_africa_desc: "East Africa is filled with many trade cities that seek to earn profit and establish good relations with a variety of people and Malindi is no exception. Thankfully we already have a good set of connections along the coast and we can capitalize on this diplomatic foundation in the future when we need to make more relations elsewhere."
 swahili_buildings: "Swahili Buildings"
 swahili_buildings_desc: "There are a great many buildings of Swahili design and style here. There are so many that our builders and laborers have become well versed in constructing them in a timely fashion since Malindi is a prospering and growing city. This skill is going to become more and more useful as time goes on for us since the city expansions will make room for new buildings."
 trade_in_ivory_and_horns: "Trading in Ivory and Horns"
 trade_in_ivory_and_horns_desc: "What Malindi is known for is trading, particularly in the fields of ivory and rhino horns. Ensuring that we are the dominant forces in these respective markets will ensure that Malindi's economic sector is never at stake, and from here we can slowly expand this hold into other resources as well."
 welcoming_of_foreigners: "Welcoming of Foreigners"
 welcoming_of_foreigners_desc: "Foreign people should never be turned away from Malindi if they seek to do no harm! We should welcome them into our land and attempt to establish ties with them instead, who knows what they could offer us and what we could offer them in exchange. Mutualistic relationships are much better than hostile relationships, for hostility often brings strain to trade."
 maritime_rivalries: "Maritime Rivalries"
 maritime_rivalries_desc: "Peace is good and valuable, but Malindi and its people cannot deny that rivalries occur and fighting breaks out amongst the states of East Africa. Most warfare is decided out at sea, however, since most of the profitable trade that people fight over flows via oceanic trade routes, so we'd be wise to ensure that our sailors and admirals are well versed in naval warfare both at range and up close."
 inland_connections: "Assimilate Inland"
 inland_connections_desc: "We don't have serious connections inland but we do have some. These ties are greatly valued by those of Malindi since they (as well as foreign traders and families who stay in Malindi permanently) are sources of fighters and sailors, both of which we need to survive and thrive."

 become_the_heart_of_the_region_desc: "It can be said there are many hearts to East Africa, from Mombasa to Malindi to Zanzibar to Mogadishu and even to Sofala, but there must be one to rule them all. Malindi shall be that single entity that rises above the rest and the one that becomes the central beating heart to East Africa, but to attain this status will require action both on the high seas and on the rugged coasts."

 aksumite_heritage_desc: "The history of Shewa as an area of significance goes back several centuries, even back to the times of the Aksumite Empire. Let us never forget what has come before us in the form of states that have come and gone, tales of great people who travelled to and from Shewa, and prestigious people who have settled in Shewa. Their legacy is what we must cultivate as we continue on in the very same place as they were once at."
 ifat_sultanate_ties: "Ties to the Ifat Sultanate"
 ifat_sultanate_ties_desc: "Before our time, there was the Ifat Sultanate that rose to prominence in the east and expanded westward toward Shewa. Often times they would clash with the likes of Christians and this would bring about great battles the likes of which previous states had not seen. The Ifat Sultanate may be gone now, but their legacy of having a fighting spirit against their religious enemies is still imbued within the people of Shewa today."
 history_of_religious_conflict: "History of Religious Conflict"
 history_of_religious_conflict_desc: "Islam and Christianity in this region mix like water and oil, and in the realm of politics, react with flowers of fire and destruction. The people of Shewa are no stranger to this and despite their defensive position in the highlands, still experience the troubles of religious conflict. We must not hide our face from it, no, we must charge at it head-on without fear of death or defeat!"

 memory_of_the_makhzumi_dynasty_desc: "There once was an independent Muslim Shewa Sultanate, back from around the 900s to upon the conquests westward by the Ifat Sultanate in the 1200s. Though the dynasty from that era, the Makhzumi, is no longer around, it's legacy lives on today in the people of our land. They strive for greatness and they uphold the dynasty properly, just as the dynasty in exchange upholds the people of Shewa."
 tensions_with_the_oromo: "Tensions with the Oromo"
 tensions_with_the_oromo_desc: "The Oromo are more than a small issue, they are a contentious ethnic group that often seek to migrate and settle in places that are already inhabited by others, especially Amhara people akin to our own. We need a system of some kind to distinguish between the Oromo and Amhara, a line of separation so that we can root out troubled parts of our state that are most likely Oromo in nature. They've caused issues for us and other Amhara states in the past, we will learn from their failures in this area."
 defense_over_offense: "Defense over Offense"
 defense_over_offense_desc: "The inherent position of Shewa makes defensive strategies more viable and conquest of the land harder. At times the people here have been isolated from the rest of the region and at other times they have been connected somewhat, but the fact remains that defensive placements and a defensive mentality are key to the survival of Shewa."
 religious_deliberation: "Religious Deliberation"
 religious_deliberation_desc: "Navigating the waters of religious tension in the region Shewa finds itself in is no easy matters. Siding with one side or the other will invoke the ire of another side and possible revolts throughout the land or it could invoke retribution from outside the state. Regardless of the dangers, we must be ready to consider carefully the actions we take in the future regarding religion in Shewa, and how we will go about enforcing a state-sponsored religion."

 catholic_orthodox_tensions: "Catholic-Orthodox Tensions"
 catholic_orthodox_tensions_desc: "Between the bastions of Eastern Orthodox Christianity that are in the Russian region and the stalwart Western Christians that are in Scandinavia, Karelians have been caught in between these two religious authorities for ages now. Though we may not find true solace in siding with one or the other, we can at least attempt to mitigate the tension within our own land and promote a common unity between Karelian people despite the differences of faith."
 fief_at_viborg: "The Fief at Viborg"
 fief_at_viborg_desc: "There has been a fiefdom of sorts at Viborg for quite some time and it has done good things for Karelians of the land. Though it was distant from strong central authority due to its location, it did help maintain authority in the area and it helped build up fortifications and a military presence in the region. Why disregard the methods for maintain and develop the land of such a place like Karelia if they come from a power that formally held authority over us? We simply should not; we should be using these methods to make sure Karelia can become more than just a snowy paradise of sorts that lacks actual infrastructure."
 traditions_from_the_days_of_fiefdom: "Traditions from the Fiefdom"
 traditions_from_the_days_of_fiefdom_desc: "The fiefdomn days not only helped maintain the land, but it also helped maintain a solid and continous flow of tax revenue to a central authority, something that has been hard to do in a region such as Karelia. By conforming this taxation method to the Karelian government and also learning how the fiefdom conducted defensive measures, we will be much better suited to grow as a state."
 margrave_traditions: "Margrave Traditions"
 margrave_traditions_desc: "The commanders of Viborg Castle itself were margraves in function and practice. Taking into account how they worked for the Swedish crown and how they managed the land in terms of military forces, we can begin to cultivate a sustainable and cogent Karelian military force."
 build_up_the_defensive_positions: "Defensive Positioning"
 build_up_the_defensive_positions_desc: "Strengthening the defenses of Karelia will only serve to make us harder to invade and few people would even venture to our heartland to even visit us, let alone invade us. Let us make sure this sentiment is echoed throughout the years by fortifying ourselves with stronger walls, greater garrisons, and more competent defensive strategies."
 promote_independent_identity: "Promote an Independent Identity"
 promote_independent_identity_desc: "We are neither Russian nor Swedish, but something else altogether. Since before the 11th century we have been around, influencing matters in both Sweden and Novgorod and elsewhere in neighboring regions and throughout this all, from our highest point to our lowest point, we have maintained ourselves as different. We shall always continue to do so as time goes on, no matter the cost."
 keepers_of_the_icy_north: "Keepers of the Icy North"
 keepers_of_the_icy_north_desc: "Let them come forth to the iced over and snow packed northern regions, the hostile forces that seek to destroy shall suffer in agony all along the way while the Karelian soldiers and civilians await, perfectly capable of withstanding the climate and weather. The only people that can really rival our nature in this regard are the Finnish, the Sami, and maybe the Siberian people. The Russians can claim to best us, but we all know that the Karelians are better adapted to the cold than they are."

 golden_horde_remnant_desc: "We were once so great, so illustrious, so powerful... But now, we are a shadow, a husk, a mere withering frame of our former self. We must not lose heart nor hope in this dire time, we must be prepared to reinstate what influence we had around us. Those who broke away from us must know that our banners are not yet buried and that our desire for greatness has not been put out. The Great Horde will rise once again!"

 hostilities_on_all_sides_desc: "From Nogay to Kazan, and from Azov to Moskva, we are surrounded by hostile powers who seek to dismantle the last great remaining vestige of the Golden Horde. Our officers and generals must not lose heart at the sight of these hostile powers, but rather they must be emboldened to retake what was once ours. Through innovative tactics and strategies, we will take back what was once ours."
 the_status_of_sarai: "The Status of Sarai"
 the_status_of_sarai_desc: "Sarai holds the core traditions of the Golden Horde. Though its status and prosperity may have dwindled since the 1300s, it still remains a strong status symbol in the region and must remain so for the future. Renovating it and building it back up will only increase our legitimate claims to the lands we once held as our own."
 reinstate_golden_horde_influence: "Reinstate Golden Horde Influence"
 reinstate_golden_horde_influence_desc: "The khanates that separated away from us remember our influence and how the Golden Horde ruled over the land, such memories cannot be erased.

 modernize_horde_weaponry: "Modernize our Weapons"
 modernize_horde_weaponry_desc: "The traditional weapons of our ancestors are increasingly becoming ineffective against the likes of our neighbors to the west and south. Gunpowder weapons are what will carry forth combat in the future and the steppe people must adapt to this soon if they wish to live to see the coming years."
 reinstating_subject_tributaries: "Reinstate Tributaries"
 reinstating_subject_tributaries_desc: "The tributary states that the Golden Horde called their own were unruly at times, but they kept the system of tribute flowing and helped the Golden Horde prosper. We should reinstate this system of tributaries but also be ready to reform it as time goes on so that we do not end up with break-away states near our border."
 stable_politics: "Stable Politics"
 stable_politics_desc: "If there was one central issue that sapped the health of the Golden Horde, it was breaks in the political system. Assassinations, usurpations, corrupt officials, and bribed generals, they all contributed to our downfall from before and led us directly to where we are now as the Great Horde. Through concrete reformation efforts though, we can formalize the government institutions and offices and ensure that our political situation is less prone to breaking down."

We still are facing trouble here in the north, but our troops are more than willing fight in their homeland and for a righteous cause, especially when it is for reuniting the old domain."
 reunite_the_yuan_lands: "Reunite the Old Lands"
 reunite_the_yuan_lands_desc: "Once, our lands stretched from the steppe homelands of the north to down south toward the jungles of Dai Viet, but now we are fighting for survival back where our ancestors started at. It will not be easy in the slightest, but our once grand empire must come about again and we must reunite what we once lost."
 rebuild_karakorum: "Rebuild Karakorum"
 rebuild_karakorum_desc: "Karakorum was sacked and destroyed in 1388 by the Ming Dynasty, leading to a decline in legitimacy and power for all of the remaining Yuan Dynasty. If we ever hope to bring about real legitimacy to the Yuan Dynasty again, Karakorum would be a great place to start that isn't related to conquest since it can be a foundational element to regaining our legitimacy in the eyes of the people and the eyes of the military."
 adapting_gunpowder_usage: "Adapting Gunpowder Usage"
 adapting_gunpowder_usage_desc: "Gunpowder usage is semi-regular throughout the ranks of our soldiers, but the presistence of traditional methods of fighting are hindering us more and more as we head into the future. We must adapt gunpowder weapons completely, integrating them into the military of the Yuan Dynasty so that we can better hold our own in conflicts."
 ancestral_claims: "Ancestral Claims"
 ancestral_claims_desc: "Those who see our resurgence will undoubtedly know that it is a legitimate power reclaiming the lands it once lost. The Oirat and other Mongol tribes may protest our actions, but the senior officials and families throughout know exactly where we come from and where our ancestral claims come from."
 chinese_administrative_measures: "Chinese Administrative Measures"
 chinese_administrative_measures_desc: "We have taken some of the administrative ways of the Chinese and used them for our own purposes, but learning and then integrating the techniques used took quite a while for our people to fully implement. Continuing to use the what we learned from our time in the Middle Kingdom will be key to us managing the land we take back."

 yuan_resurgence_desc: "Let the lands of our ancestors come back into the fold of Great Yuan, and let those who oppose the reclaiming of the land face the might of a renewed and revitalized military fielded by the rightful claimants to the Mandate of Heaven!

 recovery_from_the_mongol_invasion_desc: "In the midst of the 1300s, as the once great Mongol Empire was split up and the successor states were tearing themselves apart, Bukhara was still feeling the ravages of what the Mongols did to the city. We must never forget how these scars on our heart came to be, but we must also not let them bind us into the past; we must recover and become a prosperous center of culture, art, learning, and trade for all of Central Asia just as we once were."
 intellect_center_of_the_islamic_world: "Old Intellectual Center"
 intellect_center_of_the_islamic_world_desc: "After the fall of the Sogdians and with the rise of influential Caliphates in the south, Bukhara experiences a golden age of sorts under the Samanids. During the time of the Samanids, Bukhara's people may have still worshipped idols at times along with others following Islam, but their work at building Bukhara up made it into an intellectual center of the Islamic world. If we are to truly succeed our past, we must meet this legacy and transcend it with our work in all facets of the state, whether it be in religion, in politics, or in society itself."
 improve_public_education: "Improve Public Education"
 improve_public_education_desc: "Steppe life did not readily allow for us to educate the populace like we would want. We have seen what kind of marvels settled life can bring and what achievements in thought and innovation the public can bring about if they are educated enough; indeed much of the Persian heartland and its history is an example of this and we would do well to follow this example and begin large efforts to improve the education of the Bukharan populace."
 settling_from_the_steppe: "Settling from the Steppe"
 settling_from_the_steppe_desc: "In no way is it easy to go from nomadic and semi-nomadic steppe life to settled life; the culture of the people changes and so to does the politics that stem from them. We are not without experience in this matter, however, as we have been attempting to handle this matter for decades now and will continue to do so as time goes on. There is no panacea to this drastic change in life styles for thousands upon thousands of people, but our administrative efforts can certainly attempt to help them out."
 utilizing_fire_and_shock: "Fire and Shock"
 utilizing_fire_and_shock_desc: "If there is one thing that Bukhara will need for its survival, it is a strong military sector. Protecting the archives and scholars and attracting more requires safe passage and safe cities, no? Therefore we must not stay stagnant in our ways of the past with largely cavalry-based armies that use shock tactics primarily. We should be looking to modernize and adapt our weapons so that we can compete with other states around us, but also we must recognize that our traditional fighting style still does offer advantages in certain situations. Much like how Bukhara is a merging of cultures and traditions, it can be the sight of merging fighting styles."
 persian_cannoneer_experience: "Persian Cannoneers"
 persian_cannoneer_experience_desc: "The Persian people, though at times hostile to us and at other times friendly to us, are skilled in their usage of new weapons, especially the larger caliber ones that are found in sieges and extensive military engagements. We have reports that they have frequently used them against the Turks of the west in Mesopotamia and Anatolia, so perhaps hiring and recruiting Persian soldiers who specialize in cannons can do us good."
 patronize_learning_and_arts: "Patronize Scholars and Artists"
 patronize_learning_and_arts_desc: "Much like our old self, Bukhara is blossoming into a place of artistic brilliance and scholarly wonder. From madrasahs to mosques to temples to palatial estates, we have a myriad of places that are attracting great people from not only the Islamic world, but also other places too. From poets to physicians to traders and more, Bukhara is once again becoming a source of life and light for the entirety of Central Asia."

 ostyak_and_sibirian_land_desc: "The land of the Ostyak and Sibirian people is harsh, cold, and undeveloped when compared to the southern lands. Our home villages in these lands  hidden away whilst our enemies seek it out when they invade, and whilst they roam around, they will feel the cold touch of winter bind them into an icy grave."
 islam_and_shamanism: "Islam and Shamanism"
 islam_and_shamanism_desc: "We are by far the northern-most political entity in which Islam is the dominant religion, but we must realize that indigenous Shamanist beliefs of the northern people are prominent within our domain. We must not be so readily discriminatory toward them as that will only bring about instability to the entire realm; rather, we should be tolernat and understanding to them, slowly coercing them to being one with Islam over time."
 interconnected_mongol_dynasties: "Interconnected Dynasties"
 interconnected_mongol_dynasties_desc: "Throughout the many lands that the once might Mongol Empire conquered, the descendants are now split into several different but still related dynasties. Even we in the far north are connected to this web of dynastic descendants and it is because of this that we can easily enforce our authority over the lands we conquer throughout the steppe and beyond."
 forest_fighting_methods: "Forest Fighting Methods"
 forest_fighting_methods_desc: "The nature of fighting in the far north has made us change our tactics somewhat from how the steppe hordes would normally do combat. Because of the dense forests of the far north, we are more adept at breaking huge cavalry charges and breaking down general shock tactics that some would be used to."

 cogent_relations_with_the_mirzas_desc: "The nobles of our land, the Mirzas, are needed to maintain control over the wide open land. Though we don't have sprawling urban settlements, we do have sizeable settlements that require local authorities to enforce control over them so that we can maintain unity and stability throughout."
 assimilation_of_siberians: "Assimilation of Siberians"
 assimilation_of_siberians_desc: "They aren't seen as the most capable fighters, but we know we can outfit them with the equipment they need. Siberians come into and out of our land regularly and sometimes look for work, who says we can't pay them to fight for us when we need them most?"

 home_of_islam_mecca_medina_desc: "From the time of Muhammad in the mid-600s to now, Mecca and Medina have been the religious centers by which Muslims travel to and pray to. Its custody and protection and ownership remains a large subject in several circles in our own nation as it gives us both prestige and reputation amongst other Islamic nations. On top of this, the firm control over the two sites gives us a degree of religious authority, attracting a number of Islamic scholars and imams of which some wish to spread the message of Islam to other lands. Who are we to hold them back from doing so?"
 legacy_of_islamic_conquest: "Legacy of Islamic Conquest"
 legacy_of_islamic_conquest_desc: "The great Caliphates of the past may be stuck in the archives we built, destroyed by various causes that led to a fracturing in the Islamic world at varying points, but their legacy lives on through us. Islamic conquest carried out by them is not lost on us and we are set on reviving it. Already there are soldiers of ours who deem in an honor to conquer in the name of Islam, yet restraint must be maintained with even the most zealous of soldiers in our service. Conquest must not mean brutal population treatment, but rather working with them and working to bring them into the wider Islamic world."

 succeed_the_caliphates_desc: "Where our predecessors once stood, others took their place and divided the spoils they left behind. This must be rectified by a true successor Caliphate that can maintain not only political authority, but religious authority as well. The system of succession must be refined and the court of ours must have strict order within it so that we do not fall prey to the various court schemes that plagued our ancestors."
 arabian_trade_connections: "Arabian Trading Conenctions"
 arabian_trade_connections_desc: "For centuries, Arabian merchants travelled along the coasts of the Indian Ocean to far away lands, sharing and gathering information along the way whilst also spreading the word of Islam to new communities along the way. Though spreading the word of the prophet is certainly needed, we must not forget these trade connections in the slightest. The revenue they can bring for us if utilized well enough is not insignificant and by connectiing with the scattered trade-based Islamic communities that have sprouted up throughout the centuries, we will be able to extract greater amounts of revenue yet."
 refine_and_transcend_clan_loyalties: "The Notion of Clan Loyalties"
 refine_and_transcend_clan_loyalties_desc: "Tribes and clans of the Arabian Peninsula are numerous and scattered, but they hold significant sway in deciding local matters from places such as San'a, Muscat, Jabal Shammar, and many more. We must communicate clearly with them, establish good relations with the tribes and clans, and ensure that they are loyal to the higher authorities of the land. If we can do this properly, then several local matters in villages and cities will be of little worry compared to if we were actively fighting said tribes and clans."
 protect_the_pilgramages: "Protect the Hajj"
 protect_the_pilgramages_desc: "The Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and it is what helps make Mecca and Medina such prosperous locations despite where they are situated. Our devotion to protecting and upholding the Hajj for all Muslim has led to many recognizing us as good custodians of the holy cities and a true leader in the Islamic world. It would be in our best interest to uphold this reputation we've gained to the best of our ability."
 shbh_aljazirat_alearabia: "Shbh Aljazirat Alearabia, the Arabian Peninsula"
 shbh_aljazirat_alearabia_desc: "For centuries the Arabian Peninsula has been divided, feuding within itself over politics and religion. Whether it was one tribe versus another or Sunnis versus Shiites versus Ibadis, the entirety of the region has known little peace since the time of the last great Caliphate. Now though, through our hard work and astute leadership, we have become the catalayst and the holders of a new golden era of the Arabian Peninsula that sees not division and destruction, but rather cooperation and prosperity. With this, we will do all that we can to defend what we have fought so hard for; and when our enemies are driven back from our great home, we will be sure they never threaten us again."

More and more we are seeing the exports of our carpets and rugs expand as the trade routes around us grow more crowded with people, so why should we stop at what production methods we currently use?

 memory_of_conquest_desc: "When the Seljuk Turks came from the north, Kerman maintained a great deal of independence and made great strides in expanding itself. The leaders of Kerman conquered swaths of land to the south and southeast before being culled by other powers later on. Still, the heart of conquest beats inside of the city and its people, and the memory of the past conquests are not yet lost on our people."
 festivals_of_kerman: "Festivals of Kerman"
 festivals_of_kerman_desc: "Our foundations in the likes of the Sassanid Empire has given us a great deal of tradition and cultural identity that few can compare with.

 more_than_just_an_outpost: "More than an Outpost"
 more_than_just_an_outpost_desc: "Ardashir I, founder of the once great Sassanid Empire, founded Kerman initially as a defensive outpost in the east, thinking little else of the land and the population of Kerman itself afterwards. Times have changed over the centuries, however, and we are more akin to a great city than a mere outpost. From humble foundations upward, we must seize power when and where we can and follow in the footsteps of our great ancestors."
 religious_cohabitation: "Religious Cohabitation"
 religious_cohabitation_desc: "Though Islam is strong in the region of Persia itself (along with Kerman), Zoroastrians are still present within Kerman itself. We understand that there is a need to preserve our cultural history and the Zoroastrians, though heathens as they may be, are intrinsically part of that cultural history. Let us see to it that others of different faiths who also contribute to our culture are not put into exile in our lands."

 iranian_familiarity_desc: "The lands of Persia know us well, but we are but one city of many famous cities in the region.

 religious_tolerance_of_the_past_desc: "From its inception from the times of the Medes to the times of Cyrus the Great and ever afterwards, Isfahan has been a bastion for not only Zoroastrians and Islamic followers, but also Jewish communities as well as Christian communities. Religious tolerance is something that is inherent within the history of our great city and it will continue to guide us long into the future, lest we wish to stray away and delve into religious strife and corrupt religious governance."
 buyid_and_seljuk_prosperity: "Buyid and Seljuk Memories"
 buyid_and_seljuk_prosperity_desc: "After the fall of the great Sassanid Empire to the Arabs of the Rashidun Caliphate, Isfahan was captured in about 642 and progressively built up despite being in the path of conquest. Later on, the Buyid Dynasty as well as the Seljuk Turks continued to build up the splendor and prosperity of Isfahan, culminating into its greatest form under Malik-Shah I (reigned 1073-1092). Though the times are very much different now and cities like Tabriz are taking over, we can very much still build our home city into something as great or even greater than what it once was. Our past tells us of what we are capable of, and it is our past that can help lead us into the future."
 build_the_defenses: "Build the Defenses"
 build_the_defenses_desc: "Isfahan's location is well suited to a defensive position as it lies within the Zagros Mountains, but time and time again there have been invasions that have crossed the mountains and come to where we live. Thus, the goal is clear for us: build up high quality and strong defensive structures along key points so that we can maintain our invaluable position in the mountains. The enemies of Isfahan will die trying to break down our great fortifications."
 beauty_of_persoiranian_architecture: "Beauty of Isfahani Architecture"
 beauty_of_persoiranian_architecture_desc: "The beauty of Isfahan is widespread, but what stands out most to people who are just entering the city for the first time? Why, it is the wondrous architecture of course! The Perso-Islamic style that we have begun to cultivate and promote throughout the entirety of the city and elsewhere is showing more and more people just how illustrious of a city Isfahan is, and with more prestige comes more influence in foreign states. Perhaps in time, others of signficant status will come to admire our hard work and use the wisdom we use in our grand structures."
 cultural_understanding: "Cultural Understanding"
 cultural_understanding_desc: "A great many people pass through Isfahan and those that choose to settle in the city often begin to contribute great amounts of work as future generations of them integrate into the wider Isfahani society. This blending of cultures is not a new notion in the slightest as the Sassanid Empire had a sizeable Jewish community settle within the limits of Isfahan at the time. By continuing this idea of cultural cooperation and understanding, we can be ready to take in new people whenever they come into our fold."

 georgian_military_slaves_desc: "One distinct group of people that we have great connections with are the Georgians of the north. Though different in faith, we often look past the religious differences to cooperate with each other and as such this has culminated in a wonderful military service available perhaps only to Isfahan. The military services of the Georgians have been and will continue to be greatly valued all throughout Isfahan."

 attraction_to_international_trade_desc: "Isfahan was once the heart of the Persian people and the entire region itself, was it not? The lofty place we were once atop is now so far away from it seems, but it is not out of reach. Already we are making strides to retake the prominent position we once had and already many around us are seeing us as a respectable state for the region itself. With this in mind, states beyond our home region are even noticing us and sending a plethora of merchants our way in order to do business. Who are we to deny them this lucrative right? Who are we to stop the growth of Isfahan in this new age of prosperity?"

 relation_to_the_jalayirs_desc: "Though quite distant in their prominence as they converted to Islam and attempted to found their own state in the west, the Jalayirs are still related at the very core to us Khalkhas. We can use our connections with them to help mediate disputes when we conquer new land, especially in lands that harbor Islamic communities toward the western parts of the old Mongol Empire."

 buddhist_haven_of_the_north_desc: "The Khalkha are staunchly Buddhist in their faith and traditions and they are not set on changing from this, despite what Islamic traditions come from the west and what Confucian principles may come from the south. However, we of the Khalkha must recognize that the other faiths are not inherently destructive to the Khalkha way of life or way of governance. If we can fully realize this and make efforts to promote religious harmony whilst also preserving our Buddhist roots, we'll be able to maintain firm control over own land."

 oirat_and_zungar_tensions_desc: "The Oirat and Zunghar are not simple enemies that have popped up, they are rivals of us and seek hegemony of these great lands just like we do. Throughout ruthless diplomacy and strategic warfare, we must subdue these other two groups of Mongols and project the unity brought forth by the early years of the Mongol Empire."
 learning_diplomatic_matters: "Learning Diplomatic Matters"
 learning_diplomatic_matters_desc: "Diplomacy has never been a great field for Mongol people in the past; at best we were standard at it, but others around us excelled in the diplomatic realm and got advantages over us in the past. By practicing our diplomatic approach inside our own land between tribes and between different administrative branches, we can prepare ourselves for conducting astute and careful diplomacy with foreigners."
 unite_the_disparate_mongol_tribes: "Unite the Mongol Tribes"
 unite_the_disparate_mongol_tribes_desc: "The basis for the ambition to unite the entirety of the Mongol tribes is within a great many people, but to fully realize this ambition into something whole, one must learn more. The Khalkha are ready for this next step of cultural understanding and cooperation as the many different groups that inhabit the lands north of the Middle Kingdom will need to be accepted and integrated rather than excluded and persecuted."
 organization_of_the_khalkhas: "Organizing the Khalkhas"
 organization_of_the_khalkhas_desc: "The system of old tribes and clans has done us well for a long time, but the Khalkhas are changing like many other people around us. They are learning, adapting, and changing in their culture on the largest scale we administrate from all the way down to the individual Khalkha person. We need not halt this change over time, rather, we need to learn how to organize ourselves within these changes and manage how they are implemented throughout our society. If we can do so, not even time itself will pose a threat to the Khalkha people."

Being outside of the Middle Kingdom and in the vast steppe region, our history is undoubtedly intertwined with the legends of before, such as the Four Oirats, the Northern Yuan, the Uzbeks, the Kazakhs, and many other groups. Zungharia is but a small part of this entire place, but it is our homeland and as any homeland should, it deserves to be united through any means possible."

Whoever shows the most martial prowess and the greatest leadership skills in the steppe is the one that comes out on top and we of Zungharia will show this through the fires of war. The Khalkhas will submit to the true authority of the steppe that are the leaders of Zungharia."

 cut_down_pretenders_desc: "Our power may seem secure to those outside of our realm, but on the inside, we know there are people who plot the downfall of the Zunghar people and their state. Whether in the form of palace coups or open separatist revolts, we must actively work to gather information on these groups of rebels and cut them down before they can prove to be deadly to us."
 influences_in_tibet: "Influences in Tibet"
 influences_in_tibet_desc: "Long have the hordes of the steppe had interests in the lands of Tibet as the Dalai Lama, the foremost spiritual leader for our branch of Buddhism, hails from and is usually found inside Tibetan land. By extending our influence beyond our nominal borders and using our connections through faith, we can promote not only a greater spiritual unity amongst the Zunghar people, but also a greater legitimate authority over the entirety of the steppe."

 buying_new_weaponry_desc: "From the west and the south, new weapons are coming in that are far more effective than our traditional bow-and-arrow, even on horseback.

 take_the_throne_of_the_steppe_desc: "The steppe is a harsh place full of warring states and different people groups, but there was a time of unity throughout that we look back upon fondly. Yes, the Mongol Empire is no more, but that does not mean another state cannot claim the throne they left vacant! The Zunghars will be the next in line to claim this throne and will be the ones to bring unity to the steppe once more, just as they already have to Zungharia."

Perhaps in time we can conquer back east and greet our old family members."

 surrounding_military_influences_desc: "The Russian military and the Turkish military are influential on us, just like how we as a political entity are influential on them. Though we are used to more cavalry-based tactics that have served us well in the Steppe for decades upon decades, the new weapons and strategies brought to light by the Russians and Turks should be examined thoroughly and in time, integrated into our own military."
 experience_in_rough_terrain: "Rough Terrain Combat"
 experience_in_rough_terrain_desc: "The land we fight in (whether it be for ourselves or because of mercenary contracts) is often harsh and brutal. Mountains, deserts, arid and infertile land, all are places where the Kalmyks have fought in for various reasons and it is through these experiences that they become enduring soldiers that can withstand these harsh conditions."

 maintain_kalmyk_authority_desc: "If there is one thing that was evident in our lands, it was political disunity. Even today this trait runs through the Kalmyks since in the past we have faced times where different groups of people proclaim a different khan than the actual one in line for the throne. We must work to resolve these political struggles as they go on and then work to make sure they are few and far between in the future.

Seeing that arrangements were well and good, and because we were not in any position to really resist, we agreed and became subjects for generations on end. Now though, the Mongols are broken and shattered, scavenging for resources and leadership whilst the Buryats roam free again. We must not hasten to do away with everything the Mongols taught us in our past as their military leadership and organization is something that we should always keep with us through the future."

It has been passed down to us for generations now with varying influences from the southern religions of Buddhism and Tengrism, but the notion of our people and our own religion has not gone away despite there being no holy text or scripture to follow. We should not, however, be closed off to the old religious influences, for they too can relate to our own and may hold wisdom for the Buryats themselves."

 migration_and_semi_nomadic_life_desc: "The harsh lands we live in does not lend itself easily to a settled life full of agriculture. The tundre and cold weather often make life difficult for settled folks to thrive in, thus encouraging more of a semi-nomadic way of life, which the Buryats have had for centuries now. With this in mind, we have not and will not have any issue moving supplies, troops, or people around when the time comes."

The Chahars in relation to have been used as part of tumens before and to this day have a strong memory of this, meaning that they can be recruited, armed, and prepared for combat much faster than other people or states.

 crossroads_of_mongols_and_chinese_desc: "Our core location is near enough to the Chinese that we encounter them quite often on an individual basis. Though there is a distinct different between Chinese culture and Mongol culture, the Chahars serve as a bridge between these two cultures and allow for a more flexible diplomatic position overall. Precarious positions sometimes offer benefits not initially seen."

Just as the navy was integral to the conquest of various lands, our navy will be needed so that we can expand our own borders. As trade is the life-blood of Malaya, we must not let our rivals drain this away from us by holding valued centers of trade and important harbors; thus, we must conquer, annex, and integrate for the greater good that is the nation of Malaya."

 reform_the_kingdom_desc: "The kingdom has lasted a very long time with peaceful and terible times mixed in throughout its life but still it remains alive. Reforms and people ready to reform are needed for Welayta to survive even longer and we will be looking to hire such people who can help push through forward-minded legislation in the decades to come."

 horses_to_ethiopia: "Horses to Ethiopia"
 horses_to_ethiopia_desc: "In the past, we have contributed tribute to Ethiopia in the form of horses amongst other resources. We should be inclined to use some of these horses for our own military rather than giving them all to Ethiopia since they will surely get horses from other places, not just Janjiro."
 the_mwa_clan: "The Mwa Clan"
 the_mwa_clan_desc: "The Mwa Clan is the clan from where many of our leaders have been elected from and to this day they still continue be influential in our politics to this day. Though the power of the Mwa Clan shifts around as time goes on, we should not underestimate their power and we should continue to utilize their influence to help promote our lead dynasty."
 janjiros_isolation: "Janjiros Isolation"
 janjiros_isolation_desc: "Traditionally we have been isolated from several other kingdoms and states due to our location. The mountains and rivers make for nearly impassable terrain entrances into Janjiro land and it is because of this isolation that we can administrate the land much better than other places. Keeping track of communities is fairly easy and building up laws of land is also fairly easy as compared to having huge tracts of land that are hard to manage."
 no_soldier_killed_in_action: "No Soldier Lost In Battle!"
 no_soldier_killed_in_action_desc: "We must not let our enemies drip the blood of our own soldiers on our own land! Should a soldier wounded in battle come back to Janjiro, they will be given blessings by our leader and executed by their own family members. Our enemies can't claim to have killed Janjiro soldiers in battle for they are the greatest warriors around! Let our enemies taste no victory in our land!"
 control_the_raging_rivers: "Controlling the Rivers"
 control_the_raging_rivers_desc: "The rivers around us are known for keeping our heartland fairly isolated but they are not alone in trying to gain easy access across them. If we can build sufficent bridges, learn the regular changes in the flow of the rivers, or perhaps build strong enough boats to go across the rivers, we can achieve a greater amount of overall movement speed for our military and civilian population which will be useful in the future."
 contacts_with_ethiopia: "Contacts with Ethiopia"
 contacts_with_ethiopia_desc: "As we progressively come out of our isolation, what will help us greatly is our connection to Ethiopia. Diplomatic endeavors through them has introduced us slowly to the wider world, easing us into things rather than just dropping us into the international stage without experience."
 the_three_mountains: "The Three Mountains"
 the_three_mountains_desc: "Mount Bor Ama, Mount Azulu, and Mount Toba are the three traditional mountain markers of the Kingdom of Janjiro. They are our foundation, the bedrock by which we built up a secure yet isolated life; the three mountains are what continue to help give our poeple strength whether it is times of natural disasters or in times of deadly plagues. No person may tear our foundation down; no nation may conquer the mountains like we have."

 horses_of_hadiya: "Horses of Hadiya"
 horses_of_hadiya_desc: "Hadiya is a place rich in horses and other resources that are valuable for making a nation grand and worthy of surviving the test of time. With regard to horses, our land is able to cultivate a great many and use them not only for grazing purposes, but for extensive military purposes as well. We'd be foolish to not use our horses as such!"
 iron_currency: "Iron Currency"
 iron_currency_desc: "Regulating our own currency is something prestigous in its own right and we of Hadiya take pride in this. With iron being what our currency is made of, regulating it on our own and making our economy more so dependent on it as opposed to a different nation's currency will help sustain Hadiya as a whole."
 uphold_hadiya_fertility: "Hadiya Fertility"
 uphold_hadiya_fertility_desc: "The lands of Hadiya have continued to be fertile for generations without end and we are forever thankful for this. With this fertility of the land, we must use what we get from it properly by building up our towns and cities as well as our infrastructure from the ground up. Without this foundational element of Hadiya properly built up, our administration and our military will be without enough resources altogether."
 religious_wars_horn_of_africa: "Religious Wars of the Horn"
 religious_wars_horn_of_africa_desc: "The battle between the Cross and the Star-and-Crescent in the Horn of Africa has been around for centuries now and there is no clear end in sight. We of Hadiya must raise the banner of Islam against the likes of Ethiopia and its cadre of subject states so that there can be peace in the region. And even after there is peace in the Horn, Hadiya must carry the legacy forth and toward other ends of Africa and beyond."
 question_of_the_oromo: "Question of the Oromo"
 question_of_the_oromo_desc: "The Oromo migrations have caused a great amount of turmoil in our region but we are not so opposed to them as our neighbors to the west have been. True, the Oromo have caused tension with the Hadiya people, but they are not without their advantages if they can be negotiated with properly and integrated into a wider society as a whole."
 adal_connections: "Adal Connections"
 adal_connections_desc: "The Sultanate of Adal may not be the most friendly power to Hadiya, but they are of Sunni Islam and have pledged to help our people at times against the likes of Ethiopia itself. We can and should use our diplomatic ties inside of Adal to connect to other Islamic nations so that Hadiya is not progressively isolated."
 royal_hadiya_military: "Royal Hadiya Military"
 royal_hadiya_military_desc: "With our military heralding the success of Hadiya in its expansion and defense, formalizing it into something more professional and educating the leaders of the Hadiya military in various strategies not found necessarily in our region will provide us with a strong base for future conquests."

 adal_successor_ideas_bonus: "Adal Successor Ambition"
 after_the_fall_of_adal: "After the Fall of Adal"
 after_the_fall_of_adal_desc: "With the memory of Adal as a political entity withering away in the minds of many, we must pick up where they left off. The sword on the ground, the weapon nearby, and the armor with blood on it, we must pick all of it up and keep up the eternal struggle against the likes of the Christians in the west!"
 steeped_in_islam: "Steeped in Islam"
 steeped_in_islam_desc: "Much like how Ethiopia is drenched in Christianity, the likes of our state are bound up permanently with Islam. With the zeal of Islam that once backed up the Adal Sultanate now backing our cause, we will seek out all places where infidels lay in our land and bring them to the glorious light of Allah! No evil can stay hidden for long, especially in the Horn of Africa!"
 survival_of_the_fittest: "Fight to Survive"
 survival_of_the_fittest_desc: "With the failure of Adal, we are left on our own in the harsh environment of the Horn of Africa. Born into this firey region of constant political struggles and seemingly endless warfare, we must rally our people to the cause of simply keeping our state alive. It's a matter of trying to survive first, then attempting to thrive, but neither are going to come easily for us."
 fighting_the_oromo_migrations: "Oromo Threats"
 fighting_the_oromo_migrations_desc: "The Oromo are a destabilizing force in many states and they don't seem to care much for what harm they cause on the political level. We need to ensure that we have a large enough military to take on not only take on the Oromo migrations but also to take on any attacks from our neighbors."
 integrate_firearms: "Usage of Firearms"
 integrate_firearms_desc: "The usage of firearms was only just being introduced to the Adal Sultanate when it fell which means we can pick up where they left off at. Integrating our military with cannons and firearms and also importing some from neighboring Islamic nations will help us combat the advances from our Christian neighbors."
 quell_the_dynastic_fights: "Quell Dynastic Fights"
 quell_the_dynastic_fights_desc: "If there is one ever-present matter in our nation that was also part of the fall of the Adal Sultanate, it is dynastic disputes. We need to work on a way to solve these matters once and for all so that we do not suffer the same internal illness that the Adal Sultanate did. Imams and Viziers alike can contribute to this deathly fate and thus we will need to deal with them too."
 toward_victory: "Toward Victory!"
 toward_victory_desc: "Adal's fall did not seal our fate away, rather, it let a new force shine through that is capable of picking up where they left off. We do not see the threat of the western Christians as a reason to cower in fear, but rather we see the threat as something to be challenged at all levels! We must and will fight them and seek a victory that for some, seems impossible! Onward, toward victory!"
 BSH_ideas: "Bashkir Ideas"
 BSH_ideas_start: "Bashkir Traditions"
 BSH_ideas_bonus: "Bashkir Ambition"
 from_the_tiele: "From the Tiele"
 from_the_tiele_desc: "The Bashkirs date back to the times of the anciete Tiele, a confederation of nomadic tribes that emerged after the ancient Xiongnu confederation of tribes broke up entirely. With such an ancient lineage, we are able to earn respect and honor amongst our neighbors who also recount stories from so long ago."
 sunni_horde_conquest: "Sunni Conquests"
 sunni_horde_conquest_desc: "Much like our neighbors down south, except for perhaps the Persians, conquest by Sunni states is something that almost comes naturally. Despite sayings of piety and religious doctrine here and there, the steppe know few such laws in reality and the Bashkirs will readily take advantage of both this fact and the legacy of Sunni Muslims conquering great swaths of land in the name of Islam and for themselves."
 holders_for_centuries: "Holders for Centuries"
 holders_for_centuries_desc: "For centuries we have resided where we are, not budging and remaining resolute despite what is thrown at us. Military traditions from our ancestors do not go unknown by any Bashkir fighter or military leader and as such they continue to fight with the same ferocity that our ancestors once did."
 turkic_language_intelligibility: "Turkic Language Intelligibility"
 turkic_language_intelligibility_desc: "Our language is mutually intelligible with several other Turkic languages to a degree, and while we can't understand every single thing our cousins say to us, the fact that we can understand a good amount between us goes a long way toward acceptance and tolerance. The more Turkic kin we come into contact with, the better!"
 bashkir_military_tradition: "Bashkir Military Traditions"
 bashkir_military_tradition_desc: "The militarized mentality of the Bashkirs should not be wasted in the slightest. The zeal with which our people fight when defending the land and when they are among the conquering forces of a different land is unparalleled. We should utilize this zeal for more concrete purposes such as expanding the military sector as a whole and ensuring that it has the best possible chance for success against our enemies."
 traditional_steppe_warfare: "Traditional Steppe Warfare"
 traditional_steppe_warfare_desc: "Despit the introduction of firearms, we still prefer the old ways of cavalry armies and tactics. Bashkirs know just how devastating a cavalry charge along with ranged cavalry tactics can be, especially on the wide open steppe, which is why we still utilize them to this day. In any flat terrain setting, our forces will be sure to have the edge against our foes."
 a_formal_bashkir_military: "Formalize the Fighting Force"
 a_formal_bashkir_military_desc: "With such a strong and grand military foundation, the logical next step is to formalize and standardize the Bashkirs into a fully capable fighting force on par with our neighbors. They may think the Bashkirs can't field that large of an army from the lands of the steppe, but we will prove them wrong."
 AST_ideas: "Astrakhani Ideas"

 AST_ideas_bonus: "Astrakhani Ambition"
 against_the_golden_horde: "Against the Golden Horde"
 against_the_golden_horde_desc: "Breaking away from the Golden Horde and its remnant state, the Great Horde, is no small feat. It takes courage and strength to renounce the old ways of leadership and to begin forging a new path on our own, but with this strength in our hearts and minds, the soldiers and civilians of Astrakhan will go forth and paint a new and brighter future for the region soon enough."
 intersection_of_trade_routes: "Intersection of Trade Routes"
 intersection_of_trade_routes_desc: "The many trade routes that come from all directions intersect at the end of the Volga River as it flows into the Caspian Sea. Our land is one of opportunity and mercantile matters just as much as military affairs and we would be foolish to not capitalize on both. The latter, however, is inherent within Astrakhan, but capitalizing on trade? That is something we will certainly need to work on as time goes by."
 structured_feudal_ranks: "Structured Feudal Ranks"
 structured_feudal_ranks_desc: "Unlike some other khanates, Astrakhan has an ordered and structured social hierarchy that is maintained internally, not by some overlord nation from afar. With this in mind, we can and should integrate new people into this system as time goes on so that they are productive in our land, rather than wandering beggars."
 a_volatile_region: "Our Volatile Region"
 a_volatile_region_desc: "Though there is great opportunity in our region, there is also a great amount of warfare present within it and the successor states to the Golden Horde know this all too well. We of Astrakhan are keen on seeing this period of conflict through to the end despite what our past series of wars and conflicts have indicated; there must be peace and prosperity and our military will fight for this goal without end."
 placate_the_nogais: "Placate the Nogai"
 placate_the_nogais_desc: "A sizable portion of our population are not just Astrakhani, but rather related kin of ours called the Nogai. Though we are family, that does not mean there are not familial tensions between us and often times this has broken out into revolts against our authority in the past. In the future, we need to work on placating and cooperating with our Nogai brothers and sisters instead of forcing them into one single path; cooperation with them can and most likely will lead to more internal stability both in the military and in civilian life."
 become_a_bastion_for_islam: "Becoming an Islamic Bastion"
 become_a_bastion_for_islam_desc: "Islam has its roots far to our south and has reached to the Volga River via conquest and voluntary conversions, but to the north are Christians intent on converting Islamic communities at any cost. As we are the forefront of Islam's spread northward we should strive to become a bastion of the faith and build up our capital to be a center of Islamic learning and culture. If we can do this over time, we will see a rise in faithful adherents coming to our land to aid us in our many endeavors."
 succeed_the_old_khans: "Succeed the Old Khans"
 succeed_the_old_khans_desc: "The ways of the old khans, those of the Golden Horde, the Ilkhanate, the Chagatai Khanate, and the Yuan Dynasty, are gone. No longer can we rely on their traditions of the past to guide us into the dense fog of the future; instead, we must rely on our own skills, abilities, and intuition, making a new path for our leaders and officials. Let out people no longer walk the path of our ancestors, for that path has ended. Now begins the new path, that of Astrakhan."
 QAS_ideas: "Qasimi Ideas"
 QAS_ideas_start: "Qasimi Traditions"
 QAS_ideas_bonus: "Qasimi Ambition"
 muscovite_influences: "Muscovite Influences"
 muscovite_influences_desc: "The influences from our north have seeped into the everyday lives of Qasimi people. Though they are firmly Tatar in culture and ethnicity, ways of governing and administrating the land have become somewhat 'Russified' and as such are taking on a mixed form. This has the result of making politics somewhat easier to handle and it is also resulting in a more flexible administration which is something Qasim will undoubtedly need in the future."
 ryazan_memories: "Ryazani Memories"
 ryazan_memories_desc: "The Principality of Ryazan once held the land we now hold as our own, but the memories of them still hold weight with us. A distinctly non-Russian yet simultaneously somewhat Russian state at the edge of what has traditionally seen as the lands of the Rus, that is what Qasim now holds itself as... For now, at least."
 avenues_for_expansion: "Avenues for Expansion"
 avenues_for_expansion_desc: "When swept away of political boundaries on maps, the land we are situated has few natural borders aside from rivers; mostly flat land for roaming and grazing is what Qasim is used to seeing. As such, this land can easily be conquered on paper, that is. Actually doing so is another matter entirely and we will need extensive measures in the Qasimi administration to afford these conquered lands. With the partially Russified and flexible administration we have, it should not be that large of an endeavor."
 kazan_rivalry: "The Kazan Rivalry"
 kazan_rivalry_desc: "The Kazan Khanate is the one that is perhaps our greatest rival, or has been in the past. Strong in leadership and military skill, they have proven time and time again that Qasim needs to rebuff and strengthen its military whenever possible. It, the Qasimi military, must learn and revise old tactics and strategies used by the ancestors of the past and be ready to integrate newer military practices whenever possible."
 lands_of_a_buffer_state: "Lands of a Buffer State"
 lands_of_a_buffer_state_desc: "Similar to how Ryazan was a sort of buffer state between the khans of the south and the lands of the Rus to the north, Qasim is put into a somewhat similar position. Though the lands may be that of a buffer state in the eyes of neighboring powers, these are the lands by which the Qasimi call home and will defend to the very end. This has diplomatic benefits too as neighboring states may be inclined to gain influence over these 'buffer lands', but we will be sure to not let them diplomatically subjugate us."
 reformed_administrative_leadership: "Reformed Administrative Leadership"
 reformed_administrative_leadership_desc: "With our administration coming along nicely and the Qasimi realm becoming a more potent force in the field of diplomacy and on the field of battle, we should be inclined toward reforming the central administration itself into a more robust and meritocratic system. Noble blood has its place within Qasim, but we cannot deny that education and skills in specific areas are making for outstanding individuals in Qasim, some of whom could certainly benefit the state as a whole if we were to hire them."
 defend_tatar_statehood: "Defend Tatar Statehood"
 defend_tatar_statehood_desc: "As we have threats from all directions still, a Tatar state is becoming a real idea in the minds of many in Qasim, but in the minds of some our neighbors? It is a foul thought that should be stamped out at once! Constantly under threat of military invasion of political intervention, the Qasimi people need to stand tall against these threats and show discipline in the face of abhorrent evil! Statehood will be achieved for Qasim and the Tatar people and there will be a valiant defense of it no matter what!"

 barbary_influences: "Barbary Influences"
 barbary_influences_desc: "The corsairs of the North African coast are renowned for their ruthless nature and their raids on Christian coasts and our coast has some of the best spots for them. The influence they hold in Tripoli is strong and we should be looking to cooperate with them so that we can steer trade income more toward us as opposed to elsewhere."
 control_over_inner_tribes: "Control the Inner Tribes"
 control_over_inner_tribes_desc: "Tripoli is known for its coast, not its inland part, for good reason. The coastal cities are lucrative for trade and havens for corsairs whilst the inner desert sands are home to roaming tribes of Berbers that are quite hard to control. This has to change with future times, however, as we can't continue to allow the tribes to roam and cause havoc on trade and internal connections throughout Tripoli. Utilizing them and making diplomatic deals with them so that we can slowly integrate them into the Tripolitanian state will help ensure that we can stay afloat in terms of reserve forces."
 tripolitanian_trade_measures: "Tripolitanian Trade Measures"
 tripolitanian_trade_measures_desc: "The trade along our coasts is lucrative, but dangerous for many, which is just how we like things. By taking greater control of trade measures and markets around us, we can start exerting more force on our neighbors and funneling trade into where we want it most. A few bloodied coins is fine, so long as the end profit comes to us."
 commanding_the_southern_med: "Commanding the Southern Mediterannean"
 commanding_the_southern_med_desc: "The Southern Mediterannean is rife with corsairs but not all of them are our own. We must begin to consolidate power over the coastal bases and promote our navy throughout the entirety of the Southern Mediterannean without mercy and without leniency so that we are ready for any threat out on the water."
 diplomatic_intrigue: "Diplomatic Intrigue"
 diplomatic_intrigue_desc: "The extension of Tripolitanian power outward toward other regions is known by many and as such diplomatic measures are being made toward us actively. We need to ensure that we can diplomatically manuever ourselves around the international stage well enough so that our rivals are not able to gain influence against us whilst our allies are seeing only the best side of us. Tripoli is a valuable place for many, who in the Mediterannean wouldn't be interested in it?"
 vie_for_naval_supremacy: "The Fight for Naval Supremacy"
 vie_for_naval_supremacy_desc: "The constant fight for dominance on the open water gives the navy of Tripoli consistent experience in combat, meaning that they are adept at fighting at both range and up close during naval encounters. Some of our top admirals are even keen on capturing enemy ships so that they can be repaired and used in the main Tripolitanian fleet later on, a strategy that may just come in handy sooner rather than later."
 construct_naval_bases: "Construct Naval Bases"
 construct_naval_bases_desc: "The entrances into Tripolitanian land that aren't harsh desert or small coastal villages are the main ports where trade funnels into. These are often times vulnerable to enemy ships firing on them or from invasion inland which, in both cases, puts the very life of Tripoli itself in danger. The answer? Naval bases and fortifications so that we can defend our fleets during repairs, construct ships at a faster rate, and also defend ourselves in a much more organized manner."

 monsoon_trade_complex: "Monsoon Marketplace"
 monsoon_trade_complex_desc: "We of Sofala are part of the great Monsoon Marketplace, to put it informally, and just as we contribute to it through trade we also receive from it via revenue. Continuing this bountiful exchange of people, goods, services, and materials will serve to cement Sofala's position as a key port for many around East Africa."
 positive_kilwa_influences: "Kilwa's Good Side"
 positive_kilwa_influences_desc: "Kilwa's attempts to influence Sofala and its people was not purely bad since we learned a lot in regards to boats, how they are built, and what uses they have for the rivers we surround. By keeping this knowledge in use at the docks and harbors of Sofala, we'll continue to have strong and combat-ready vessels fit for the protection of Sofalan waters."
 swahili_and_mutapan_population: "Swahili and Mutapan People"
 swahili_and_mutapan_population_desc: "The two main people in our land are the Swahili and the Mutapan people, both of which are crucial to everyday matters from administration to diplomatic affairs. If we can manipulate both people groups effectively within Sofala, we can use the connections they have in foreign nations around us to gain positive influence elsewhere."
 vying_for_independent_control: "Sofala's Struggle"
 vying_for_independent_control_desc: "Kilwa has had interests in Sofala for a long while, as have the Mutapan leaders further upstream from where Sofala's capital is. This constant struggle to maintain an independent state free from the overbearing influence of Kilwan or Mutapan lords has led our people to looking to us for legitimacy since we our struggle so far as been met with success."
 promote_harbor_building: "Harbor Infrastructure"
 promote_harbor_building_desc: "Without our harbors, we are nothing as a state. They are the entry and exit point into Sofala for a great many people and will need to be kept in the best shape possible for future endeavors, whether they are mercantile in nature or for military purposes since ships of the Sofalan navy are also docked inside these harbors."
 renovate_production_infrastructure: "Production Refinement"
 renovate_production_infrastructure_desc: "The productive potential of Sofala is not to be underestimated. Our capital of Sofala was founded purely because of how lucrative resource extraction was from the location and even to this day it is the site of a great amount of resource extraction. Refining our production methods is the only natural choice for us now so that we can keep this up."
 seaport_of_the_south: "The Great Southern Seaport"
 seaport_of_the_south_desc: "With our power almost unrestricted and our infrastructure both inland and by the coast growing at a healthy rate, trade revenue should become the direct focus of Sofala in the future. Increasing the efforts we put into maximizing trade profits and advantageous trade deals is what will grant Sofala success and prosperity in the future."

 generals_with_the_hosokawa_desc: "The Hosokawa clan has used members of the Akamatsu Clan for various military affairs in the past. While we are on our own now with our own land to deal with, the experience that our prominent members have brought back from their time with the Hosokawa clan has and will continue to give us valuable insight into warfare as a whole."
 integrated_with_the_ashikaga_shogunate: "Integrated with the Ashikaga Shogunate"
 integrated_with_the_ashikaga_shogunate_desc: "Our origins lie with Akamatsu Norimura, the valued support of Emperor Go-Daigo and the founder of the Ashikaga Shogunate, Ashikaga Takauji. With this in mind, the Akamatsu Clan has been a key supporter of the Ashikaga Shogunate ever since and has been integrated well within the politics within Kyoto itself. Keeping this political participation going will only garner the Akamatsu Clan more prosperity as time goes on."
 constructor_of_himeji_castle: "Builder of Himeji Castle"
 constructor_of_himeji_castle_desc: "Himeji Castle, glorious and grand as it is, had its foundation laid by Akamatsu Norimura in 1333. Though his fortification was torn down and rebuilt as Himeyama Castle in 1346, the legacy of being the founder of Himeji Castle's foundation still runs through the Akamatsu Clan. Such marvelous fortifications that can house a great many defenders will be a hallmark of our clan."
 shinmen_clan_swordsmen: "Swordsmen of the Shinmen Clan"
 shinmen_clan_swordsmen_desc: "The Shinmen Clan is a branch of the Akamatsu Clan and a valuable one at that. They have a keen eye for finding and hiring the finest swordsmen in the land, warriors more disciplined and skilled than any others. We should work on fostering a healthy relationship with the Shinmen members so that we can utilize the fine warriors they recruit."
 patronize_the_five_mountains_literature: "Patronize Five Mountains Literature"
 patronize_the_five_mountains_literature_desc: "Akamatsu Norimura and indeed the rest of the Akamatsu Clan have been great patrons of the Buddhist sect that Sesson Yubai belonged to. Yubai himself being a Zen Buddhist monk, he is often regarded the first important poet of the Five Mountains; the Five Mountains being considered literature produced by the principal Zen monastic centers of Yubai's sect, Rinzai. As we go forth, we would be wise to follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and continue patronizing the literature of the Five Mountains whether it be for spreading the teachings or for promoting the Rinzai sect."
 support_the_rinzai_school: "Support the Rinzai School"
 support_the_rinzai_school_desc: "The Rinzai School has its roots in Japan in 1168 with Myoan Eisai. After his initial efforts and after the work of those like Nanpo Shomyo, Sesson Yubai, Shuho Myocho, and Muso Soseki (the latter two did not travel back to China at all to study, giving the school a truly Japanese flavor) the Rinzai School of Zen Buddhism became favored by both the samurai class and by the powers in Kyoto because it actively supported the shogun himself. The Akamatsu Clan being one of the great patrons of the school itself will have an edge in politics and military affairs because of them."
 succeed_the_minamoto_clan: "Succeed the Minamoto Clan"
 succeed_the_minamoto_clan_desc: "The Heian Period is long gone and so is the influence of the four great clans that dominated politics during that period: the Fujiwara, the Taira, the Tachibana, and the Minamoto Clan. The Akamatsu Clan being a descedant of the Minamoto Clan gives it a clear sense of power and prominence elsewhere throughout Japan and even in Kyoto itself. This is power that cannot simply be bought or taken by the cut of a sword or firing of a musket, no, this is power that can only be had by being of the correct blood and family."

 general_and_captain_experience: "Outside Experience"
 general_and_captain_experience_desc: "Maeda Clan members have been seen in several armies around Japan. Many daimyo incorporate our members so that they can succeed in battle, yet these battles serve to also strengthen the Maeda Clan itself. The tactics and strategies used in these battles will be sorted through by Maeda Clan officers so that they can be refined and used for our own uses later on."
 contention_with_ikko_ikki: "Contention with the Ikko-Ikki"
 contention_with_ikko_ikki_desc: "Disruptions by the Ikko-Ikki are abound in the lands of several daimyo and they are invoking military conflicts between peasant and noble populations. The Maeda Clan is no stranger to this either and we must be prepared for any sudden happenings, whether they be riots by the Ikko-Ikki or conflicts between social classes that we need to rectify. Our troops must always be ready for whatever comes their way."
 in_the_heart_of_the_sengoku: "Heart of the Sengoku Jidai"
 in_the_heart_of_the_sengoku_desc: "Being at the center or near center of conflicts during the Sengoku Jidai has led to the Maeda Clan becoming more militaristic and adept at warfare in a variety of settings. Let nothing stand in the way of us when the banners of war fly high! Let the fires of war scorch the land and leave nothing by the Maeda Clan standing at the end of it all! Only the strongest and greatest of the daimyo in Japan will survive to the end and we are set on making sure that is us!"
 settle_the_o_le_so_do_disputes: "Settle the 'House Strife'"
 settle_the_o_le_so_do_disputes_desc: "Because of how political matters work within our realm, the Maeda Clan as well as many others are beset by O-le Sodo, or, house strife. Typically identified as disputes between noble families these conflicts can often lead to the destruction of important relationships between members of the Maeda Clan and also others outside the Maeda Clan. We need to work on a system to sort out and effectively work through these noble disputes before they can escalate into civil disturbances that grind our administration to a halt."
 establish_kanazawa: "Kanazawa Headquarters"
 establish_kanazawa_desc: "The establishment of Kanazawa as the center of the Maeda Clan is crucial. Instead of moving from place to place and moving politics wherever our political leaders are, we can have a stationary set of buildings that all Maeda Clan members report to at some point. Administration can be done more easily through this system rather than through a somewhat migratory system."
 ordered_cadet_branches: "Strictly Ordered Cadet Branches"
 ordered_cadet_branches_desc: "The cadet branches of the Maeda Clan must not be given too much autonomy. We must enforce strict loyalty amongst the members of these inferior lines and use them strategically so that our enemies are not able to manipulate them in a way that is detrimental to us."
 kanazawa_castle: "Kanazawa Castle"
 kanazawa_castle_desc: "The completion of Kanazawa for administrative purposes would be the building of a proper castle. Kanazawa castle will serve to mark the power and prestige of the Maeda Clan as well as improve the defensive mentality within Maeda ranks. Plus, all the other clans have castles to call their own, why can't we have one?"

 descedants_of_seiwa_genji_desc: "Like many other daimyo around Japan and even those of the Ashikaga Shogunate, we are descedants of the Seiwa Genji line which dates back to the Emperor Seiwa and is perhaps the most powerful out of the Minamoto lines. We should use this noble blood within our rulers to display not only prestige but also to gain influence when and where we can, especially in Kyoto."
 life_of_ikeda_sen: "Ikeda Sen"
 life_of_ikeda_sen_desc: "The life of Ikeda Sen is quite remarkable and something of a blessing to the Ikeda Clan. Trained in martial arts and the leader of a unit of 200 female muskteers, Ikeda Sen went forth a was prominent volunteer for various clans around Japan before coming back to serve under the Ikeda Clan itself. She even held land in her own right and received a few fiefdoms as a result of her work and dealings. We would be fools to let her example pass by into the annals of history, no, instead we will take her example with pride strengthen the Ikeda Clan as much as possible through her legacy."
 keepers_of_castles: "Keepers of Castles"
 keepers_of_castles_desc: "Various parts of the Ikeda Clan are in charge of a great many castles and fortifications around Japan itself. The service and maintenance of these fortifications are often overlooked by others but not those of the Ikeda Clan. We will use what knowledge we have of castle upkeep and ensure that our own fortifications are maintained properly and with the utmost prudence."

 political_maneuvers_around_kyoto_desc: "By fighting loyally for certain daimyo, exacting revenge in certain places, bribing officials, marrying off family relatives, and even seizing land for ourselves, the Ikeda Clan is no strange to politics in Japan. Using the skills the members of the Ikeda Clan have in terms of both normal and shady diplomacy will bolster our work both in the short and long term."
 reconnect_the_ikeda_domains: "Reconnecting Ikeda Domains"
 reconnect_the_ikeda_domains_desc: "Previously, our domains were divided by both various daimyo and geographic details. Now that we are becoming an ever-stronger presence throughout Japan itself, we can finally connect these scattered domains into one solid, contiguous state without interruption. From here, we will be able to project much more power than before."
 shogun_of_western_japan: "'Saigoku no Shogun'"
 shogun_of_western_japan_desc: "With such power coming to us, some are now calling our leader the 'saigoku no shogun' or, Shogun of Western Japan. This is laughable to others outside our domain, but we are not taking this title lightly. Instead, the Ikeda Clan needs to capitalize on it and move to continue building up its power. The title of being the Shogun of Western Japan will help incorporate new people into our domain as few can even challenge our authority as it is."
 seizure_of_power: "Seizure of Power"
 seizure_of_power_desc: "The ultimate authority in the land must and will be the Ikeda Clan. The Ashikaga Clan overthrew the Kamakura Shogunate and established themselves as the holders of Japan, now the time must come for the Ashikaga Shogunate to be humbled. Let their weak power be swept aside as the true wielders of power and might, the Ikeda, ascend to the forefront of politics, diplomacy, and military matters."

Though we do not carry the name 'Malacca', our spirit is that of our ancestor and will remain that way as we go forth in righteous glory."
 methodical_order_of_succession: "Methodical Order of Succession"
 methodical_order_of_succession_desc: "The method by which the heir is chosen and ascends to the throne is often times too complex or dragged into the mud by intrigue and corrupt ties. We need to make a refined system of titles and positions of succession so that we can know who is doing what in the royal family and what the order of heirs are for Perak's throne without question."
 improve_court_meritocracy: "Improve Court Meritocracy"
 improve_court_meritocracy_desc: "Where previously we may have relied on noble blood to fill our court with advisors and courtiers, we are rapidly moving into an age where merit and skill is valued over simple status and dynastic relation. Perak needs to adjust itself internally from the top down to form a more merit-based court that can promote new ideas and innovation whilst also attracting great scholars from around the region."

 struggles_for_unification_desc: "The Malay Peninsula has been divided ever since the Sultanate of Malacca came tumbling down; now we are one of the successors left to pick up the pieces that are scattered around. Whether by diplomatic subjugation or simple conquest, we need to bring the entirety of the peninsula under our control before external powers begin invading. The claims are already set, we just simply need to strike at the correct time."

 sailors_of_the_strait_desc: "The valuable strait has given life to many states in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Java. We of Perak are natural sailors and protectors of the strait itself, meaning that we can and should be getting the most out of it compared to our allies and rivals."

 control_trade_flow_desc: "Subjugating the trade of the strait is crucial and once we have that done, we will be able to direct a great amount of trade from the north and south. It will make us a grand power the likes of which our ancestors of the Malacca Sultanate would be proud of."

Instead, Johor will be taking the initiative and make moves against the enemy first before they can get going with troop movements."
 militarize_the_land: "Militarize the Peninsula"
 militarize_the_land_desc: "The Malay Peninsula is suitable for trade and naval bases, but the inland areas are relatively hard to cultivate for military purposes and actual thriving cities and towns. We must slowly change this as time goes on and build up a land force (with infrastructure like barracks and training camps included) that is just as capable as our navy is."
 friends_in_sumatra_java: "Nusantara Friends"
 friends_in_sumatra_java_desc: "The wide array of islands and states on various islands around South East Asia make for ample opportunities to make friends diplomatically. We need to keep our options open and our diplomats ready so that we can cultivate new friendships against common enemies, especially ones that would see Johor cut down."
 reestablish_trade_hegemony: "The Next Monopoly"
 reestablish_trade_hegemony_desc: "Where once the Sultanate of Malacca almost held a monopoly on trade through the strait, we are now tasked with succeeding in. It will not be an easy task, but with a strong military and navy to support expeditions for Johor on Sumatra, Java, and even north of the Malay Peninsula, few will be able to stop the rising power of Johor."

It is our duty to cut down these petty warlords and to assert rightful dominance over both small villages and large towns alike so that our path to reunification is firm and whole."
 near_the_heart_of_power: "Near the Heart of Power"
 near_the_heart_of_power_desc: "We of Tonkin are near the heart of where Vietnamese power has been for generations: Dong Kinh. Consolidating power here and asserting our authority in these lands of the north will grant us more formalized resources from Chinese towns and cities north and northeast of Dong Kinh. With such resources at our disposal, we will be ready to launch campaign after campaign for our rightful lands."
 masters_of_the_tropics: "Masters of the Tropics"
 masters_of_the_tropics_desc: "The harsh terrain that we call home is on the east side of the Annamite Range. While we have open access to the water for trade and sailing, not far from the coast is lush, dense forest and jungle that is hard to traverse by most foreigners. It is this natural defensive barrier that we will use to our advantage when they come into our land; they will face ambushes frequently and fierce resistance with every village and town they come across, their time here will make them regret ever arriving!"
 peace_with_our_neighbors: "Make Peace; Make Friends"
 peace_with_our_neighbors_desc: "Because of our position in the north, we are able to maintain good relations and good standing with mutliple powers. Tonkin's respect grows not only with time and fostering good relations with neighboring states, but also throughout controlling and making Dong Kinh itself prosper."
 turn_away_the_christian_cross: "Turn Away Foreign Faiths"
 turn_away_the_christian_cross_desc: "People with faiths foreign to our lands, people with strange crosses and talks of this 'Jesus' figure, they do not belong in our land. For too long with have toiled with Buddhist, Confucian, and Hindu relations in our own land and these alone are proving to be a somewhat difficult to handle. These 'christians' are only going to be more a threat to Vietnamese society as a whole!"
 purchase_new_weapons: "Coin for Weapons"
 purchase_new_weapons_desc: "We don't have the manufacturing potential like the Chinese do for things such as firearms and cannons, but we do have money and money goes a long way in Vietnamese land and in just about every place around us. We can easily purchase new weapons for our military and cut out the process of making the weapons as a whole, the only thing we need to do is properly train our military to use such weapons."

 reunite_the_vietnamese_people_desc: "What are the Vietnamese if they are divided into two pieces, three pieces, or even more? Weak, vulnerable, ready to be conquered by foreign invaders like the Chinese or ready to be raided to no end by the Cham people. All of our effort must go into reunifying the land and after that, ensuring that no dynasty, no state, and no political entity is ever a threat to the stability of the Vietnamese people."

Our neighbors see us as a possible threat and that is a good thing, but we should not be opposed to making at least temporary alliances with our neighbors since we will need support in reclaiming not only the lands of the Vietnamese."
 producing_cannons: "Producing Cannons"
 producing_cannons_desc: "Cannon making isn't the most feasible thing to do in Vietnamese land but it is done on occasion as it is. There is an option for improving our production of cannons, however, and that requires getting outside help so that we can use new designs and refinement techniques. Engaging in this transfer of information and improving our artillery sector will only serve to help cement our dominance over the traditional lands of the Vietnamese and beyond."
 taking_after_the_chinese: "Taking after the Chinese"
 taking_after_the_chinese_desc: "Though many Vietnamese people and families resent the Chinese for their invasions of our land in the past, we cannot deny that their influence upon our people has helped shaped us into who we are today. Even today we can see their military forces being more organized and well trained than our own; why don't we try to emulate this and begin doing as they do just a little bit more? Import Chinese clothing, use some of the strategies in the Chinese military, centralize matters and ensure that we can effectively command our own troops at all times."

 rajput_divisions_in_cutch: "Rajput Divisions Internally"
 rajput_divisions_in_cutch_desc: "The Rajputs tribes and clans that have come to the Gujarati region are entrenched and crucial to politics, military matters, and even diplomatic affairs. Kutch, however, is a victim of their rather consistent in-fighting and feuds that result in a great amount of strain on the administration. We need to work to control these internal divisions and help workout solutions for the various clans so that they can cooperate and unite under one banner instead of fighting each other."
 curb_tribal_politics_in_cutch: "Curbing Tribal Politics"
 curb_tribal_politics_in_cutch_desc: "To transcend tribal politics is marvelous, but getting there is an entirely different story. Whether it is by strict treatment or peaceful negotiations, we need to ensure that the word of the Kutchi administration comes before the word of chiefs and clan leaders, ensuring a strong path to proper governance from a central authority."

 the_dwarkadhish_temple_of_gujarat_desc: "Dwarka (the city) and its temple of Dwarkadhish is part of Sapta Puri, the seven holy pilgrimage sites in the lands of the subcontinent. Every year Hindus from all walks of life travel to here to pay homage to their faith, meaning that protecting it is of the utmost importance for us. Doing so will not only grant us a good name amongst Hindu communities elsewhere, but it will also help show how devoted we are to the people of our land."
 fortifications_against_raids: "Fortifications against Raids"
 fortifications_against_raids_desc: "Raids from the north are common enough to warrant special attention from the Kutchi administration. For too long we have suffered at the hands of the Sindhi people at the mouth of the Indus River, we must not let their raids beat our people down forever. By expanding our curent and future fortifications with extra garrisons and more effective construction techniques, we can put up a much stronger fight against these fiends."
 patrons_of_ashapura_mata: "Patrons of Ashapura Mata"
 patrons_of_ashapura_mata_desc: "She is the principle deity of our land, the land of Kutch and all of the Gujarati region surrounding it. Ashapura Mata (sometimes known as Kuldevi) is the one we must pay special attention to and whose temples we must be the largest patrons of. Doing so will earn us good favor with our own people both of high and low status, for most if not all the people of Kutch and Gujarat uphold the rulers who put their trust in the goddess who fulfills wishes and desires."
 ceramic_and_glass_interests: "Ceramic and Glass Interests"
 ceramic_and_glass_interests_desc: "As of late, there has been an increased interest in the likes of the upper class of Kutch in regards to making glass of various types and also ceramics. While some are skeptical as to how profitable such endeavors would be in our land, we can easily see that in the coming decades, such products will be highly sought after. We would do well to capitalize on this glass and ceramic idea now before it is too late."
 maritime_ambitions: "Maritime Ambitions of Kutch"
 maritime_ambitions_desc: "The last avenue many see for Kutch is the aspect of maritime trade and connections. Reaching out and connecting with the various lucrative trade ports and helping improve the mercantile sector of our own state should be a priority since in the past we have barely profited at all in this respect."

We of Junagadh have not had luck in fighting them off and as such have served as their subject in the past. Though this isn't ideal, it has allowed us to become flexible and capable in terms of negotiations and diplomacy, something that few others in our home region know how to do properly."
 descendants_of_yadu: "Descendants of the Yadu Tribe"
 descendants_of_yadu_desc: "The Yadu Tribe is the descendant of Yadu himself, whom is mentioned in the Mahabharata, the Harivamsha, and the Puranas.

 age_old_conflicts_desc: "From centuries ago we have had conflict on our borders. For so long we have fought against the Chaulukya kings of Gujarat and though they may be gone, new conflicts sparked as soon as the Muslims made their way to power. We must never let our guard down against new foes that come to our border; Junagadh is never quite safe from enemy incursions."
 junagadh_coins: "Junagadh Coinage"
 junagadh_coins_desc: "Copper coins are common place in Junagadh and we are slowly incorporating other types of coins from surrounding areas into our own. We need to ensure that the supply and demand of our coins is in a constant balance and also that new coins are minted for each and every new ruler that rises to power. It will take some time to refine our system to this standard, but it will be worth it in the end."

 uparkot_fort_and_junagadh_desc: "The fortresses and stepwells built in Junagadh are good enough as it is, but we should not be content with pure functionality.

That does not deter us, however, and our ambitions still lie in the destruction of the power those fiendish sultans have and uniting our home region under one authority. If this takes years or decades to happen, then so be it."
 pirates_of_gujarat: "Pirates of Gujarat"
 pirates_of_gujarat_desc: "In order to weaken the power of the Gujarat sultans, our previous leaders attempted to perform piracy against them in and around the Gulf of Khambhat. Though some see piracy as a petty measure that won't get very far, we are convinced that it can and will help force other nations around us into submission or at the very least to the negotiating table."
 descendant_states: "Descendant States"
 descendant_states_desc: "Many members of the Gohil Dynasty have branched off and created small states within our land, uniting more rural communities under themselves and acting as a sort of administrative division for us as a whole. Uniting them under a firm top-down administration that can work effectively and coherently will allow us to draw on the power they have stored up."
 controlling_saurashtra: "Controlling Saurashtra"
 controlling_saurashtra_desc: "The nature of Saurashtra has been divided for a great many years. Few if any have ever united for long and even when they did, it was still rife with communal or tribal feuds that often hindered the productivity of the land itself. Control, then, must not come from outside the region, but rather from inside the region itself, and who better than those of Palitana? Under our guidance, we can ensure a righteous and profitable future for the strategically situated cities through the region."

 money_for_life_desc: "Palitana can focus on the lucrative side of things once the politics of Saurashtra are sorted. Ensuring that monetary practices are flowing smoothly, that trade is without hinderance, and that our production methods are being consistently refined will help attract foreign investors and traders.

Pretender states may have taken these cities for themselves for now, but they will not last long."

It will be through discipline and martial prowess as that is what made us crumble into pieces so long ago.

This did not last, however, and we are more than capable of rising from the ashes they spread on our land. From these age-old conflicts into the future, we will see to it that the Oyo people rise once again and do not fall from grace."
 armored_cavalry_warfare: "Armored Cavalry"
 armored_cavalry_warfare_desc: "What is different about our cavalry compared to those of the Nupe or the Dahomey is that we choose to use armor for our horses. This helps them survive in battle for longer periods of time and often times it can help turn the tide of battles altogether. Utilizing armor on our swift cavalry into the future will only help us subjugate those who dare stand against us."
 reformation_of_oyo_ranks: "Reformation of the Oyo Ranks"
 reformation_of_oyo_ranks_desc: "Learning from the defeat the Nupe inflicted on us was not easy. Disputes were had and several changes had to be made to our administration and military sectors, but in the end it was all worth it, was it not? Our discipline is a cut above the Nupe and the Dahomey and many others and it is all thanks to the blood we shed in the past and what we learned from it all."

 grand_political_structure_desc: "Our land is not a hereditary monarchy, nor is it an absolute one at that. Our heir is chosen by the Oyo Mesi which in it of itself is a council comprised of seven prinipal figures. This council is an electoral one at that and is led by the Bashorun (essentially the Prime Minister) and each of the seven position in the Oyo Mesi represent the various interests of the Oyo Empire itself.

To this day we are still dealing with intermittent fallout from this breaking away and it has given way to a variety of tensions between Muslim and Hindu communities, but we must not capitulate to these minor factors. Cirebon must overcome these challenges and secure itself against powers who want to exploit this tension."

Key to our foundation as it is, we shall not stop in our efforts to spread Islam into the various places that Cirebon takes interest in. Whether it is by soldiers of our state or merchants from our coasts, Islam must flow outward from the bastion that is Cirebon."

Stretching from Java to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra and even parts of Borneo, it has truly left an impression upon all states that succeeded it.

 campaigns_in_sumatra_desc: "To our north lay the tough and ruthless states that succeeded Srivijaya and the Majapahit Empire. Let us take to the high seas and narrow straits where many fates will be decided, for the successor states will have no mercy on us when the campaigns for trade hegemony begin."
 contesting_spice_trade_control: "Contest for the Spice Trade"
 contesting_spice_trade_control_desc: "The spice trade is lucrative to all in Nusantara and all still strive to claim it entirely, but few have the capability to make their ambition a reality. Do we of Demak have the capability? A laughable question since of course we do! We just need to prove ourselves to those who would dare question our authority."
 thalassocracy_from_java: "Thalassocracy from Java"
 thalassocracy_from_java_desc: "Keeping control of the spice trade means keeping naval control of the trade routes that go into and out of Nusantara. It isn't easy maintaining such a hefty fleet of ships, but Demak and its people are by now used to being a naval power. Let none stand in our way when it comes to keeping the waters safe and lucrative."
 modern_trade_competition: "Modern Trade Competition"
 modern_trade_competition_desc: "As the world continues to change, Demak must change along wit hit. Trade resources as well as the ways of trading as a whole are moving and shifting without end, meaning that Demak has to learn to adapt and modernize its efforts as time goes on."

 destroyers_of_the_pajang_kingdom: "Destroyers of the Pajang Kingdom"
 destroyers_of_the_pajang_kingdom_desc: "The Pajang Kingdom came before us and they were not fit to hold the seat of power in Java. Vulnerable to civil conflicts and political disputes, we of Mataram rose up from the splits in their political structure and founded a new state, one that can effectively rule Java unlike any other."
 to_subjugate_java: "Subjugating Java"
 to_subjugate_java_desc: "Java itself is a land of great riches, but Mataram's inland home is not ripe for taking hold of the edges of the grand island. Our slow but sure progress on the island will be marked with celebrations and a restructuring of the old societal ways so that they can be revamped into something more suitable for Mataram."
 learning_inland_fighting: "Learning Inland Fighting"
 learning_inland_fighting_desc: "The lands of Java are harsh for making military movements and sieges. They require hefty planning and can often take a larger toll on the military than one might expect. It is because of this that we of Mataram need to learn how to effectively conduct war on Java so that when we invade elsewhere, we can use what we learned before and thus gain an advantage."
 cut_down_unruly_subjects: "Cut Down Internal Threats"
 cut_down_unruly_subjects_desc: "Time and time again, powers on Java have been undermined by the fact that internal politics fluctuate to a great degree. Various marriages, weak authority, and people supporting pretenders to the throne have dealt deathly blows to previous powers on Java, but Mataram will be different! It will seek to tackle these threats before they can get time to flourish!"
 ruling_with_absolute_authority: "Mataram Absolutism"
 ruling_with_absolute_authority_desc: "Unlike our predecessors, we will ensure that our authority is known throughout all of our lands. Java is a land that will chew up and spit out weak states without mercy; Mataram must prove itself worthy to be spared from this fate through thorough administrative reforms and absolute authority from the monarch."
 holy_wars_of_mataram: "Holy Wars of Mataram"
 holy_wars_of_mataram_desc: "Hindus and Christians alike, they seek to claim the lands around us when in fact, they are rightfully belonging to the most powerful state on Java, that being Mataram! They know no discipline or respect for us in the slightest, not even for Islam, and for that they must die!"
 the_imogiri_burial_place: "Imogiri"
 the_imogiri_burial_place_desc: "A place to remember our past rulers, great and small, that is what Imogiri is and forever shall be. No ruler of Mataram will be placed elsewhere and as our lineage continues to grow and prosper, the complex of Imogiri will be expanded steadily. All of our past shall be looked after with care, all of the bad times as well as all of the good times."

 BAN_ideas_bonus: "Banten Ambition"
 black_pepper_trading: "Pepper Trading"
 black_pepper_trading_desc: "A great source of the wealth made in the southern parts of Sumatra and the western parts of Java is the trade in pepper spices. We are renowned for the cultivation and export of peppers of many kinds and it would be foolish of us to not capitalize on this fact. From here, we can start delving into other key resources for trade and profit."
 resist_and_overcome_sunda: "Against Sunda"
 resist_and_overcome_sunda_desc: "The Sunda Kingdom once held influence across a majority of Western Java, but times are changing and their influence is crumbling with each week and month that passes by. We of Banten are no longer bound to the words and decrees of Sunda, instead we will forge a new path for ourselves and eclipse the once mighty Sunda Kingdom. Through blood, iron, pen, and papers, we will take what they once held as their own and make it even better."
 entrepot_for_traders: "Entrepot for Traders"
 entrepot_for_traders_desc: "With our growing influence in Sumatra and Java, it should come as no surprise that we are becoming more and more attractive to traders from very far away. Ensuring that our ports are safe and that our merchants are well educated will make a great amount of difference when we compare our trade power to others on the world stage."
 contention_in_sumatra_and_java: "Tensions in Sumatra and Java"
 contention_in_sumatra_and_java_desc: "The Sunda Kingdom may be a shadow, dying a slow death, but that does not mean peace can be had in Java or Sumatra. Indeed there are states of both Muslim and Hindu adherence that could be a threat to Banten's power, thus requiring us to take power away from them either by diplomacy or by force."
 dealing_with_the_banten_court: "Dealing with our Court"
 dealing_with_the_banten_court_desc: "Much like other states in the islands of Nusantara, Banten must deal with its own set of problems. The court of Banten is where our problems currently are since it is both an attractive and lucrative place. Corrupt connections are rife in certain sectors, meaning we will need to crack down on the corruption and scandals before they can grow to destabilize the entirety of Banten."
 divided_land_to_administrate: "Divide and Administrate"
 divided_land_to_administrate_desc: "The land of Banten is not without its struggles in terms of being able to administrate it. Petty local lords and authorities often seek to gain power in one way or another that is not always the most honest or proper, causing tension amongst various people in our administration. To counter this, we need to be appointing people of our own choosing more often, people who we know can do a good job and who are also loyal to Banten as a whole."
 protectionism_in_force: "Protect and Profit"
 protectionism_in_force_desc: "Like other states in our region have done in the past, we must now turn to the waters to secure our trade. Ship-to-ship warfare is going to only increase as time goes on and the navy of Banten must be ready for whatever hostile fleet comes into its own waters. Heavier and more robust ship designs that can load more cannons overall will certainly be a benefit to us."
 BLM_ideas: "Blambangan Ideas"

 BLM_ideas_bonus:  "Blambangan Ambition"
 alongside_majapahit: "Alongside Majapahit"
 alongside_majapahit_desc: "Our roots lay in the foundations of the Majapahit Empire and its founder, Raden Wijaya, in the late 1290s. Our land was seen as a vassal of sorts to the core of Majapahit and it developed steadily alongside the heart of the once great empire. It is through this development and showing of strength with little in the way of actual help of Majapahit that Blambangan shall thrive; we are in no need of being as subject once more."
 remember_the_paregreg_war: "Memories of the Paregreg War"
 remember_the_paregreg_war_desc: "The Paregreg War of 1404-1406 was a civil war within the Majaphit Empire that was mainly over the rivalry between the courts of Majapahit (Western Court, led by Wikramawardhana) and Blambangan (Eastern Court, led by Bhre Wirabhumi). It shows just how influential and powerful the area of Blambangan had become, and though we lost back then to the Majapahit Empire, the memory of this period in history brings a sense of legitimacy to the administration of Blambangan today."
 lonely_hindu_kingdom: "The Lonley Hindu Kingdom"
 lonely_hindu_kingdom_desc: "With the loss of Majapahit and the decline of the Sunda Kingdom, Blambangan is one of the only Hindu states left on Java. In our lonesome state, we face threats from all directions since they would see the last vestige of the Majapahit Empire taken over and executed out of existence. Let us set up tall walls, defensive positions, and effective strategies to counter these invasive plans so that Blambangan can withstand these threats. We will not fall to what lies beyond our own coast."
 fending_off_foreign_interests: "Fending off Foreigners"
 fending_off_foreign_interests_desc: "The foreign forces that seek to control Java for themselves are seeking to stifle our power and our prosperity in every way possible. Our military must be ready for when our navy cannot hold them back; they must be able to outlast the enemy in battle and win fight after fight for Blambangan when defeat seems likely."
 expel_muslim_insurgents: "Expel the Muslim Insurgents"
 expel_muslim_insurgents_desc: "With the rise of Islam in the west on Sumatra and in the Malay Peninsula, Java seems to be the only bastion of Hinduism left in the main chain of islands. The states to our west are seeking to convert our people and snuff out the lasting legacy of Hinduism in Blambangan, but we shall not let them! We must ensure that our administration is strictly Hindu in most if not all aspects. If this means empowering the Brahmins to help us in this effort, then it is a price we must pay."
 centralize_trading_authority: "Centralizing Trade"
 centralize_trading_authority_desc: "Trade in Java has routinely been decentralized thanks to the internal nature of the island itself. By looking toward new methods of land cultivation and building inland roads as well as renewed infrasture, we can make sure trade is much more centralized and efficient through Blambangan."
 restore_javanese_peace: "Restoration of Java"
 restore_javanese_peace_desc: "For decades now, Java has not known peace. The wars of religion between Hindus and Muslims has caused a great amount of strife alongside conflicts with foreigners from far off shores. In time, when we restore Java to its original state with Hinduism being the prime religion of the land, the prosperity garnered here will be echoed throughout the ages in one unified tone."

They are a signature element of Balinese architecture and design and will continue to be paramount in the spreading of our traditions beyond just our central island."
 links_with_china: "Links with China"
 links_with_china_desc: "In our past, we have historically had intermarriages with people of various Chinese courts. These influential ties may have withered away somewhat since our past, but we can easily rekindle them and ensure that our reputation is bolstered by the fact that the Chinese see us as worthy enough to marry and do business with."
 inheritor_of_majapahit: "Inheritor of Majapahit"
 inheritor_of_majapahit_desc: "As Majapahit fell to internal conflicts and various outside influences, the court steadily moved resources and people over to Bali as it was a much safer place than Blambangan or the western parts of Java. Such a close relationship with Majapahit has resulted in many seeing us as the heir to the empire and its lands, something we should capitalize on as quickly as possible."
 javanese_court_culture: "Javanese Court Culture"
 javanese_court_culture_desc: "Majapahit influence extended not just to the society of Bali, but also to its courtly culture as well. From the details in the palace to the way in which advisors and rulers conducted themselves, much has been learned from Majapahit in the way of statecraft. Bali will undoubtedly benefit from this influence as it continues to strive for greatness."
 royal_libraries_for_manuscripts: "Royal Libraries"
 royal_libraries_for_manuscripts_desc: "Along with courtly culture, Majapahit officials and scholars brought with them various manuscripts that were revered by many. To safely store them, there should be a royal library (more than one, possibly) built so that our ruler and the administrative cadre can read upon the past in a whole and complete manner. In time, as new works are written in the coming years, they will be stored in our royal libraries."
 bastion_of_indojavanese_culture: "Bastion of Javanese Culture"
 bastion_of_indojavanese_culture_desc: "With Islam making its presence more and more known throughout the great islands of our home region, it is only natural the people who are staunchly in support of the original Hindu-Buddhist Javanese culture would fight back or, if they cannot fight back, move elsewhere. Bali has become a new refuge and home for Javanese culture as a result of this slow migration and it is through this recognition of our rising status that we will bring back the grand days of the past, before Islam made its way into our lands."
 restoration_of_the_true_javanese: "Restoration of the Javanese"
 restoration_of_the_true_javanese_desc: "Restoring the likes of the Javanese to their once grand prominence will not be easy. Bali is going to have to sacrifice a great many things in order to see the likes of Majapahit's influence achieved once again, but in the end, we know that it will be worth the effort."

 unify_south_kalimantan_desc: "We hail from the area known as South Kalimantan. Though Hindu kingdoms have come before us in the area, we are the first Islamic state in the area and with this status we must be ready to unify the island like never before. Where previous states in our area were troubled by internal struggles, we will learn from their mistakes and proclaim a stronger and more centralized state."
 ties_to_java: "Ties to Java"
 ties_to_java_desc: "Part of our population hail directly from Java and Javanese culture has permiated throughout the various communities of Banjar for decades now. We would be wise to capitalize on our partial Javanese heritage and do as they do: build up a strong and robust naval force that is capable of securing our coastal land. In time, this will help cement Banjar as a true force to be feared on this island and the many others in the Nusantara."
 migratory_ties_around_nusantara: "Migratory Ties"
 migratory_ties_around_nusantara_desc: "The Banjar people are not bound to just Banjar Sultanate alone, not at all. Migration occurs and Banjar merchants travel abroad to various communities where they sometimes settle down in, spreading our influence in foreign lands. By using these various pockets of Banjar people in diplomatic matters, we can better proclaim our right to lands outside of Borneo itself."
 cooperate_with_the_dayak_people: "Equals with the Dayak People"
 cooperate_with_the_dayak_people_desc: "The Dayak people are the indigenous people of South Kalimantan and though they are not Muslims like the majority of Banjar people are, the Dayaks are equal to our own. We must learn to respect and cooperate with them since they make up a good portion of our core population; doing so can help us learn to control internal matters to a greater degree in the future."
 repel_the_javanese: "Repel Coastal Invasions"
 repel_the_javanese_desc: "It is from the coast that we will find many invasions coming for us. Banjar has several lucrative trade ports that people from Java, Sumatra, and Makassar value, so defending them through refined strategies inland in conjunction with well-built ships will be crucial to our survival."
 trade_with_makassar: "Trade with Makassar"
 trade_with_makassar_desc: "Makassar is the closest island to Borneo and has been a great trade partner of Banjar for ages now. We trade in not only foods and spices, but also in cultural aspects as well, meaning that the populations of both islands are ready to cooperate with each other when necessary."
 securing_bornean_tributaries: "Secure Tributary States"
 securing_bornean_tributaries_desc: "Banjar's starting position had several tributary states in place with Banjarmasin being the central point in which authority was held. Though we are more centralized than our past, we still need a steady stream of tributary states to exert our influence outward toward different lands and islands. The number of internal tributaries paying orderly tribute will serve as an example to foreigners who wish to be apart of our system."

 field_experience_of_wu_sangui_desc: "Wu Sangui was the one in charge of suppressing and consolidating the southwestern portion of China after the Manchus of the north swept through the Ming Dynasty. It is with his leadership and experience in the field of battle as general under the Ming Dynasty that we march forth against those who would oppose our authority."
 intimate_knowledge_of_china: "Intimate Knowledge of China"
 intimate_knowledge_of_china_desc: "Because of Wu Sangui's experience that he brought with him, the people in the Zhou administration have extensive knowledge of China's layout, its major roads, its major cities, just about everything there is to know for now. Going forth, we should use this knowledge to our advantage when dealing with both warring states in China and also those who want to strike up deals with us in the future."
 opportunity_at_every_turn: "Opportunity at Every Turn"
 opportunity_at_every_turn_desc: "Like our founders opportunistic self, the administration and diplomatic arm of Zhou must be ready for opportunities at a mere moments notice. Being flexible in this regard will be key to how we survive and thrive in not only China, but on the greater world stage."
 consolidate_the_southwest: "Consolidate the Southwest"
 consolidate_the_southwest_desc: "The hilly and tropical terrain of Southwest China has historically been hard to control because of the various tribes and clans that live here. The Yi and Miao may be the largest cultural groups, but many other smaller minorites exist that we will need to accomadate in some manner if we ever seek to consolidate true authority in the region."
 reinforce_supply_routes: "Reinforce Supply Routes"
 reinforce_supply_routes_desc: "What our home region has taught us is that supply routes are absolutely crucial to fielding any sort of military force. Proper depots, ammunition storage, food reserves, everything that encompasses 'logistics' needs to be taken care of to the greatest possible degree in Zhou for future campaigns."
 suppress_tribal_sentiment: "Suppress Tribal Sentiment"
 suppress_tribal_sentiment_desc: "The tribes and clans of the southwest, though pacified to a degree, are not always happy with our administration or they have disputes of there own that boil over into great bouts of conflict inside our own territory. We must mediate and suppress these rebellious sentiment through both civil means, and military means if things eventually come to that."

 rise_of_the_great_zhou_desc: "With the fall of the Ming Dynasty and the shattering of all that was once whole and united in the Middle Kingdom, the ashes have tried to reform themselves, rising up and reaching for the throne they want, but collapsing as their fingers near the radiant glow of it. Let the rising of the Great Zhou Dynasty be the first to firmly hold on to the throne that the Ming Dynasty left vacant, and let our valor and effort light the path to victory!"

 consolidate_sumtatran_land_desc: "After the destruction of the Pasai Sultanate, much of the northern lands in Sumatra were left in disarray as Hindus and Muslims strived to reclaim what unity there was before. Being one of the contenders here, we shall proclaim ourselves as the true successors to Pasai and use Islam to gain the upper hand in the land. Unification will not come easily and we will need an effective army to battle our foes in every direction."
 strait_combat: "Strait Combat"
 strait_combat_desc: "The Strait of Malacca is where a great amount of trade flows through, meaning that there is a great amount of profit to be made if one is to control the entire thing. To help extend our own control over the lucrative region, we should be arming our merchant vessels more heavily so that they can do battle with whoever they encounter."
 wider_muslim_world_support: "Support from Western Muslims"
 wider_muslim_world_support_desc: "With new technology and faster communication via faster ships, we are coming into contact with Muslims from Arabia and Persia at an increasing rate. Many people travel to Aceh and from Aceh to explore the worlds of east and west, meaning that both sides are attracting a great amount of traders and scholars. By cultivating this positive maritime trade of ideas and people, Aceh will become a true entrepot for Sumatra and more."
 modernize_acehnese_firearms: "Modernize Acehnese Weapons"
 modernize_acehnese_firearms_desc: "To fight in these changing times is to fight with modern weaponry in the form of better cannons and better muskets.

 successor_to_pasai: "Successor to Pasai"
 successor_to_pasai_desc: "As we grow in strength and prosperity, it is becoming greatly evident that we are the only true successor to the Pasai Sultanate. Through fires of war and the blood spilled in feuds, Aceh's sultans and viziers are promoting what the Pasai Sultanate strived for. Let us not let our ancestors down, and let us march forth into the future with glory and honor."
 islamic_bastion_of_sumatra: "Islamic Bastion of Sumatra"
 islamic_bastion_of_sumatra_desc: "Much like how the Pasai Sultanate was a bastion of Islam for Sumatra, we are as well. Unlike those of Pasai though, we can take to spreading Islam due to having the foundations of the faith firmly established. Along with this, Islamic scholars from the west can surely help us out in this endeavor as well."
 the_looming_hostage_crisis: "Solve the Hostage Crisis"
 the_looming_hostage_crisis_desc: "What we have been doing when we conquer territory is that, we take a portion of the people from the cities back to our own territory as hostages, using them as we please for labor or other matters. This can and will lead to increased strife within Aceh since these people will become so numerous that they will eventually want to revolt. We must put a stop to this practice now and institute new practices when we conquer land; we would rather not set ourselves up for disaster in the decades to come."

 cultivate_iron_production: "Cultivate Iron Production"
 cultivate_iron_production_desc: "For a very long time now, we have taken iron deposits from inland and brought them closer to the coast and smelted them down into various tools and weapons. These tools and weapons are what have helped us thrive so far, letting Luwu become an influential political entity that likes of which Sulawesi has rarely seen."
 key_trade_links_in_nusantara: "Key Trade Links"
 key_trade_links_in_nusantara_desc: "All throughout the Nusantara, there are polities that trade with the various island chains for various resources. Sulawesi is well within this exchange though it is not the most politically unified at times due to a variety of factors, it still manages to be an entrepot for several merchants from both inside Nusantara and outside of it."
 fighting_through_the_jungle: "Fighting through the Tropics"
 fighting_through_the_jungle_desc: "The tropical nature of Sulawesi means military movements are tough for all troops involved. Having no knowledge of the terrain can easily lead to disaster, but Luwu is the exact opposite in this regard. Connections to inland polities and people groups has allowed us to cultivate a system of directional navigation through tough terrain that we can use not only on Sulawesi, but on other islands too."

 those_who_defend_desc: "And when a foreign invader attempts to invade the lands of Sulawesi, or any other land we control, what will they encounter? A myriad of traps and obstacles on top of natural defenses that nature itself has provided. The people of Sulawesi are well versed in defensive types of warfare thanks to the terrain of the island chain; few if any can match the tenacity that they provide in this defensive regard."
 buginese_cooperation_with_natives: "Learning to Cooperate"
 buginese_cooperation_with_natives_desc: "Our core people, the Buginese people, are actually migrants to Sulawesi. The island chain is the home of the Buginese people now, but the indigenous people need to be treated with respect and care if Luwu is to be stable and prosperous. Whatever path we take in the future, we will be in harmony with our people groups, whether they come from Sulawesi itself or from outside of our core islands."
 gunpowder_rise: "Gunpowder Influx"
 gunpowder_rise_desc: "With gunpowder weapons being more readily available throughout Nusantara as the decades have gone by, we of Sulawesi cannot afford to be stagnant in our ways. There are states that would threaten us from all directions and indeed they use gunpowder to a degree that we would not be able to stand up to them if they invaded us. Modernization efforts need to be put in place for all of our military troops and sailors, no matter the cost."
 structure_luwu_society: "Structuring Luwu Society"
 structure_luwu_society_desc: "Luwu society has been relatively fluid and somewhat tribal for a long while, but increasingly this is becoming hard to manage as time goes on. Populations are increasing rapidly and we cannot maintain tribal ties that undermine the Luwu administration. Structuring society over time to fit a more rigid model that does away with most if not all tribal ties can help Luwu prosper and make it a much more powerful trader throughout Nusantara."

 majapahit_influences_desc: "In the times of old, we were once a tributary of the once mighty Majapahit Empire. Though their time has long since passed by and the Javanese are off doing their own thing, Makassar has taken in the influence of Majapahit to a degree and benefited because of it. What they used to prosper we should use as well, and it starts with cultivating where our people dwell in: the cities and towns."
 islamic_influences: "Islamic Influence"
 islamic_influences_desc: "Islamic traders have been seen in our waters since the 1300s and indeed their influence has been positive for a majority of people. Though they may preach their strange beliefs to our people at times, we are more interested in how they can teach us about innovative trading practices. If we take them up on these practices, we can greatly increase the revenue of our own trade ports."

We welcome them openly and, so long as they do not inflict violence on us and do not violate our customs, want them to stay with us so that they can converse with not only our merchants and traders, but also our scholars as well. Cultural exchange is only helpful for Makassar in this regard."
 centralize_sulawesi_power: "Centralize Makassar's Power"
 centralize_sulawesi_power_desc: "To coincide with the rise of Makassarese influence around Sulawesi, it is natural that centralizing power is also needed alongside this.

A heart split into pieces is no heart at all, that is a fact."
 coastal_defense: "Coastal Defenses"
 coastal_defense_desc: "Living so near the coast at all times, Buton and its people are in need of a great many defensive structures as it is. On top of this, Buton's own ships need to be ready for whatever comes their way, which is where training the sailors comes into play."

 ship_building_sector_desc: "With how Buton is situated, it is in a very suitable location for building ships of various sizes, that is if we have the harbors and docks to actually build them in. By promoting the construction of coastal structures and learning how to build them more efficiently, we can speed up our rate of ship production greatly."
 enforce_political_cohesion: "Enforce Political Cohesion"
 enforce_political_cohesion_desc: "When worse comes to worse in Buton, our navy working with our army will be what secures us political power legitimacy.

There are various royal classes, non-royal nobility, free men of the land, people who work in various castes, and then finally slaves. Along with this, griots are important for telling the ancestral tales and history of Jolof, so they occupt a social class all unto themselves. This hierarchy of social classes must be retained throughout Jolof if it is to be a stable state, with reformations only happening once we are sure we are ready."
 animism_with_islam: "Traditions, and Islam"
 animism_with_islam_desc: "Islam was brought unto us from the east by people from the Mali Empire but it has not taken root as it has further to the east and north. In Jolof, some of the nobles of our land mix Islam with our native traditions, but still the majority of our people embrace that which is from our traditions. The more we can embrace parts of Islam in conjunction with our own traditional beliefs, the better off we will be as a whole."

 the_queen_mother_desc: "The 'linger', or, Queen Mother, of Jolof is the head of all women in Jolof and it is she who has some of the most influence over politics in general.

Such a position shall be revered throughout Jolof's entirety and never be done away with."
 tributary_kingdom_system: "Tributary Kingdoms"
 tributary_kingdom_system_desc: "Jolof at its core has been made up of tributary states leading back to a central authority. Jolof historically has been landlocked and the coastal states it presided over paid tribute to the central authority that is Jolof; we should be adjusting this tributary state method of governance as times goes on so we can still exact tribute and funds from our subjects but also govern them in a proper manner."
 elected_head_of_state: "Election of the 'Bour ba'"
 elected_head_of_state_desc: "The election of the ruler (called the 'Bour ba') is done by a college of electors from the respective tributary states. Those tributary states have their rulers elected from the nobility, and those state rulers come together to elect the ruler of Jolof as a whole. This system of governance has a tendency to be abused by our tributaries, but we can use force if need be to help reform and adjust this system to a more regulated and cogent system."
 balance_out_coastal_trade: "Balancing out Coastal Trade"
 balance_out_coastal_trade_desc: "Because of developments beyond our control, there is an imbalance in the areas of Jolof. Coastal areas are becoming more wealthy than inland areas due to the rise in international trade and this is having a troubling effect on Jolof itself. To remedy this, we must setup roads and communication networks of some form so that Jolof is less landlocked and more easily able to access the coast from its tributary states. If all goes well, trade potential and wealth distribution will equal out over time."
 an_empire_unto_jolof: "A Future for Ourselves"
 an_empire_unto_jolof_desc: "With administrative matters being sorted and diplomacy through trade being conducted effectively, Jolof must turn to its military so that it can keep up its own strength. Becoming a true empire requires conquest, proper defense, and most of all, an organized military. By incorporating our tributaries into this military system, Jolof can proclaim a more unified military than other empires in West Africa's past."
 KBU_ideas: "Kaabu Ideas"
 KBU_ideas_start: "Kaabu Traditions"
 KBU_ideas_bonus: "Kaabu Ambition"
 malian_legacy: "Mali's Legacy"
 malian_legacy_desc: "We were on the fringes of the Mali Empire at its height though we did feel the effects of the political and military organization that Mali spread outward. We of Kaabu being a claimant of Mali's legacy should not discard these foundational elements that the Mali Empire left behind. Instead, we will build upon it and create a lasting empire that is a true successor to the once mighty 'Manden Kurufaba'."
 warrior_elites_of_kansala: "Warrior Elites of Kansala"
 warrior_elites_of_kansala_desc: "The heart of our people is at Kansala and it is there that a great many warriors gather regularly not only to serve Kaabu but also to refine their tactics through field training. Granted we have to make sure this training does not turn into a bloody competition between the highest ranking warriors, Kansala's warrior elites do serve to embed a militaristic marking on all of Kaabu."
 the_koring_and_nyancho_clans: "The Koring and Nyancho Clans"
 the_koring_and_nyancho_clans_desc: "The two head clans of Kaabu are that of the Koring and the Nyancho and they are both very militaristic in nature. They make their money and reputation off of warfare that involves Kaabu and as such help manage most of the Kaabu military. Though the degree of effective military management can vary at times, the military councils they hold and the way in which they take to logistical matters is nothing short of impressive for all of West Africa."
 malian_cavalry_legacy: "Malian Military Organization"
 malian_cavalry_legacy_desc: "Capitalizing more on how Mali organized its military, cavalry tactics is something that we should naturally focus on since the cavalry culture from the Mali Empire still permeates throughout Kaabu. Using various weapons on horseback and building our strategies around what our cavalry can do is what will aid us best in the future."
 fortify_kaabu_frontiers: "Roots as an Outpost"
 fortify_kaabu_frontiers_desc: "Originally, Kansala and the area that is core to Kaabu was just a military outpost established by the Mali Empire. Over the decades though, it has evolved into a center of culture and military might that must be defended at any cost. Since Kaabu's inception, we have relied more on offense over defense, but seeing as Kansala is becoming more and more central to our administration and military, and our trade depots are increasingly valued by a number of different groups, we need to properly fortify what we currently hold with walls and garrisons."
 importation_of_musket_weaponry: "Importing Gunpowder Weapons"
 importation_of_musket_weaponry_desc: "With trade along our coast increasing as time goes on, the weapons we are getting from trade are becoming more and more useful as time goes on. Though traditional weapons are doing us well, gunpowder weapons are making a large impact on Kaabu's military potential, especially when dealing with less organized tribes inside and outside our domain. Integrating these new weapons fully into our military will undoubtedly bring us victory after victory in the ages to come."
 stop_the_muslim_advances: "The Wars of Religion"
 stop_the_muslim_advances_desc: "Religious wars are something that we do not practice regularly, but those outside of us, especially those who follow Islam and Christianity with the utmost strictness, they practice these wars of religion quite regularly. If they want to bring this strange practice to the mighty armies of Kaabu, then they will be beaten in their own game."

 FUL_ideas_bonus: "Fulani Ambition"
 violent_migrations: "Violent Migrations"
 violent_migrations_desc: "Our start was in the days of migration across West Africa, and in these days of migration we fought against settled states for every piece of land we could get. The Mali Empire tried to stop us before, but with their destruction and the rise of the Fulo state, few will avoid giving in to our demands for land and concessions."
 cavalry_of_the_fulo: "Cavalry of the Fulani"
 cavalry_of_the_fulo_desc: "To supplement our migrations from the past and to aid our military today, cavalry have been integral to the very nature of the Fulani people. Their useful nature as civilian animals for farmers and such is great, but using them for skirmishing and full on charges against enemy armies in times of war is what we will truly need them for."
 clashes_over_gold: "Clashes over Gold"
 clashes_over_gold_desc: "The valuable gold mines that the Mali Empire are what helped made it prosper like no other empire had in West Africa's history. Seizing them as the Mali Empire decays away will line the pockets of Fulani nobles and royals to the point where they, collectively, can field an army like no other in all of West Africa."
 war_over_falling_states: "Warring State Chaos"
 war_over_falling_states_desc: "The lack of a large empire in West Africa that can hold power over several areas means that warring states are common. The decaying influence of the Mali Empire has given rise to the state of West Africa that the Fulani have come upon, but they are not going to be swallowed up by the chaos surrounding them. The Fulani will tame the chaos floating about and rein them into a suitable empire."
 muslim_influence_over_the_fulo: "Increasing Muslim Influences"
 muslim_influence_over_the_fulo_desc: "Mali's rulers were Muslim indeed and so are the rulers of eastern states in West Africa, but what of the Fulani leaders? That will be answered at a later date, but none can deny that Muslim influence is increasing over the entire Fulani population. The Muslim influx brings with it more manpower for our military, but it will also bring questions that our administration must answer in time."
 the_influence_of_the_torodbe: "The Torodbe"
 the_influence_of_the_torodbe_desc: "They have risen from all parts of those who live in the Western Sudanese region and have been gaining slow influence all throughout the Sahel. The Fulo state is not immune to their influential teachings and several nobles are keen on listening to the words of the Torodbe leaders; they seek to eliminate the remnants of our traditional religion and even encourage jihad against others, but still not every single part of Fulo is on board with them. We cannot expel the Torodbe from our lands it seems, but maybe we can use them for good as times goes on?"
 cut_down_regional_chiefs: "Strike down Regional Chiefs"
 cut_down_regional_chiefs_desc: "In order to keep order within the wider Fulo state, we will need to deal with tribal ties that are heavily ingrained with local communities. These regional chiefs and leaders who hold sway amongst various communities far away from our capital area need to be reined in either through diplomatic means or military force and judging from our fiery past, the latter will be of no issue for us."

 KAN_ideas_bonus: "Kano Ambition"
 descended_from_bayajidda: "Descendants of Bayajidda"
 descended_from_bayajidda_desc: "Founder of the Hausa states, Bayajidda was, according to legend, a prince from Baghdad that was exiled after the city was conquered by Queen Zidam. He went west and south with a large group of warriors and eventually arrived in Borno and from here the legend begins to diverge a little depending on where one is situated. Regardless of this divergence though, all Hausa states know that they are descendants of Bayajidda and are the legitimate Hausa Bakwai."
 chiefs_of_indigo: "Chiefs of Indigo"
 chiefs_of_indigo_desc: "We of Kano and Rano are known as the 'Chiefs of Indigo'. Cotten grows in plentiful amounts in our home areas and as such, we produce a great amount of cloth and dyed clothing for other cities and states around us. Continuing this tradition into the future will ensure a prosperous and colorful future for all of Kano."
 grand_centers_of_trade: "Hausa Centers of Trade"
 grand_centers_of_trade_desc: "The Hausa states are divided along political lines at times, but one thing that they all have in common (besides heritage) is the fact that they make for great traders and merchants. Hausa trade hubs are valued by many people groups like the Kanuri, the Nupe, the Yoruba, and even the Songhai. Who is to say we can't keep this tradition going into the future?"
 supporters_of_foreign_revolts: "Support Foreign Unrest"
 supporters_of_foreign_revolts_desc: "On our borders, there are a number of people groups who are not content with their overlord's authority. We are working on our own situation in regards to this, but seeing as there is opportunity in supporting foreign unrest so that the borders and influence of Kano might expand, we should welcome these possibilities in the years to come."
 manage_animist_islamic_relations: "Managing Religious Relations"
 manage_animist_islamic_relations_desc: "Islam and traditional animist beliefs of the Hausa people are intermingling constantly but there is not a true consensus as to what the religion of the Hausa people should be. In an effort to appease both sides, we should attempt to tolerate both sides here and make a state that can thrive off of multiple religions interacting with each other in peace."
 center_of_muslim_scholarship: "Center of Muslim Scholarship"
 center_of_muslim_scholarship_desc: "Kano leans toward the Islamic side of matters when it comes to religion and indeed our capital city has become a center of Muslim scholarship as of late. Promoting the trade of ideas that these scholars bring through is something that Kano would greatly benefit from."
 tributary_empire_legacy: "A True Tributary Empire"
 tributary_empire_legacy_desc: "The states of the Hausa people and indeed those that surround them are fit for paying tribute to us instead of being outright conquered and forced into submission. By setting up a formal code of laws and tributary restrictions and rights for this entire matter, the Hausa people can benefit greatly."

 KTS_ideas_bonus: "Katsina Ambition"
 chiefs_of_the_caravans: "Chiefs of the Markets"
 chiefs_of_the_caravans_desc:  "The location of Katsina and Daura allows the easy control of incoming caravans for all of the Hausa people and cities. Increasing the hold over these trade routes and formalizing the system in which they trade in will make Katsina and Daura all the more prosperous, lining the pockets of Hausa nobles and merchants alike."
 expand_the_gidan_korau: "Expand the Royal Palace"
 expand_the_gidan_korau_desc: "The royal palace is named 'Gidan Korau' or, House of Korau, and it is perhaps the oldest palace in all of the lands of the Hausa people. With its prestige and wonder being well known throughout the region, we should take to expanding the palace and modernizing it as time goes on so that we can handle any administrative task that comes our way."
 hausa_style_walls: "Walls of the Hausa"
 hausa_style_walls_desc: "To help shield ourselves from incoming raids and invasions, our people and military have constructed rudimentary walls around our capital city which has caught the eye of Katsina engineers. If we can work with them and engineer stronger and more stalwart defenses with Hausa-style architecture, there will be few who can threaten the likes of any Hausa-controlled city, or, at least any Katsina-controlled city."

 chiefs_of_slaves: "Chief of Slaves"
 chiefs_of_slaves_desc: "The power we wield amongst the traditional Hausa kingdoms is that of being the slave keeper, supplying labor to the various cities of the Hausa people. Our place in the grand scheme of things is crucial to the way of life in our region and the Hausa people depend on the practice of slavery for now, and so long as they do, Zazzau will continue to provide and be the distributor of human labor."
 ambitious_zazzau: "Thirst for Conquest"
 ambitious_zazzau_desc: "The fire that burns within the heart of Zazzau is not that of hatred for others per say, but rather the fire yearns for a prosperous and unified Hausa people with the seat of governance in Zazzau itself. For far too long we have waged war with our fellow Hausa cities to no avail; there must be a person and a city to break the stalemate once and for all! If Zazzau must be that righteous giver of firey justice so that the Hausa may be united, then so it shall be."
 slow_spread_of_islam: "Islam in Zazzau"
 slow_spread_of_islam_desc: "The more we spread our influence, the more we see Islam making its way into the ranks of Zazzau's nobility, merchant class, and peasantry. Though we are not set on adopting every single principle of Islam from the very start, we are interested in what ideas it can bring to us. Perhaps we can make a more tolerant Zazzau with the influx of these Muslims?"

 HAU_ideas_bonus: "Gobir Ambition"
 chiefs_of_protection: "Chief of Protection"
 chiefs_of_protection_desc: "Our duty to the Hausa people and to our kin to the east has always been protecting the western corridor from threats. Malian and Songhai conquests have consistently knocked at the door of the Hausa people to no end, leading to bloody skirmishes that cause great strife throughout our homeland. We must never forget our task as the defenders of the Hausa people; we must always keep our military prowess a cut above the rest and keep our men in the best fighting shape possible."
 mali_and_songhai_threats: "Threats to the West"
 mali_and_songhai_threats_desc: "The border between our land and the fearsome powers to our west is often blurred and inconsistent. Whilst this makes for easy land claims for the people of Gobir, it also means that our enemies are on the same level as us in regards to how easy it is to take land. Let us meet them on the open fields of war and fight them to the very end, for Gobir fears no tribe, kingdom, or empire."
 assert_military_authority_for_hausa: "Control the Hausa Kingdoms"
 assert_military_authority_for_hausa_desc: "It is unfortunate that we cannot leave our fellow Hausa cities and states as friendly independent entities near us, for they are always in a position to be invaded from elsewhere and succumb to external threats. In order to help secure the lands of the Hausa, we must make them subservient to Gobir and ensure that they are safely within our domain."

 imperial_memory_in_administration: "Imperial Memories in Sardinia"
 imperial_memory_in_administration_desc: "The Byzantines may not be long for this world, but they did have a lasting impact on Sardinia and its governing system as a whole even after the Moorish incursion after the Byzantines had left for more pressing matters. Our governance is modeled somewhat after what the Byzantines had implemented and in keeping with it, it ensures a greater degree of trust and faithfulness in the administration as a whole."
 one_of_the_few_without_feudalism: "Feudalism? In Sardinia?"
 one_of_the_few_without_feudalism_desc: "The feudal structure that is prevalent around Europe is in many ways alien to Sardinian people. Our lands are not regarded as the personal property of the monarch, the opposite of which is apparently quite common in monarchies elsewhere in Europe. We even have national assemblies known as the 'Crown of the Realm' are still present as well, giving us a degree of democratic notion in our style of governance, but even this is not present in much of Europe. Regardless of how alien things are, we will be more ready and adaptable to change than they will ever be."
 centralize_the_judicates: "Centralize the Judicates"
 centralize_the_judicates_desc: "Sardinia, after the fall of Byzantine influence and the failure of Moorish forces, was divided into separate judicates all vying for power by allying with different foreign powers. We must stop this decentralization of power that can destabilize us from the inside out and instead cultivate a more central authority for all the judicates."
 reject_iberians_and_papists: "Rejecting Iberians and Papists"
 reject_iberians_and_papists_desc: "The Kingdom of Aragon and the Papal States have tried time and time again to capture Sardinia and impose their influence over the Sardinian peopl and they've had success in the past. We must always be working to stave off their influence and to limit their diplomatic ties within Sardinia since they are the most potent threats to our livelihood."
 institute_the_carta_de_logu: "Instititute the 'Carta de Logu'"
 institute_the_carta_de_logu_desc: "It was during 1392 that the Judicate of Arborea devised and pushed forth the 'Carta de Logu' or, Charter of the Land. Marianus IV of Arborea compiled the code and it was updated by his daughter (Eleanor of Sardinia) later on. In this code, many citizen rights were established and it even gave a fair amount of rights to women as well; we would be foolish to not implement this law code again and to update it as time goes on."
 maintain_the_corona_de_logu: "Maintain the 'Corona de Logu'"
 maintain_the_corona_de_logu_desc: "The Judicate of Arborea maintained the 'Crown of the Realm' which was in part a national assembly and also a parliament of sorts, going through legislation and being the main legal body by which laws were brought forth and passed. Instituting this body of administration once more and reforming it with necessary changes as times goes on will serve to keep Sardinia politically and administratively flexibly unlike various monarchies around us."
 arboreas_ambition_come_to_life: "The Legacy of Arborea"
 arboreas_ambition_come_to_life_desc: "Though the grave for the Judicate of Arborea is already upon the land, their legacy lives on through us and all of the Sardinian people. Uniting them into one cohesive state and ousting all others from the lands of Sardinia is something that the Judicare of Arborea wasn't able to do, but it was something they so desperately wanted. That is what we shall seek out and once it is accomplished, we will not stop there for the glory and greatness of Sardinia."
 KNG_ideas: "Kong Ideas"

 KNG_ideas_bonus: "Kong Ambition"
 migrants_from_mali: "Migrants from Mali's Collapse"
 migrants_from_mali_desc: "Our foundations are somewhat murky and unclear, but what foundation we can know firmly is that many of our people hail from the old Mali Empire. Though not as powerful as it once was and crumbling to outside influence and internal decay, those migrants from Mali have made their home in the lands of Kong and helped it prosper ever since."
 coming_from_different_war_houses: "From Different War Houses"
 coming_from_different_war_houses_desc: "The founding people of Kong were not from one single dynasty or one single clan or war house, but rather they were from several different war houses. Their names have changed over the decades but what remains the same throughout time is the contribution to the military potential within Kong itself. Their fearsome and powerful legacy is something we strive to uphold."
 indifference_to_kong_religion: "Money over Religion"
 indifference_to_kong_religion_desc: "When people ask the leaders of Kong, 'What religion do your slaves and workers follow?', they will answer, 'It does not matter. As long as they serve us well, they may worship as they please.'. This mentality has been key in our rise to prominence and will continue to do so since we place more emphasis on money and fighting tactics as opposed to the zealous conversion of our own people."
 establish_mercantile_houses: "Establishing Mercantile Houses"
 establish_mercantile_houses_desc: "Whilst the war houses of Kong are plentiful and sometimes a bit hard to control, the increasing flow of trade through our lands means that there should be some system setup so that we can profit in a more systematic manner. Establishing mercantile houses and setting up formal places for merchants to flock to will increase our viability as a trade partner."
 money_buys_armies: "Buying the Troops Needed"
 money_buys_armies_desc: "With trade flowing throughout Kong and money flowing in at a greater rate, we can focus on procuring fine warriors from surrounding tribes and states. Mercenary contracts can help fill in the empty ranks within the Kong armies and we have plenty of money to keep them happy."
 expanding_kong_merchant_armies: "Expansive Merchant Armies"
 expanding_kong_merchant_armies_desc: "The staying power of mercenaries in Kong armies and the lucrative trade that we profit from has come to make us somewhat reliant on steady mercenary contracts. Though we certainly have our own warriors to rely on, the mercenary contracts for Kong are becoming increasingly regulated and easy to come by."
 formal_royal_houses: "Formal Royal Houses"
 formal_royal_houses_desc: "Kong's power is firm on the outside to many, but inside it is still somewhat fragile. War houses and mercantile houses are still coming into conflict with each other at times and with each new feud, our power degrades slightly. Let us try to resolve these disputes from the top-down and institute new succession laws with distinct and formal royal houses that all of Kong recognizes."

 TMB_ideas_bonus: "Timbuktu Ambition"
 historical_trade_center: "Historical Trade Center"
 historical_trade_center_desc: "For several decades now, Timbuktu has been a trade center unlike any other in the Sahel Region. From the north come traders from the lands of Morocco and from the west, south, and east come traders from the many plains and river systems of West Africa. Keeping Timbuktu as it is and cultivating its greatest parts can only bring more wealth and grandeur to the city and the people who live in it."
 center_for_muslim_scholars: "Center for Muslim Scholars"
 center_for_muslim_scholars_desc: "From our dusty foundation to now, Muslim scholars have flocked to Timbuktu not only because it is a city of wealth, but also because it was once part of the great Mali Empire. Though now resigned to the texts of history, Malian influence on Timbuktu helped us greatly and the gifts Muslim scholars bring to us is always appreciated."
 the_three_madrasas_of_timbuktu: "The Three Madrasas"
 the_three_madrasas_of_timbuktu_desc: "The Sankore, Djinguereber, and Sidi Yaha Madrasas are the three most important centers of learning inside of Timbuktu. Though centered around Islamic education, these three lucrative and grand centers of knowledge have and will continue to help propel Timbuktu into prominence both through divulging new ideas for us to take up and by attracting foreign scholars in time."
 commercial_endeavors_for_us: "Commercial Endeavors"
 commercial_endeavors_for_us_desc: "Whilst our natural progression in terms of commercial wealth is great, we could do better by ensuring that our own merchants are well protected by guards and also educated to a fair degree. The central administration of Timbuktu would be wise to perhaps fund a school of sorts dedicated entirely to training and perfecting the art of being a merchant."
 develop_the_gift_of_the_niger: "Develop the Gift of the Niger"
 develop_the_gift_of_the_niger_desc: "A nickname for our great city has been the 'gift of the Niger', eluding to the fact that we are one of the largest and wealthiest cities along the Niger River. We could use the wealth we gain from our grand capital to develop infrastructure in surrounding areas, especially along the Niger River, and perhaps make a second Timbuktu somewhere along the lines."
 secure_the_trans_sahara_trade: "The Sahara Trade Routes"
 secure_the_trans_sahara_trade_desc: "Mastering the trade routes across the Sahara is not easy, but those close to it can learn how they flow and where they regularly come through to. As Timbuktu has always been a natural stopping point for some Saharan trade routes for centuries at this point, it is only natural that we become masters of them."
 tuareg_connections: "Tuareg Connections"
 tuareg_connections_desc: "The versatile and sometimes hostile Tuareg people of the Sahara and Sahel Region swear fealty to no state for long. They are akin to mercenaries that can strike fear into the hearts of many in Timbuktu, but we can also negotiate with them for their services in protecting our trade caravans and such. It is better to be in good standing with these fearsome people than to be their consistent enemy."

 long_range_trading: "Long Range Trading"
 long_range_trading_desc: "We of Bonoman get caravans from states all across the savannah and even the Sahel Region. Lucrative is the trade we indulge in and profit lines all the pockets of our merchants and leaders. Few can resist the temptation of coming to Bonoman markets, and fewer still will leave empty-handed."
 nucleus_at_markets: "Markets are our Heart"
 nucleus_at_markets_desc: "Bonoman cities and towns are not traditionally centered around a palace or military fortress, but rather they are centered around markets where people do business and make money. Whilst strange to other people, it has served us well so far and kept us afloat financially whereas other people suffer when centered around palaces or fortifications, leaving markets to grow much more slowly."
 increase_iron_smelting_capacity: "More Iron Smelting"
 increase_iron_smelting_capacity_desc: "Though we do smelt iron ore into iron for other states and people groups around us, there are others who compete with us in this regard. We need to ensure that Bonoman states are competitive with how much iron they produce and how good the iron is in quality, for if we can outdo our neighbors in this regard, we will secure positive trade relations as well as even more wealth."
 the_akan_gold_trade: "The Akan Gold Trade"
 the_akan_gold_trade_desc: "The lucrative Akan Gold Trade is valued by many around the Bonoman states and we are an integral part of it. The once great Mali Empire even invaded our lands to claim hegemony over the Akan Gold Trade, but their influence did not last long since we asserted our own independence not long after they came through. From now into the future, let the Akan Gold Trade bring wealth and stability to those of the Bonoman states!"
 taxing_trade_routes: "Taxes from Trade"
 taxing_trade_routes_desc: "The many trade routes that come through our land are valuable in many senses, so why not formalize the taxes we impose upon them? They shouldn't be too high so that they drive away business, but they also shouldn't be too low so that the Bonoman states start suffering financially."
 bonoman_blacksmithing: "Bonoman Blacksmithing"
 bonoman_blacksmithing_desc: "Whilst our blacksmiths are used to providing arms to people groups outside of the general vicinity of the Bonoman states, perhaps we can start producing weapons more for our own people. Arming them and training them in a particular style unique to us 'Abron' people could give us a distinct advantage in the future."
 unify_the_bonoman_states: "Unify the Bonoman States"
 unify_the_bonoman_states_desc: "For far too long the Abron people have been split into decentralized states that collectively constituted the 'Bonoman nation'. Introducing a series of centralizing reforms and taking in foreign ideas that are brought to us through trade routes could have a positive effect, and it could help unify the divided states into a solid and cohesive state for the Abron people."

 drum_chant_histories_desc: "Much of the history of the Dagomba people are recorded not through writing, but through drum chants that are extensive and lengthy. They symbolize not only our people's journey throughout time but also their creativity in keeping the memories of the past preserved for future generations."
 the_king_of_strength: "The King of Strength"
 the_king_of_strength_desc: "Our king is known as the 'Ya Naa', or, 'King of Strength', which stems from the foundation of the Dagbon state itself by Sitogu. The king demonstrates not only his own strength at several times but also in his willingness to defend the Dagomba people in person and with the collective power of the Dagomba warriors."

 govern_over_the_indigenous_people_desc: "The people we have come to govern in our foundational days (like the  Konkomba, Nafeba, Basare, and the Chamba) are still around, though in a reduced set of numbers. We have come to terms with them and the Dagomba people are getting along with the indigenous groups, making for a more cohesive and productive central state."
 implement_the_surviving_tengdamba: "Utilize the Surviving Tengdamba"
 implement_the_surviving_tengdamba_desc: "The tengdamba/tengdana were earth priests who owned the land before the Dagomba people came through and conquered the indigenous people. They resisted us as one might expect and many tengdamba were killed along the way, but the remaining ones have proven to be loyal enough to us that they are being implemented as loyal local administrators and military officers."
 invest_in_islamic_matters: "Islamic Investing?"
 invest_in_islamic_matters_desc: "Islam is continuing to be a factor in our politics and societal structure, but we are still skeptical as to what to do about it on a large-scale. Investing in the syncretism between our own traditions and Islam is perhaps the best path here since the traditions of Dagbon are deeply entrenched within our people."
 centralized_political_structuring: "Centralize our Politics"
 centralized_political_structuring_desc: "Decentralized politics is keeping the Dagbomba people from making serious strides in reformation of administrative matters as well as societal traditions. Continuously we are seeing new ideas spread around us, but we are constantly being challenged by old notions of how to do things that hinder us. We need a concentrated effort to break down barriers and reform parts of the Dagbon state so that new ideas are more readily taken in by us."
 expand_at_others_expense: "Policy of Expansion"
 expand_at_others_expense_desc: "The areas around the Dagomba people's homeland are not truly safe and peaceful; there are rivals on all sides, both in the shadows and in the open sunlight.

 the_only_oromo_confederation_desc: "We are alone, in a sense. There are no other Oromo states, it is only us in the world. Our kin may be scattered about in nearby areas and regions, but they are not independent like we are. As the beacon of hope for the Oromo people, we must rally them to our banners and show them that with enough tenacity and ferocity, a day clear of smoke and blood is possible. Let them flock to us and be part of the only Oromo confederation there is."
 abba_boku_style_administration: "The Gadaa System"
 abba_boku_style_administration_desc: "The traditional democratic method of governance utilized by us, the Oromo people, has been relatively stable and working to bring us prosperity and unity. Under the Gadaa system, every eight years the Oromo people choose by consensus nine leaders known as 'Salgan ya'ii Borana' or, 'the nine Borana assemblies. A leader elected by the Gadaa system is only in power for eight years and the election takes place at the end of that term, and if the Abbaa Gadaa dies whilst in office, the 'bokkuu' (symbol of power) passes to his wife until the end of the term."

 settle_the_oromo_feuds_desc: "The Oromo migrations have had a debilitating affect on many people groups, including the Oromo themselves. Feuds that were once stowed away flared back up, and new disputes arose as we travelled across the land to where we are today. We must consistently work to settle these disputes and feuds or we will be ripped apart by them in time."
 the_position_of_azazi: "Utilize the Position of Azazi"
 the_position_of_azazi_desc: "The azazi (translated as 'the orderer') will be useful to us in the future, serving as one of the leaders of the administration. His position will be overseeing domestic affairs only, maintaining any and all treasuries we have, and managing finances related to the central court of Jimma itself. Such a prestigious and valuable position will attract many good people to our court, so we shall see to it that they are all vetted properly and of Oromo descent."
 more_professional_oromo_soldiers: "Professional Soldiers of the Oromo"
 more_professional_oromo_soldiers_desc: "Soldiers of our people come from all walks of life and indeed many are levied to the cause of the military without much in the way of us supplying them proper weaponry or training, but we are learning to do better from how we treat the personal guards that keep the central court and palace defended. If we can replicate their training and discipline for the likes of the common Oromo soldier, we would stand a much better chance at waging war against our neighbors."
 multi_functional_slaves: "Multi-Functional Slaves"
 multi_functional_slaves_desc: "Slaves in Jimma are not like typical slaves where they work on a plantation or in a mill day in and day out. Instead, slaves in Jimma are still of a considerably low societal clas, but they are able to serve as jailers, market judgers, stewards for the central court's territories, and many other roles. They are a valuable part of Oromo society and continuing this multi-functional role for them will help our state flourish into the future."
 affirm_oromo_might: "Affirm Oromo Might"
 affirm_oromo_might_desc: "To have survived the past was hard, but to survive the future? It could be even harder, or it could be much easier. We can't know which possibility is more likely, but we will hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Oromo people will fight to the very end to preserve the independence they fought so hard for; they will not be subjugated with ease by any surrounding power."

 JNN_ideas_start: "Djenné Traditions"
 JNN_ideas_bonus: "Djenné Ambition"
 linked_with_timbuktu: "Linked with Timbuktu"
 linked_with_timbuktu_desc: "The history of Djenné is inherently linked with the glorious trade city that is Timbuktu. We both trade in similar materials and we both have prospered because of our position near rivers. It would be wise of us to build upon this importance and develop beneficial trade relations with all of our neighbors if we are able to."
 great_mosque_of_djenne: "Great Mosque of Djenné"
 great_mosque_of_djenne_desc: "Built somewhere between 1200 and 1300 as our tradition tells us, the mosque has slowly become a center of Islamic scholarship and a beacon for traders all around us. Such a symbol of piety is rarely seen in our region and Djenné is truly blessed to have such a great building in our lands. Let us go forth and engage in the great dialogue that happens between Muslims across various regions, for all of them will be welcome in our great mosque."
 salt_gold_slave_trade: "The Salt, Gold, and Slave Trade"
 salt_gold_slave_trade_desc: "Capitalizing on the trade that our friends in Timbuktu capitalize on can bring us prosperity, right? If we work hand-in-hand with them and cooperate to entice merchants from all over the region to come to our lands, there will be few who can compete with our trade endeavors."
 island_of_djenne: "The Island of Djenné"
 island_of_djenne_desc: "Every year, the Bani and Niger rivers rise begin their seasonal flooding. From July to December, Djenne becomes something of an island and the irrigation of crops around the land becomes possible once more. We rely on this annual flood to help bring us a bit of wealth, but perhaps we can invest more into agricultural techniques that can allow for more to be grown, or different and more valuable crops to be planted."
 adapt_to_changing_trade: "Adapting to Evolving Trade"
 adapt_to_changing_trade_desc: "With coastal trade from the south and west coming into view, we need to be sure that our importance does not decline. Coastal trade is much easier for people to engage in than trade across plains and savannah so we must be ready for when we get a decrease in merchant numbers. By adapting our merchants and our own way of thinking about trade to this evolution in trade in West Africa, we can still have a fighting chance in the world of trade."
 refined_adobe_architecture: "Refine our Adobe Architecture"
 refined_adobe_architecture_desc: "Many around us know Djenné for its adobe architecture. The use of mud bricks is well known throughout West Africa and it is a common building material in drier, more arid climates (such as in Djenné) since it is relatively easy to make in large numbers and quite durable in dry conditions. By refining how adobe architecture is done in Djenné, we can reinforce our buildings so that they are stronger and also streamline the process of making mud bricks in general."
 build_upon_our_wealth: "Djenné's Wealth"
 build_upon_our_wealth_desc: "Prosperity is garnered from knowledge combined with ambition and tempered by commerce, or, at least that is what some of the wealthy merchants in Djenné say. We know that it is true to a degree and we are working to invest the profit we gain from trade and taxation so that our future prospects are much brighter. New trade depots, marvelous yet functional buildings, and prestigious mosques will all be in order for Djenné in time."
 AUS_ideas: "Australian Ideas"
 AUS_ideas_start: "Australian Traditions"
 AUS_ideas_bonus: "Australian Ambition"
 the_island_continent: "The Island Continent"
 the_island_continent_desc: "Vast and expansive, this land is something almost completely alien to the likes of where we came from originally. What this expansive land lacks in natural resources inland it more than makes up for in its plentiful places for harbors and shipyards. If we are going to survive here in Australia, we need to ensure our navy and ships are well kept and maintained."
 diverse_landscape: "Diverse Landscape"
 diverse_landscape_desc: "From rolling savannah in some places to harsh desert-like landscapes elsewhere to even enjoyable grasslands in some isolated pockets, Australia is a very intriguing and multi-faceted land. If we can get a handle on the seasonal changes and which crops best in which environment, we can start producing much more for ourselves and perhaps even others for export."
 seafaring_is_our_lifeblood: "Seafaring Ancestry"
 seafaring_is_our_lifeblood_desc: "To get to Australia, you need to have some sort of naval heritage; it's just a simple fact of this place. As a result, we have inherited the traditions of our homeland and become somewhat keen on making seafaring a crucial part of Australia as a whole. Soldiers are in demand sometimes sure, but sailors are given the lion's share of training and funding so that we can ensure our naval prowess continues to grow unhindered."
 valued_trade_with_the_indies: "Valuable Northern Trade"
 valued_trade_with_the_indies_desc: "To our direct north are the 'Spice Islands' as some call them. The various political entities there do good business with us regularly and we value their cooperation since their spices like cloves, black pepper, and cinnamon are highly valued by the Australian people. Perhaps we can even make way into the spice trade eventually since Australia's diverse landscape could be suitable for growing certain spices."
 expansive_australian_shipyards: "Expand the Shipyards"
 expansive_australian_shipyards_desc: "As time goes forth, we are settling more of the coastline and expanding our ability to make a sustainable state on this interesting island continent, but not only this, we are slowly expanding our many harbors and shipyards for increased production measures. The naval prowess of those living all the way in the vast expanses of Australia will be truly something to marvel at."
 no_time_spent_being_idle: "No Rest for the Wicked"
 no_time_spent_being_idle_desc: "Some would call us wicked and horrid for wanting to live in such a place like Australia but we do not care for such petty insults. Instead, we care for making the land we control something we can live on with security since much of the Australian wilderness can be home to hostile animals or hostile native tribes. There is never any rest for our people, no there ain't rest for the wicked."
 master_the_australian_terrain: "Master the Outback"
 master_the_australian_terrain_desc: "Once we have mastered the Australian outback and its harsh ways, we'll be able to fend off any invader wishing to come through our lands. We'll utilize both natural and man-made defenses to stop invaders from intruding on our land, and should we be able to take positions on foreign lands across some stretch of water, we'll utilize what natural defenses are there to interrupt our enemies at every turn." 
 CAM_ideas: "Central American Ideas"
 CAM_ideas_start: "Central American Traditions"
 CAM_ideas_bonus: "Central American Ambition"
 criollos: "Congress of the Criollos"
 criollos_desc: "Criollos are, to us of Central America, those of almost pure motherland descent but they were born here, and not on the far shores of what lands we once swore fealty toward. These Criollos have so far led the way in shaping how we have gained independence and we will continue to support them in their efforts to rally the populace against those who strike down at Central America's unified provinces."
 stave_off_bloodshed: "Less Bloodshed, More Unity"
 stave_off_bloodshed_desc: "Regardless of how bloody our path to indepence was, we need to stand tall and above what pools of blood are in our past. Abstaining from needless bloodshed in our administration and facilitating shared bonds of common identity is what these provinces of Central America need, not consistent tyranny and harsh treatment from petty overlords."
 liberal_minded_locals: "Liberal Minded Locals"
 liberal_minded_locals_desc: "Not only is our congress and administration liberal minded, but so are our locals to a great degree. They have taken the lessons given to them (both harshly and graciously) by our former overlords and come to develop a very unique and liberal way of thinking that few states around us can claim to have or even imitate. Whilst it may cause tenion in the future due to political debate and intrigue, we should take some of these ideas up when we can and not stunt their growth in the slightest."
 resolve_regional_disputes: "Resolving Regional Differences"
 resolve_regional_disputes_desc: "If there is one thing that has been plaguing the administration of these united provinces, it is the fact that regional differences between various communities keep rising up without end and causing endless factionalism from the ground up. If we are going to instill any sort of lasting faith in our officials and their capabilities, we need to establish more efficient and thorough laws and regulations for keeping the various communities of ours in check."
 proper_city_connections: "Proper Communication Networks"
 proper_city_connections_desc: "To better facilitate travel and communication between not only the communities of Central America, but also the different provincial offices and such, we will institute a sort of fixed road system complete with mapping and plans for a postal service. If we can do this in an effective and timely fashion, not only will civilians be able to get around and communicate faster, but our military will be able to do exactly the same and so will our own officials."
 constitutional_reforms: "Open to Reformation"
 constitutional_reforms_desc: "What would be if we were not open to change? Our former overlords refused to go along with what changes we wanted for ourselves, so now that we have the torch of independece on our side, we can and will be open to reforming our legal system and administration in whichever way we see fit."
 united_provinces_in_reality: "Truly United Provinces"
 united_provinces_in_reality_desc: "In the end, we will see to it that we stay united no matter the cost. We cannot risk being divided in the face of our former colonial masters regaining power they once had, or new colonial masters seeking viable land in Central America. When our administration from the top down is effective and efficient, all other matters will in place for the United Provinces of Central America."
 COL_ideas: "Colombian Ideas"
 COL_ideas_start: "Colombian Traditions"
 COL_ideas_bonus: "Colombian Ambition"
 history_of_previous_rebel_sentiment: "History of Rebel Sentiment"
 history_of_previous_rebel_sentiment_desc: "Since our land was colonized, we have had to deal with separtist sentiments interally. Thankfully we have become fairly ruthless and good at rooting out these rebellious sentiments and have grown to be able to make Colombia a much more stable place, or, well, a place that is safe internally."
 indigenous_assistance: "Indigenous Assistance"
 indigenous_assistance_desc: "The local people of the land are quite fierce in their fighting, though they were slowly overcome by our forces when we were still and a young colony. Now that we can utilize indigenous people in what ways we deem fit, it would be best to incorporate them into the Colombian military system in an equal fashion so that they can contribute to any and all war efforts we are in."
 balance_liberals_and_conservatives: "Balancing Liberals and Conservatives"
 balance_liberals_and_conservatives_desc: "With the coming of our independence, we have had a number of groups proposing various ideas for Colombia to go for. Liberal ideas, conservative ideas, they are all tempting but we cannot risk alienating one part of the nation if we go for one path. We must work to find a balance between both strains of thought in Colombia."
 martial_skill_from_our_parents: "Retain Martial Prowess"
 martial_skill_from_our_parents_desc: "Our former overlords were keen on one thing when they colonized this land: military prowess. It is how they were able to best the natives and subjugate the entirety of the land. If we wish to stay on top of things in Colombia and be prepared for external as well as internal threats, we need to make sure our military is prepared."
 colombian_coasts: "Colombian Coasts"
 colombian_coasts_desc: "The coasts of Colombia are places of great trade and places of various meetings between people, but they are always somewhat vulnerable due to our lack of shipyards and docks. If we can perhaps invest some more time and money into our coastline, we'll make sure that our trade hubs are much safer."
 hill_and_jungle_warfare: "Fights in Colombian Land"
 hill_and_jungle_warfare_desc: "If one is to fight in the heartlands of Colombia, one is asking to fight amidst humid rains and rough terrain. What kind of soldier is able to do such a thing for more than a little while? Why, only Colombians of course, which is why we have learned to adapt our fighting style to this kind of landscape."
 in_union_and_in_peace_with_each_other: "In Union and Peace"
 in_union_and_in_peace_with_each_other_desc: "If there is one thing we of Colombia strive for, it is this: To be in union and peace with each other. It certainly is a lofty goal considering how chaotic international politics can be, but we must make an effort to enforce law and order in the vast expanses of Colombia before we start reaching out to other domains for conquest or to liberate fellow colonial states."
 CAL_ideas: "Californian Ideas"
 CAL_ideas_start: "Californian Traditions"
 CAL_ideas_bonus: "Californian Ambition"
 mythical_past_of_california: "A Mythical Past"
 mythical_past_of_california_desc: "Our founders from the far off shores shared many tales of California's foundation in myths and legends. Great figures walking our landscape, wondrous and grand cities dotting the coastline and such, but reality is sadly not as grand as myths let on. Still, Californians bask in this foundation in myths and legends; it is part of what makes California, well, California."
 abundance_of_food_yearround: "An Abundance of Food"
 abundance_of_food_yearround_desc: "Without agriculture there is still a great amount of food available in California. The natives that lived in these lands before we arrived thrived off of the natural landscape itself without agriculture. If we can learn to be as resourceful as them in finding food, we can support a far greater population than what our ancestors thought was possible."
 come_to_peace_with_native_californians: "Come to Peace"
 come_to_peace_with_native_californians_desc: "Whilst we are becoming more and more numerous year after year, the native Californian tribes and people still hold a good portion of land that we should not just brush off to the side. Making peace and cooperating with them is what can make or break California altogether. If there is internal unity within our nation, few can come between us and greatness."
 the_problem_of_agriculture: "The Problem of Agriculture"
 the_problem_of_agriculture_desc: "As more and more people come to California to settle down, and as more and more Californians come into being through marriages and having children, there will be a need to develop agriculture on a large scale. Farm estates and such are going to need to be cultivated for our growing population and by starting now as opposed to later, we'll be ahead of the curve come future decades and centuries."
 tame_the_rugid_inlands: "The Rugged Californian Wilds"
 tame_the_rugid_inlands_desc: "California is a land of many shifting landscapes. From grasslands to forests to hills and deserts, we have it all to some degree and we need to learn how to master these terrain types with both civilian settlements and military soldiers. Building fortifications in crucial places of varying terrain types can help train our soldiers and also improve communication speeds all around the likes of our vast and beautiful land."
 the_advantage_of_bays: "Californian Bays"
 the_advantage_of_bays_desc: "Coasts are as important to California as gold is to global trade. We thrive off trade and through our natural harbors and bays, we'd be foolish not to! If we build up these cities that are near these natural bays and harbors, we'll be an income greater than what our former masters thought was feasible for California."
 the_gold_rush: "Gold?"
 the_gold_rush_desc: "There are interesting reports of gold deposits being found in various parts of California's interior and whilst we cannot verify most of these findings and reports, the ones we can verify can serve to attract a great many settlers and miners to our land. They'll pay as much as they need to get in and start mining for gold, so why not make money off of this influx of possible future businessmen?"

 LOU_ideas_start: "Lousianian Traditions"
 LOU_ideas_bonus: "Lousianian Ambition"
 hostile_encounters_along_the_mississippi: "Hostilities by our River"
 hostile_encounters_along_the_mississippi_desc: "Whether at the river itself or nearby at its banks, we have had several hostile encounters that have trained our military to be keenly aware of how to handle the great river we reside upon. Cavalry and artillery take a less prominent role when fighting near the great river and infantry are at the heart of the fighting and it is because of this that our men are some of the most resilient in the region."
 regular_river_crossing: "Regular River Crossings"
 regular_river_crossing_desc: "Crossing the great Mississippi River is no easy task for a commander or general, but it can certainly be done with enough supplies and effort. We need to be training our future commanders to navigate river crossings both small and large with ease so that they are able to use river crossings either to their advantage or nullify the major effect it might have on a battle they're engaged in."
 starting_of_plantations: "Plantations of Louisiana"
 starting_of_plantations_desc: "Agriculture in Louisiana, especially southward toward the open sea, is hard to cultivate since marshland and swampy terrain is just not suitable for widescale farms and plantations. We need to open up tracts of land in the more hospitable areas of Louisiana and begin the construction of proper plantations and farm estates so that we can start producing food on a large scale. Perhaps in time, we'll start growing other goods too on the new plantations."
 sustainable_harbors: "Sustainable Harbors"
 sustainable_harbors_desc: "In order to have a proper navy, we are going to need suitable harbors and shipyards. This wouldn't be an issue in most other coastal places, but for Louisiana and its wetlands, we need to get creative with our harbors and shipyards. We will need to engineer some well-built structures that can be used on less-than-ideal terrain and once we obtain some good coastal lands, we need to ensure that our harbors and shipyards there are also built in a very similar fashion."
 vie_for_gulf_control: "The Battles for the Gulf"
 vie_for_gulf_control_desc: "Controlling the trade in the gulf to our immediate south is a priority of ours since a lot of our trade comes through there. If we can secure it with our own ships and fend off hostile powers, both other independent nations of the New World and old nations from beyond the ocean, we will be in a grand position to command all the trade around us."
 the_marshland_masters: "Marshland Masters"
 the_marshland_masters_desc: "What fighting we've done and what civil cultivation of the land we've done in the harsh terrain of Louisiana has trained us to be resilient and hardworking people. Our former colonial masters may think of us as little upstarts who need to get back in line eventually, but we'll show them just how wrong they are about the Lousianian people. Let them land on our shores, and let them drown in their own blood mixed with the water."
 harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river: "The Mississippi River"
 harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river_desc: "The great Mississippi River is a very defining feature of the region we reside in and it is perhaps the key defining factor about Louisiana itself. So many people depend on it for their own lives and for making money off of trade, we would be fools to try to close it down to only ourselves. We should be attracting any and all merchants that we can and invite them in so that they too can share in the glory of the mighty Mississippi River."
 LAP_ideas: "Argentine Ideas"

 LAP_ideas_bonus: "Argentine Ambition"
 cattle_raising_tradition: "Cattle Raising Tradition"
 cattle_raising_tradition_desc: "The lands of Argentina are not ripe for large plantations and farm estates, nor are they good for mining minerals from the earth. Instead, they are good for raising cattle and livestock, which we take a degree of pride in now that we are independent. By keeping this central facet of Argentine society going, we can sustain a growing population over the coming years."
 establish_the_office_of_supreme_director: "Establish the Office of Supreme Director"
 establish_the_office_of_supreme_director_desc: "We cannot have a single cadre of individuals holding power over the nation who are in power because of their status and wealth alone. We need an elected council of people and on top of that, someone to lead Argentina into the future. The new elections of the future shall henceforth not proclaim a 'viceroy' some colonial title, they will be the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of Argentina."
 confederation_vs_federation: "Confederation, or Federation?"
 confederation_vs_federation_desc: "Many within Argentina debate as to how the provinces should be governed from the central administrative body and roughly they fall into two categories: Unitarians and Federalists. Whether we choose the path of confederation as endorsed by the Unitarians, or a federal system as proposed by the Federalists, we will need to defend Argentina from outside threats and colonial powers attempting to snuff out the fires of Argentine liberty."
 defeat_secessionits_movements: "Defeat Secessionist Movements"
 defeat_secessionits_movements_desc: "Argentina is not a uniform and neat nation that can be easily governed, not at all. There are disputes in several places that need to be mediated and settled if any progress is going to be done toward developing the nation as a whole, and those who would secede from Argentina will know no mercy from us."
 settle_federalist_vs_centralist_disputes: "Argentine Political Landscape"
 settle_federalist_vs_centralist_disputes_desc: "The politics of our young nation are turbulent and fiery, but what does one expect from being founded upon the fires of war against an former colonial overlord? We are going to need to look toward easing tensions between various political factions and ensuring that the governing body in Argentina is capable of handling corruption in whatever form it takes."
 suppress_counter_revolutionaries: "Suppress Counter-revolutionary Zeal"
 suppress_counter_revolutionaries_desc: "Some say it is not possible, but reality is so rarely what we want it to be. There are some who would indeed rise up against Argentina and return it to the greedy hands of our former colonial overlords. These counter-revolutionaries are some of the worst threats to Argentina and we will need to fight them off at every turn when they rise up. They lack the faith that others do in an independent Argentina; we will show they just how wrong they are."
 watch_for_caudillos: "Watch for Caudillos"
 watch_for_caudillos_desc: "Caudillos, a taboo word of sorts in our land. It stands for militarist politician who seeks to govern from the top down according to his will and those with unflinching loyalty to him. We need to watch for these abhorrent people rising up in the ranks of the Argetine administration, for if they have their way with the government, the entire dream of an independent and unified Argentina could easily collapse in on itself."

 the_enemies_within_chile: "Defeating the Royalists"
 the_enemies_within_chile_desc: "Those who cling to the power of our former colonial overlords, the Royalists as they are known as, are a consistent threat to Chile's independence. We must take a torch and burn this mold off of Chile's pride and greatness! We cannot and will not go back to the likes of our former overlords! Chile will be free!"
 the_enemies_outside_chile: "Securing against Royalists"
 the_enemies_outside_chile_desc: "Royalists are not bound to just Chile's interior, but rather they are spread far and wide beyond Chile's borders. We need to ensure that the entire nation is rallied against these oppressive people who would rather live under tyranny instead of fighting for freedom."
 chilean_finances: "Chilean Finances"
 chilean_finances_desc: "Chile has had to struggle with had financial times for a while since the lands of Chile are not blessed with great wealth like those in other parts of South America. This struggle has helped Chilean economists and financiers learn how to minimize spending and maximize profit for what little good land we have, and more importantly they have learned how to streamline military spending so that there is little in the way of wasted funds."
 establish_chilean_schooling: "To be Educated"
 establish_chilean_schooling_desc: "What our officials know better than anyone else around us is that an educated populace is a more well-off populace. Social mobility can be had more easily with education and as such Chilean schools and libraries need to be promoted whenever possible. Building new ones in our largest cities and radiating out from there will be a fine start."
 appeal_to_tolerance_not_tradition: "Who Needs a State Religion?"
 appeal_to_tolerance_not_tradition_desc: "Chile's foundation may be steeped in the fires of colonial independence movements, but Chile must also think about its future and not simply be stuck in the past. Previously we saw state religions enforced everywhere we looked, but does Chile truly need a state religion? We must be more liberal minded about this and appeal more to tolerance as opposed to tradition, for that (being more liberal minded) is what helped us gain independence in the first place."
 spearhead_liberal_ideas: "Spearheading Liberal Ideas"
 spearhead_liberal_ideas_desc: "The mindset of being liberal with many things in life is alien to many of our former overlords, but in Chile, it is widely embraced. There are some who critique us for how we think and live life what with it being much more liberal in nature as opposed to what traditions we come from, but we will greet these critiques with thought-provoking debate and discussion, not swords and weapons."
 balance_the_political_scales: "Balance the Scales"
 balance_the_political_scales_desc: "As the political landscape in Chile develops, there is a real threat that disputes in politics could erupt into civil conflicts that involve armies moving against each other. We need to attempt to balance out those with more conservative views and those with more liberal views inside the Chilean government so that they don't tear each other apart when debates rise up."

 the_gran_chaco: "The Gran Chaco"
 the_gran_chaco_desc: "The Gran Chaco region of Paraguay is an interesting and productive region that can hold mixed situations for our economy. It is good for cattle raising but is only somewhat alright for farming, so we must carefully choose how to utilize its potential since its natural terrain will bolster the production of most whatever we choose to grow there."
 intermarry_and_intermix: "Befriend and Intermarry with Natives"
 intermarry_and_intermix_desc: "The others around us might see fit to fire at and cut down the native people of the land, but we of Paraguay see absolutely no need for this. They are integral to the land and were here before us; they deserve degrees of respect and dignity above that of slavery. We will ensure their protection and integration into Paraguay and our nation will be stronger because of it."
 defend_against_foreign_raids: "Foreign Raids!"
 defend_against_foreign_raids_desc: "The land of Paraguay is naturally divided by rivers part of the time, but that does not stop foreign people coming across our border and raiding villages and towns. We need to bolster our defenses and improve how many of our people are able to wield muskets properly. Native or mixed race, if they can fire a musket and swear loyalty to Paraguay's defense, we'll need them." 
 native_allies_of_paraguay: "Repaid in Full"
 native_allies_of_paraguay_desc: "WIth our treatment of the native people being different to those around us, we have seen a mixed reaction in Paraguay ranging from acceptance to resistance. Regardless of this, the cooperation and intermarrying with native people has garnered us lasting and good relations with many native tribes to the point of being able to rely on them in times of war."
 reforming_the_paraguayan_economy: "Reformation of the Economy"
 reforming_the_paraguayan_economy_desc: "Independence for Paraguay is a tricky matter since our region is not the most profitable nor the most valuable. We must become more financially responsible and fiscally viable so that the economy of Paraguay can be in consistent growth rather than stagnation or decline, and how do we do this? Through active reform efforts ranging from coinage reforms to trade policy revisions."
 legacy_of_the_open_cabildo: "Legacy of the Open Cabildo"
 legacy_of_the_open_cabildo_desc: "What equates to an 'Open Town Hall', the Open Cabildo is partially what helped Paraguay gain its independence. Locally rooted efforts that slowly rose up the ranks to the administration and such, it is these town halls that we need to continue to have in Paraguay to help regulate the administration down to the community level."
 cultivate_paraguays_heart: "Cultivate the Heart of Paraguay"
 cultivate_paraguays_heart_desc: "At the end of the day, Paraguay is the little nation of South America and needs to rely more on itself than others for improvement. It is possible though it will not be easy to do this, but if we can manage to pull through tumultuous politics and stave off foreign invasions, the administration of Paraguay will be one of the highest functioning ones in South America."

 backbone_of_the_andes: "Backbone of the Andes Mountains"
 backbone_of_the_andes_desc: "The great Andes Mountains, what a marvelous and treacherous natural feature they are! And how gracious of nature to grant Peru such a formidable natural defensive mechanism. Any enemies who dare try to invade Peru's heartland will be left wanting as the high peaks and rough inclines and declines punish even the most valiant regiment of soldiers, cavalry, and cannons."
 settle_with_the_various_natives: "Settle with the Natives"
 settle_with_the_various_natives_desc: "The native people of Peru are fierce in their fighting and numerous in their communities. We cannot hope to survive as a functional state if we do not cooperate with them on a number of levels. Thus, we need to integrate them both into the economy and into the military of Peru instead of being at constant war with them."
 extracting_minerals: "Extracting Peruvian Minerals"
 extracting_minerals_desc: "The mountains of Peru are lucrative and full of resources that can be extracted... If one is daring enough to brave the sides of the steep Andes Mountains, that is. Intrepid and valiant Peruvian workers are suited for this task though, since they know the terrain well and are properly equipped to excavate what ores and minerals lie beneath our feet."
 rising_tide_of_liberty: "The Tide of Liberty"
 rising_tide_of_liberty_desc: "Liberty is something Peruvians have desired for a long while, but it was out of reach for so many years. Alas, our day had finally come and gone and revolutionary fervor peaked when our independence was at hand, but what now? We cannot let that flame of liberty just die away, we must keep the torch lit so that other nations of the Americas may follow our path! We can help our brothers and sisters across the continent be free from colonial oppression!"
 natural_peruvian_fortifications: "Natural Fortifications"
 natural_peruvian_fortifications_desc: "Utilizing the Andes Mountains is part of our defensive military doctrine is certainly a plus, but building modern fortifications into or on the mountains themselves can really cut down on fortification maintenance. If they're designed just right, some parts of our fortresses won't even need to be manned!"
 pacific_bound_trade: "Pacific Ocean Traders"
 pacific_bound_trade_desc: "The Pacific Ocean is lucrative for trade, especially since vessels capable of faring the large swaths of water are becoming very common. Investing in the ports on Peru's coast will undoubtedly bolster the trade sector since we are one of the major Pacific Ocean traders in the Americas already."
 center_at_the_city_of_kings: "Proclaim the City of Kings"
 center_at_the_city_of_kings_desc: "Our, nicknamed by locals as the 'City of Kings' may be a bit strange considering our liberal ideas about governance and our independence war itself, but its name symbolizes the crowning of a city to rule over Peru and all of its inhabitants, both indigenous and not. It will be a glorious city upheld by citizens and politicians alike, and none shall tear it down."

 utilize_the_venezuelan_coasts_desc: "We are blessed with viable coasts that can harbor both growing settlements and docks for our growing fleet. In the future, we should work toward projecting Venezuelan power outward via a continuous building up of our fleet and dockyards."
 cocoa_plantations: "Cocoa Plantations"
 cocoa_plantations_desc: "The lands of Venezuela are not ripe for growing every kind of crop, but if there is one particular crop that we can grow in excess for the world market, it is cocoa. By encouraging plantations of cocoa to be brought up and managed effectively, we can expand our influence in the various markets around the world that crave cocoa."
 the_cabildos_of_venezuela: "Let the Communities be Heard"
 the_cabildos_of_venezuela_desc: "The local gatherings of people called 'cabildos' are in essence town/city councils. Such local councils helped Venezuela gain its independence and should continue to be utilized in the governance of Venezuela so that locals can always be heard."
 thirst_for_knowledge: "Thirst for Knowledge"
 thirst_for_knowledge_desc: "Due to our location, we are in a good location to garner information from the lands of Europe and Africa and we have an easier time facilitating travel to both places. As such, the wealthier people of Venezuela have a lust for knowledge that must be quenched as we go forth; schools, libraries, and universities throughout Venezuela should be able to satiate this desire."
 work_through_racial_divides: "Racial Divides in Venezuela"
 work_through_racial_divides_desc: "The colonial past of Venezuela is not filled with purely wholesome times since we inherited much of what our former overlords did in their own land. One particularly hard subject is that of racial divides that are now being brought to the surface of Venezuelan politics, and as we go forth into the future, we will need to address them via legislative measures and steady administrative reforms."
 royalists_in_venezuela: "Defeat the Royalists"
 royalists_in_venezuela_desc: "Royalist sentiment is something we cannot bare to stand in Venezuela. Royalists are spread beyond our borders and throughout various communities of ours and at times, they feel that they can overthrow the governing body of Venezuela. We will show them just how righteous our authority is, and just how disciplined one must be in order to win over the hearts and minds of Venezuelans."
 charting_out_a_venezuelan_future: "A Sustainable Future"
 charting_out_a_venezuelan_future_desc: "The future is shrouded in fog to all, but none more so that Venezuela. If we are to make a sustainable and prosperous future for our people, we must look at our own cities and towns and see what they need. Once we can provide our own people the infrastructure they strive for, we will then be able to extend a firm hand of friendship to those beyond our borders."

 HAT_ideas_bonus: "Haitian Ambition"
 valued_exports_of_haiti: "Valued Exports"
 valued_exports_of_haiti_desc: "Haiti is prized for its exports since it is readily able to produce vast quantities of sugar and other resources if plantations and farm estates are set up. Whilst some may not like this fact, we must embrace it and begin trading in what made us valuable in the first place so that the Haitian economy can thrive."
 knowledge_of_raids_and_privateering: "Raiding and Privateering"
 knowledge_of_raids_and_privateering_desc: "Since our path to independence, the Haitian people (civilians and soldiers alike) have observed the uncouth ways of conducting warfare around us. Raiding on land and at sea and taking off before the enemy can catch you, it's dishonorable and harsh in all the right ways! These tactics that we employed in our fight for independence should become regular strategies we use in whatever battle we find ourselves in!"
 lucrative_plantations_of_haiti: "Once Profitable, Still Profitable"
 lucrative_plantations_of_haiti_desc: "Though our independence brought a slight drop in economic activity around Haitian land and Haitian coasts, we are very much still a profitable nation. Refining and fixing up the plantations, diversifying the crops we grow, and implementing modernizing economic reforms over the coming decades wil help bring life back into the Haitian economy."
 implementing_revolutionary_ideals: "New Ideals for a New State"
 implementing_revolutionary_ideals_desc: "The ideas we espoused during our bid for independence were roundly criticized and rejected by our former colonial masters, but they have no say in our administration anymore now do they? We can implement the new ideals our scholars and officers had in mind and become something of a bastion of liberty to the regions near us."
 hardened_from_fighting_for_freedom: "Disciplined for Liberty"
 hardened_from_fighting_for_freedom_desc: "Haitian soldiers have not lost the tenacity and discipline they had from the skirmishes and pitched battles we fought against our former colonial overlord. They fought with what we modern weapons and modern tactics and the utmost discipline and we will strive to maintain that zeal in our military going forward."
 securing_trade_in_the_caribbean: "Securing the Caribbean"
 securing_trade_in_the_caribbean_desc: "If we cannot ensure that our coastal waters are safe, Haiti is a nation exposed and naked to outside invasions from any direction! We must have a sustainable fleet that can protect our trade routes and our coasts. Our soldiers on land are already prepared to fight and die for our continued independence, but is our navy ready?"
 never_let_our_guard_down: "Never Let Our Guard Down"
 never_let_our_guard_down_desc: "Constatnly on guard; ever vigilant for reprisal attacks from hungry colonial powers. Haiti needs a strong standing army and navy to keep itself safe and to help protect the liberty that we fought so hard for in the past. Formal officer and admiral ranks, proper payments to sailors and soldiers, it is all part of making Haiti a power that can sustain itself when no others are around to help."

 cheran_cholan_pandyan: "The Three Crowned Kings"
 cheran_cholan_pandyan_desc: "The old triumvirate of Chera, Chola, and Pandya dominated politics in ancient Tamilakam. We know them today as 'Moovendhar' or, 'Three Crowned Rulers', 'Three Glorified by Heaven, and also 'World of the Three'. All three played pivotal roles in the development of Tamilakam into a thriving region full of trade, prosperity, and culture, though all three also contributed to many great conflicts that occurred in the region. Now that the region is united once more, we may set out with the backing of our own people and the blessing of our ancestors."
 chera_spice_trade_connections: "Spice Trade Connections"
 chera_spice_trade_connections_desc: "The Chera, though first to decline out of the three powers, was in large part the spice trading power of the three. Once holding power in the coastal area of Kerala, they thrived off incoming traders from the north and west since they all desired the wondrous spices produced on the coast. We'd do well to pick up where they left off without hesitation since we could always use the trade money for great things."
 chera_wootz_steel: "Legacy of Wootz Steel"
 chera_wootz_steel_desc: "Wootz Steel was a particular kind of strong steel from the lands of the Chera. Being exported almost solely by them, it was this steel that was said to be 'the finest steel in the world' by various Roman, Egyptian, Chinese, and Arab sources. Utilizing Wootz Steel today and refining it over time will give the Tamil people an undeniable edge in combat, and instructing them properly on how to use such high-quality material will be key for us."
 chola_naval_expeditions: "New Naval Expeditions"
 chola_naval_expeditions_desc: "To prepare for conquests as great as our ancestors of the Chola Empire, we must expand our fleet to sizes unmatched by our neighbors. Recruiting sailors and admirals as well as building new and improved ships will all be part of our ongoing effort to rule the waters of the vast ocean waters around us."
 chola_grand_invasions: "Grand Invasions"
 chola_grand_invasions_desc: "The legacy of the Chola Empire lies not only in naval battles and invasions from the water, but it also lies in conquest on land. They carved out an empire vast enough to stretch into the Deccan and challenged the once mighty Chalukya Empire for hegemony, meaning that we too have a duty to seek out lands throughout the heart of India."
 pandyan_surviving_and_still_fighting: "Survived the Past"
 pandyan_surviving_and_still_fighting_desc: "The Pandyas survived from ancient times until the 1400s, surging and then collapsing time after time again. Their legacy is a grand one like that of the Chola Empire, though their prowess did not lie in conquest. Their tenacity and will to survive for such a long time in the face of bleak and harrowing times is what we must learn from; a military that is ready to face such times is what we will need."
 pandyan_reassemble_the_sangams: "Reassemble the Sangams"
 pandyan_reassemble_the_sangams_desc: "The legendary Sangams (also known as 'the Academies') were gatherings of scholars under Pandya influence. Whilst the first two Sangams may be mythical at best, the Third Sangam that was seated in Madurai was established some 1850 years before Christianity emerged and gathered some 449 poets to create some of the greatest and most well remembered works of Tamil literature. As we go forth, we shall create a new Sangam and patronize Tamil literature as much as we can so that our cultural continues to thrive like never before."

 sca_dockyards_of_scandinavia_desc: "What would Scandinavia be without its great dockyards and viable ports? Absolutely nothing, that is what! Since our time of dominance in the Viking Age to right now, the people of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark have been able to field great numbers of ships for battle and trade, and even the Sapmi and Finnish people helped contribute to this effort. We will be sure that in the future we will always have room for a grand fleet that can challenge any of our rivals."
 sca_religious_fervor_in_the_north: "Scandinavian Religiosity"
 sca_religious_fervor_in_the_north_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has broken ties of kinship and friendship all throught the heart of Europe and even in Scandinavia, people were shaken to their very core by the questions posed by Martin Luther and his followers. We should not let these questions stall us forever though, for we Scandinavians can decide for ourselves what path is truly the righteous one. We will lead our people through the fires of religious conflict and see a brighter tomorrow... Perhaps one free from heretics as well."
 sca_dominate_the_baltic: "Baltic Domination"
 sca_dominate_the_baltic_desc: "The Baltic Sea is a dangerous one by some standards. In previous eras it was dominated by the Hanseatic League stemming from Northern Germany, but Scandinavians as well as Russians have always had a hand in Baltic trade as well. Now that Scandinavia is united, we should be putting forth our merchants and mercantile fleets all throughout the Baltic to secure more and more trade for ourselves, denying our rivals of the valuable income that stems from the trade routes in what should be referred to as the 'Scandinavian Sea'."
 sca_reformation_administration: "Modernize Scandinavia"
 sca_reformation_administration_desc: "Feudalism is at its end in many parts of Europe, though unjust monarchs and bishops would see to it that the old social order is maintained despite what new advances there are in governance and what new ideas are spreading throughout all of Europe. Scandinavia shall not be one that clings to the feudal past and will instead look to the future, shaping its administrative body to match incoming ideas regarding how to deal with politics, diplomacy, and military matters."
 sweden_manage_the_estates: "Manage the Estates"
 sweden_manage_the_estates_desc: "The various estates that have large powerbases throughout core Swedish land are crucial to the survival of all of Scandinavia. Whilst we can contend easily with Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Sapmi estates, the Swedish estates continually wield considerable power that we must strive to balance in the coming ages."
 sweden_caroleans: "Enter: The Caroleans"
 sweden_caroleans_desc: "The manpower and resources of Scandinavia as a whole are not like those of the Holy Roman Empire, France, or the Ottoman Empire. We must learn to innovate and make do with what we already do have and extract all that we can and more from our soldiers. Thus, our military strategies and battle tactics are going to need to take a turn toward offense instead of defense, trading pure staying power through sheer numbers for professional and disciplined men of great caliber, and the Swedish sector of Scandinavia will help lead this charge into a new military era."
 sweden_absolutism_from_stockholm: "From Stockholm, Outwards"
 sweden_absolutism_from_stockholm_desc: "There are various cities and towns throughout Scandinavia that strive for their own distinguished identity and autonomy from the crown in Stockholm, but can we really allow this to stand? Monarchs may indeed be checked by the people they rule over, but the entirety of the administration needs to have its laws heard and followed by every town and city of significant standing within Scandinavia's borders. We will be sure that local authorities have clear access to the precise legislation that is passed by our government in Stockholm."
 norway_north_sea_sailors: "North Sea Sailors"
 norway_north_sea_sailors_desc: "Our endless expeditions across the North Sea and far beyond toward Iceland and Greenland are the stuff of legends, but the legends are a reality that is shrouded in the sands of time. Norwegian people though, unlike those of Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and the far north, are much more adept at sailing through the open waters. Whether it is because of our innate love for the open waters or our strategic homeland position along the North Sea, the bulk of our great sailors will hail from Norwegian cities and they will lead us toward glory."
 norway_legacy_of_the_longship: "Legacy of the Longship"
 norway_legacy_of_the_longship_desc: "The most infamous vessel from the Viking Age is that which is called the longship. Longships were crafted specifically toward the environment they were going to be sailing in and also could be used as steady platforms for man-to-man fighting on the open water. Their grand design and high value back then gives all of Scandinavia something to look back upon, and most importantly it gives the Norwegian engineers and shipbuilders inspiration to innovate on current ship designs so that our future fleets will be sturdier and more robust than anything our foes can muster."
 norway_premier_fleet_of_the_world: "The Premier Fleet of Scandinavia"
 norway_premier_fleet_of_the_world_desc: "Whilst the English in the Isles may think of themselves as the greatest naval power there can be, Norwegians being aided by their fellow Swedes, Finns, Sapmi, and Danish kin are quickly growing strong enough to challenge the English and any others major naval power. Our fleet is the pride and the heart of Scandinavia and it will be what brings a new era of greatness and glory to all of Scandinavia."
 denmark_kalmar_union_lessons: "Memory of the Kalmar Union"
 denmark_kalmar_union_lessons_desc: "The Kalmar Union, started in 1397 via the efforts of Queen Margaret I of Denmark and Eric of Pomerania, was a pivotal moment in the history of Scandinavia as a whole. None could have envisioned what it would do to shape our politics and foreign relations, but it succeeded in its main goal: stopping German expansion northward into the Baltic Sea and into Scandinavian lands. The union as a whole was not smooth though, and there were many issues between the three main people groups of the union that eventually pulled it apart from every possible angle. We will learn from this period in our history and institute reforms so that a union like it will never fall apart again."
 denmark_the_legacy_of_cnut: "Legacy of Cnut the Great"
 denmark_the_legacy_of_cnut_desc: "Denmark's history of attempting to unite Scandinavia and beyond stretches back not only to the days of the Kalmar Union, but back to the days of Cnut the Great. Trying to unify the lands of Scandinavia and the Isles is a monumental task and the failure of Cnut's successors is shameful, but valuable in what it left behind: a legacy of conquest. The blood of the Danish people is not satisfied with simply being the leading part of Scandinavia, no, it strives to expand outward and to retake what rightfully belongs to Scandinavian people and more!"
 denmark_commandeer_trade: "Scandinavia's Fair Cut"
 denmark_commandeer_trade_desc: "Though we are extremely fond of the Sound Toll that has been contested by Germans across the northern coast for ages, we will need to commandeer more trade routes and markets to enforce Scandinavian influence in more places; this alongside increasing the wealth flowing into our treasury too. Once more places of trade are secured, we can bolster the value in these places through setting up prominent networks of traders and merchants whilst also establishing firm relations with nearby neighboring lands (if they're not hostile to us, that is)."
 finland_hakkapeliitat: "Hakkapeliitta! Cut Them Down!"
 finland_hakkapeliitat_desc: "Though we may resent the Swedish people to a fair degree for past slights against us, the military arm of the Finnish people have taken up the military initiative that the Swedish seem to naturally have. The development of light cavalry is slowly taken root in Finnish ranks in the Scandinavian military, and the motto that these light cavalry regiments put forth, 'hakkaa päälle!' ('Cut them down!'), is exactly what they're excelling at: swift and ruthless charges against the enemy, brutal yet precise raids, and ingenius scouting for military maneuvers."
 finland_listen_to_the_peasantry: "Listen to the Peasants"
 finland_listen_to_the_peasantry_desc: "The peasants are often not represented fairly in Scandinavia for a myriad of reasons, but in Finnish lands, peasants have held a slightly higher status and wield slightly more power than they do in the lands of the Swedish, Danish, or Norwegians. Why is this? It is because we know that they too have ideas and thoughts that need to be heard just like those of the nobility and the merchants of Scandinavia. Extending this mindset across our government can and will help make it more flexible and able to address the concerns of many people groups inside our borders."
 finland_extensive_defenses: "Ice and Stone"
 finland_extensive_defenses_desc: "Whilst the White Death is what keeps the lands of Scandinavia's northern sector fairly secure, it is the job of staunch fortifications like the one at Viborg to hold off enemies in warmer climates. If we can build stronger and more extensive defenses throughout Scandinavia whilst also utilizing the seasons to our advantage, there will be no nation in the world that can penetrate beyond just a couple provinces into Scandinavia's heartland."
 sapmi_swift_movements: "Swift Movements"
 sapmi_swift_movements_desc: "If there is one thing that the Sapmi people of the north have instilled into the hearts and minds of the military officers of Scandinavia, it is that fast and precise movement is absolutely crucial. The Land of the Midnight Sun has no mercy on those who wait too long and the same rule applies to enemies in war. Mobility will be the largest factor in driving military success for Scandinavians."
 sapmi_noaidi_traditions: "The Noaidi Traditions"
 sapmi_noaidi_traditions_desc: "The fires of religious war in Europe's heart is a raging inferno that the Sapmi have wanted no part in. The noaidi, Sapmi shamans who are the religious heads of the polytheisitic Sapmi religion, bring a much needed example of tolerance in the times of religious turmoil. We can look to them for guidance and learn to accept other faiths into the fold of Scandinavia without compromising its ability to govern or defend itself from invasions."
 sapmi_fairness_to_nomads_and_settlers: "Equality to Nomads and Settlers"
 sapmi_fairness_to_nomads_and_settlers_desc: "Many of the Sapmi people are content with their semi-nomadic reindeer herding in the far north of Scandinavia. Though some Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish officials think it would be better if we forced these semi-nomadic people to settle down, we realize that it is in the best interest of Scandinavia if they keep to their own and are treated fairly under the government. They can help keep order in their own parts of Scandinavia if they are treated fairly and we will ensure that there is a permanent peace between the nomads and settlers of Scandinavia."
 ice_ruthless_fleet: "The Ruthless Fleet"
 ice_ruthless_fleet_desc: "The fleets of Scandinavia that dock not only in the cold ports of Iceland and the warmer ports along the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian coast knows no bounds. Shaped from having to fend off countless commerce raids and various conflicts throughout the North Sea and elsewhere, the fleet of Scandinavia will be like no other, for when one ship falls in battle, it only grows more bolder in its actions in the heat of things."
 ice_norse_endurance: "Norse Endurance"
 ice_norse_endurance_desc: "If we can endure the cold weather of Scandinavia stretching from the Land of the Midnight Sun all the way to Icelandic mountains and fjords, what can't we endure? Sure the enemy may tire out our armies in battle and seek to invade our lands, but Scandinavian people know that they must not give in and they must never give the enemy any advantage if possible. We fight to the very end, just as our Norse ancestors did."
 ice_althing_legislation: "Legacy of the Althing"
 ice_althing_legislation_desc: "The Althing, though somewhat outdated in these modern times, can still be useful on the local level of things. Icelandic ways of governance might be foreign to some Finnish, Sapmi, and Danish people, but we can introduce them to it over time and work on refining how the Althing functions as time goes on. It would certainly help build up a robust local governance structure that we can rely on."

 haven_for_freed_slaves_desc: "Florida has many small corridors and vacant plots of land that are rarely traversed by anyone from the government or from the military, making for a great amount of hiding places for slaves that are fleeing from their home or that have escaped captivity. We of Florida will gladly welcome these escaped people to our state and open our borders to them if they agree to some initial paperwork to formalize their entry. The more people we have, the better!"
 marshland_fighting: "Fighting in the Marshes"
 marshland_fighting_desc: "Florida's heartland is a humid places with very little in the way of mercy from the damp and hot climate. The natives here were used to the conditions and put up a fierce fight when we came to colonize the region and not long after we arrived, we learned just how crucial their fighting styles would be to our own survival. Fighting in the marshes is no easy task, but we are masters of it at this point and are able to resist massed musket fire like no other."
 deal_with_heat_and_insects: "Insects... And Heat..."
 deal_with_heat_and_insects_desc: "The insects of Florida are ruthless in the pain they cause and the diseases they spread! Whole communities can come down with debilitating diseases because of these menacing pests coupled with the heat and indeed we've lost thousands to them in the past, but it is through these painful experiences that we grow stronger. We are developing methods to stave off the threat of insects as well as to mitigate the impact that the heat and humidity has. Our civilians as well as our soldiers must adapt over time to how harsh this land is."
 formalize_hemp_sugarcane_indigo_growth: "Floridian Crops"
 formalize_hemp_sugarcane_indigo_growth_desc: "Our land is ripe for growing hemp, sugar, and indigo, but we can only utilize so much of the land for our crops before trying to go to war for more land. Perhaps we can expand our reach inland and carve out more places for plantations and farms through land development. It'll take years to do, but in time we should see a general rise in how much we produce and how well our economy can do on the world stage."
 scattered_yet_plentiful_fortifications: "Outposts and Watchtowers"
 scattered_yet_plentiful_fortifications_desc: "Castles and bastions with great walls of stone are few and far between in the Floridian heartland since the ground to build on is often wet, unstable, and prone to changes over the years. That is why we build several fortified outposts and watchtowers equipped with skilled shooters and runners for communication, and on top of all that these defensive structures are much easier to build than a normal castle. We'd do well to continue building these light defenses in the future to help slow down any advancing enemies."
 floridian_harbors: "Floridian Harbors"
 floridian_harbors_desc: "Whilst we have marshy terrain all around our heartland, we have waters of all kinds around us that are fit for trade and combat. Being that so much potential for Florida lies not just in its land and people but also out at sea, we should be keen on building up suitable harbors and docks for our fleet of ships. There is plenty of suitable coastline to start with so, we're already a step ahead of some regions nearby."
 social_mobility_for_slaves_and_natives: "Social Mobility"
 social_mobility_for_slaves_and_natives_desc: "Natives and freed slaves in our lands cannot be held back forever by our culture and government since they can provide so much in the form of taxes, production, and military manpower. If we build schools and libraries, we can also help these people rise through the society to become great Floridian administrators, but in order for any of this to happen, we need to embark on a policy of change and reform that staunchly encourages social mobility."

 organized_settlement_of_land: "Organize the Settlements"
 organized_settlement_of_land_desc: "If we can organized the land of Illinois and how the Illinoisan people settle on it, we can gain so much more in the form of tax revenue in the years to come. Along with that going for us later on, we can promote the proper development of the land via organized cutting down of various woodlands and the cultivation of specially designated crop areas."

 combat_against_natives_desc: "Though it hasn't been often that we of Illinois are needed to fight extensively, we have been called upon to defend our own settlements from various native tribes in the past and even to this day. We must be sure that we have enough troops to man the defensive structures we have and to also do battle with any enemy force that seeks to destroy what we've worked so hard to build up over the decades."
 utilize_water_ways: "The Ease of Rivers"
 utilize_water_ways_desc: "Rivers, where would be without rivers? They're a great way of transporting goods to far away places with less work (most of the time), they provide a source of water to us, and they also help indicate where other potentially friendly settlements might be. The more we can use the rivers to our advantage in terms of trade and business deals, the better off we will be as a whole."
 tenuous_borders: "Finding the Real Borders"
 tenuous_borders_desc: "Due to where we are situated, borders are less cut-and-dry compared to other places that are more heavily inhabited by dense cities and dedicated roads. As a result, we're often redefining where our borders are at the local level with various communities and towns on the border with our neighbors. When push comes to shove and war breaks out though, we can use this to our advantage and use some very favorable maps at the peace conference that allow us to take even more land."
 wealth_over_war: "Wealth Over War"
 wealth_over_war_desc: "If we can avoid war, we'd rather do so than take our chances with our economy and investments. By focusing our economy and administration more so on internal development and the securing of trade deals from various regions nearby our own, we'll be able to get a greater amount of overall wealth than we would've gotten through wars that could go any which way."
 fortification_at_our_front: "In Defense of Illinois"
 fortification_at_our_front_desc: "We will defend what is rightfully ours to the very end. The gold and silver we've brought into our treasury and the wealth we've created for our citizens, it will not be robbed by the greedy hands of war or other disasters. If we need to build up even more fortifications than what we already have in order to protect our precious cities and people, then so be it."

 urbanize_further_desc: "Our island is large enough and also flat enough to support larger cities in comparison to what other islands around the Caribbean can support. Because of this, we have gained a great number of settlers over the decades both before and after our independence. These settlers will be useful in not only expanding Cuban military measures and economic aspects, but they will also help develop new settlements all across our central island and beyond."
 centralize_governance_in_cuba: "Strong Central Governance"
 centralize_governance_in_cuba_desc: "Cuba is a place of splendor and majesty, but also a place of strong central authority and governance. Even before we gained independence, we had a strong administration that oversaw the entirety of Cuban domains so that the rise in the amount of settlers coming to our land would be organized properly. We will keep this legacy of central authority and without a doubt enforce our laws and legislation with fairness all throughout Cuba."

 defend_cuban_waters_desc: "We have seen battle after battle take place near our shores with various fleets being destroyed and whole crews of sailors going down into the murky depths below. Cuba is not safe without a navy nor a military, but if we cannot protect our coasts from imperial colonizers like our former overlord, what good are we as a nation? We will make it known that the waters around our central island are Cuban waters, defended by the grandest fleet in the entire Caribbean."
 trade_with_new_world_polities: "New World Trade Deals"
 trade_with_new_world_polities_desc: "With our independence secured and the wars for independence raging on throughout the various parts of the New World, we should take the time to start investing in these upcoming states who are fighting for their own rights and values. We are a much better trade partner for them than the colonial overlords that seek only to extract wealth from colonial entities, so we can go forth with some safety knowning that we will be seen in a more favorable light."
 learn_advanced_naval_strategy: "Uphold the Cuban Fleet"
 learn_advanced_naval_strategy_desc: "Naval strategy and the perfection of it over time is tough, but Cuba is uniquely situated to be at the forefront of this endeavor. Defending our waters and engaging in various wars that involve conflicts on the high seas will continually breed stronger and more adept admirals and sailors who know exactly what to do in the midst of a broadside battle. We have faith that our fleet can withstand whatever comes their way in the future."
 armed_at_all_times: "Never Surrender"
 armed_at_all_times_desc: "And should any enemy land on Cuban shores, they will find not a welcoming local population that takes them in without trouble. Instead, they will find a population of righteous people armed with muskets and rifles, willing to fight to keep the liberty that was gained so many years ago. There will be no mercy when an enemy steps foot into our land, just like they would have no mercy on us if Cubans were to do the same."

 a_crimson_laden_culture: "Crimson Colored Culture"
 a_crimson_laden_culture_desc: "We are very distinct from our neighbors in a number of ways, but perhaps the most blatant way we are different is through the distinctly red colored clothing we wear and our red wall paintings and murals. Few other places have the resource that can make such brilliant red dye and it is because of this rarity and how we use the red dye that others come to see us as a better diplomatic partner. Perhaps red can become the standard royalty?"
 diarchical_administration: "Diarchical Administration"
 diarchical_administration_desc: "Ichma administration is divided into two parts roughly: the 'anan (upper) saya ichma' and the 'luran (lower) saya ichma', which represent the upper communities in the highlands and the lower communities closer to the coast. Because the coastal communities are much more vital to the survival of our state, they have traditionally held more sway over government matters, but we must work to continually enforce balanced legislative rules and pass laws that benefit all communities when possible."
 adorn_the_dead: "Adorn the Dead"
 adorn_the_dead_desc: "The dead of Ichma must not be sent off with nothing but dirt and rocks at their side, no, that would be degrading their worth! They must their valuables and jewels buried with them, at least partly, so that their journey to the afterlife is not a dark and burdensome one. In this way, we honor our recently deceased men and women and bring peace to their body at least in this realm. We only hope that in the next realm, they are as well off as they were here."
 ichma_pyramids_of_devotion: "The Pyramids of the Ichma"
 ichma_pyramids_of_devotion_desc: "How can we contact the divine? How can we properly ascertain their messages and send messages back to them? It is certainly not out in the open with harsh conditions beating down at us whilst we are the midst of the gods, so the pyramids of our ancestors can do just fine. It will not be only those pyramids though, for we can build more as time goes on in other places where the Ichma people settle down into."
 unite_the_confederacies_of_old: "The Pieces of the Wari Empire"
 unite_the_confederacies_of_old_desc: "The breakup of the Wari Empire was long ago, but we remember rightly that the Ichma people came about in the ashes of the burning state. Not only us, but many others got their start when the Wari Empire began to burn, leading to several confederacies of people forming afterwards. Some may still be around and some may have been conquered, but we of Ichma must do what we can to reunite the old lands of the Wari Empire."
 huaca_of_the_ichma: "Huaca of the Ichma"
 huaca_of_the_ichma_desc: "A huaca is something of a monument, sometimes natural and sometimes man-made, that is revered by not only our people but also by other people around us. Some huaca are known to have rituals of veneration and devotion dedicated to them whilst others are along pilgrimage routes for our various gods. The more huaca we can get under our control, the more unified and satiated our people will be."
 successor_to_the_wari_people: "Succeed the Wari Empire"
 successor_to_the_wari_people_desc: "The memories of the old Wari Empire fade away as time goes on; their old cities and artificats are not going to be around forever, but what they put forth can still be a foundation to build upon. Let us renew the efforts of the Wari people of old and pick up where they left off, triumphing over disasters that come our way and military foes who seek to dismantle our power."

 tholing_tabo_and_khochar_monasteries: "Tholing, Tabo, and Khochar Monasteries"
 tholing_tabo_and_khochar_monasteries_desc: "Yeshe-Ö, the second king after our founding, was perhaps the greatest leader from our past. Through his work of leading the second revival of Buddhism in Tibetan lands, sponsoring novice monastic people to travel to different lands, and constructing some of the most revered monuments in all of Tibet, we of Guge are well known and have gained a great amount of influence. But, his work was not militarily secured and Guge remained a rather small kingdom despite his grandeur, thus leaving us with merely prestigious structures that survive to now such as the three monasteries."
 old_city_of_tsaparang: "The City of Tsaparang"
 old_city_of_tsaparang_desc: "Though it was not always our capital, Tsaparang has become a haven for the rulers of Guge. It has slowly been built up over time due partially to the fact that successful claimants in civil wars centering around Tsaparang instead of Tholing, meaning that today Tsaparang is something that inspires both faith in the ruler of Guge and trust in their governance."
 kingdom_of_tibetan_buddhism_revival: "The Revivers of Tibetan Buddhism"
 kingdom_of_tibetan_buddhism_revival_desc: "There is one key title that we of Guge hold: the revivers of Tibetan Buddhism. The form of Buddhism that took root in Tibet changed and morphed over the centuries due to various influences such as shifting borders in the Tarim Basin and ambitions to conquer land whilst also controlling politics at home in the mountainous cities of Lhasa, Dege, Shigatse, and many others. When it looked like the flame of Buddhism in our land was about to be extinguished, it was the rulers of Guge who gave renewed life to the flame, and it is this period of revival that many still know us for."
 strive_for_religious_education: "Religious Education"
 strive_for_religious_education_desc: "Though education is seen as necessary to progress in life by many, few in Guge are able to actually become literate and fully capable of being productive in life despite being fully fledged Buddhists. Let us work to change this as time goes on and promote the building of not only monasteries in our lands, but also libraries and schools that focus on Buddhist texts and also other subjects such as mathematics and geography."
 ready_to_reform_the_faith: "Another Revival?"
 ready_to_reform_the_faith_desc: "The way Buddhism currently is in Tibetan land is not going to stay the same forever since, over the coming decades, we will gain new people and followers who bring new perspectives on old texts, mantras, and traditions that we already know so well. What then do we do and say to these new insights? We welcome them, of course! We will bring them into the wider inter-faith dialogue and be ready to reform our understanding of canonical texts, but it will take time for this to happen."
 converse_with_indian_buddhists: "Conferences and Conversations"
 converse_with_indian_buddhists_desc: "We are not going to be closed off to the other branches of Buddhism that are spread throughout the various lands around Tibet. The traditions of the Indian people, the traditions of the Chinese, the traditions of the Burmese and Thai, they can all contribute to the wider dialogue and conversation we of Guge wish to have, but we simply need more people ready and willing to travel these long distances. Perhaps setting up a formal diplomatic sector is in order?"
 cultural_blending_in_guge: "All Under the Guidance of Guge"
 cultural_blending_in_guge_desc: "Guge has proven itself to be a guiding pillar of Buddhism before when all was thought to be lost in Tibetan lands; when Buddhism seemed to be fragmented to the point of no return. With the resurgance of the grand faith thanks to our hard work and reforms, we can now work on assimilating the various people who are coming into the fold of Guge so that they too can come toward the path of enlightenment. We cannot and will not deny anybody this right in Guge."

 utilize_religious_sects_desc: "There are a variety of small and large schools of Buddhism throughout Tibet and all are useful for various purposes, but when push comes to shove in politics, we will pull all the strings we can to enlist the help of these various Buddhist schools. We are not averse to fighting like some smaller polities are, for we have been in the midst of fighting for decades now! Fighting to secure our place in Tibet and fighting to have our words become law!"
 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch: "Uphold the Karma Kagyu School"
 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch_desc: "We are not patrons of the Gelug school of Vajrayana Buddhism which some find strange. Instead, we support the Karma Kagyu school which is quite different in a number of ways when compared to the Gelug school. Its traditional hierarchs, the Karmapa and Shamarpa, should be great friends of our dynasty instead of having to quarrel with other religious schools; they will know our good will and will be one of the strategic pillars of our rise to power."
 sort_through_muddy_marriages: "Profit from Bad Marriages"
 sort_through_muddy_marriages_desc: "Marriages can be a... Tough negotiation for some, to put it nicely, and this is very widely pronounced in the royal families of Tibet since a failing marriage or two in a royal family can lead to widespread discontent in places far away from the royal palace. We were ones to capitalize on marriage conflicts in the previous royal family of Tibet, the Phagmodrupa, and we will continue to profit from future bad marriages around us whilst make sure our own marriages are safe and without issue."
 at_the_heart_of_turmoil: "Heart of Tibetan Turmoil"
 at_the_heart_of_turmoil_desc: "There is no shortage of warfare in the heartlands of Tibet. Local lords wanting autonomy, Nepali states struggling against Hindu and Islamic states to the south, Muslim khans to the north threatening our survival, nothing is ever easy up here! If continued war is required to survive in our own land than we will take up arms without hesitation!"
 keep_the_sects_loyal: "Keeping the Sects Loyal"
 keep_the_sects_loyal_desc: "The Rinpungpa dynasty must not lose the favor of the Karma Kagyu school of Buddhism nor the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism that have sent aid in the past. We should be enforcing more secular authority over these sects when possible, or if this is not possible, then at least be informed about the moves these sects are making so that we can effectively counter them politically or religiously when the time comes."
 put_pretenders_to_rest: "Confront Pretenders"
 put_pretenders_to_rest_desc: "Some still see us as pretenders to the throne and think that the Phagmodrupa dynasty should be empowered once again, but we simply cannot let this happen. The Rinpungpa dynasty is in a much better place than the Phagmodrupa dynasty ever was, and if there are any pretenders who wish to install this old dynasty back on the throne, we will gladly meet them in battle or silence them before they can even raise a war banner."
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans: "Refuse Local Lords"
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans_desc: "The loyalty of local lords is always questionable in Tibet, is it not? Few if any can be truly honest if they are selected by members outside of our administration, meaning we are going to need to overhaul the way we govern as time goes on to better enforce laws that come directly from the Rinpungpa dynasty. Autonomous lords and authorities that answered to previous people we conquered will be granted no quarter; they will be replaced."

 gongchen_monastery_desc: "Founded by the Thangtong Gyalpo, also known as the Iron Bridge Maker, the Gonchen Monastery is perhaps one of the most revered places in all of Kham next to the royal palace itself. The monastery has stripes of white, dark red, and gray colors that are unique to the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, and itt is through this monastery that we will project our legitimacy and devotion to all the people of Kham."
 monastery_and_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Material Works of the Iron Bridge Maker"
 monastery_and_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The great Thangtong Gyalpo graced many with his presence and works, including us who administrate Kham. He built our revered Gonchen Monastery and also was an adept architect, blacksmith, and civil engineer, making his impact known in the various lands of Tibet and Bhutan. Not only this, but he also considered the patron saint of theatre in our lands and he is known as 'the madman of the empty land'. Truly his impact on our land and history is unparalleled."
 spiritual_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Spiritual Works of the Iron Bridge Maker"
 spiritual_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The works of Thangtong Gyalpo were not only in the physical realm though! His work extended far into the realm of Tibetan Buddhism since he is associated with the Shangpa Kagyu, Nyingma, and Sakya schools. Not only this, but he also recognized the first Samding Dorja Phagmo, the highest female incarnation in Tibet and the third highest-ranking persion in the hierarchy after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. On top of all of this, he founded the Iron Chain leneage of the Shangpa Kagyu school, thus furthering his work and influence. Truly, Thangtong is a reincarnation of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen."
 uphold_dege: "Upholding Dege"
 uphold_dege_desc: "Dege, as our capital city, should be upheld in the highest regard next to the various monasteries and sacred sites we possess. It should be built up to not only project our prominence, but also to attract foreign scholars and religious folk who also wish to come toward the path of Buddhism. As Kham continues to grow outward, so too will our capital city."
 uphold_tibetan_literature: "Tibetan Literature"
 uphold_tibetan_literature_desc: "Literature in Tibetan lands can be somewhat scarce and lacking due to a variety of reasons, but as time goes on, the potential for this to change is becoming more and more abundant to us. By putting through reforms to start paper production and to educate the minds of younger and younger people, we can begin to cultivate a strong literary culture throughout Kham."
 formalize_derge_districts: "Formalize the Districts"
 formalize_derge_districts_desc: "City organization in Tibet hasn't been the highest priority to many leaders both local and royal, but routinely we are seeing the need to plan our cities out more and more as time goes on. Starting with Dege, we should work to plan out our new districts in various cities with engineers and workers alike so that buildings are as functional as possible and also robust in their construction."
 chinese_contacts: "Chinese Contacts"
 chinese_contacts_desc: "To our east is the Sichuan Basin, a great trading hub for Tibetans and Chinese people alike. Chengdu may be ethnically Chinese, but we are thankful that it has blossomed into a grand city of trade and production since the path from Chengdu to Dege is fairly clear to many. Contacts with our eastern neighbors will only continue to serve us well later on as trade grows ever more plentiful."

 after_the_yuan_dynasty_desc: "After the decline of the Yuan Dynasty to our east, the authority in Tibet that the Mongols once had waned heavily and we were one of the bastions of Tibetan strength. Our dynasty created an autonomous Tibetan state and formally threw off the shackles of Mongol authority and it is because of this that many still flock to our banners."
 regents_for_the_old_kings: "Regents to the Old Kings"
 regents_for_the_old_kings_desc: "Our early rulers did not strive for earthly titles that gave meaningless honor, for they knew that they were regents for the old kings of Tibet. The glory of those olden days may not be coming back any time soon, but we can still strive to be humble like our first set of rulers and live as they did, for the Tibetan people and by Tibetan laws."
 fortified_city_governance: "Dzong Governance"
 fortified_city_governance_desc: "To help organize our political situation, forming a solid basis for authority beneath us was crucial in our upbringing. The creation of dzongs (fortified cities meant for local governance) helped cement our authority on the local level and did a great amount of work in projecting our power throughout Tibet when we were much larger in size."
 tibetan_laws_for_our_land: "Staunchly Tibetan Laws"
 tibetan_laws_for_our_land_desc: "No longer are we ruled by Mongolian laws, but rather by Tibetan laws! Those foreign edicts and measures put on our people in the past were undoubtedly burdensome, but now since we've been independent, we have been able to implement laws meant for our own people. No longer will we bear the weight of the old Mongol authorities."
 neutral_relations_on_the_outside: "Neutral Relations are Good Relations"
 neutral_relations_on_the_outside_desc: "When the Ming Dynasty rose up in the place of the Yuan Dynasty, it was clear that they did not think much of us in Tibet. These fairly neutral relations were and still are beneficial to us, since we can thrive whilst being left alone and not pressured diplomatically from various sides."
 three_functional_parts_of_the_dynasty: "Three Parts to the Dynasty"
 three_functional_parts_of_the_dynasty_desc: "The Phagmodrupa dynasty is divided up into three parts: the ruling 'desi', the spiritual masters (chen-nga), and the preserver of the family (dunggyu dsinpa). This helps ensure not only the piety of our lineage, but also the continuation of far into the future... But, it can also lead to a number of internal feuds if we are not careful."
 the_fire_of_feuds: "Fires in our Family"
 the_fire_of_feuds_desc: "Failed marriages and corruption are not strangers to the Phagmodrupa dynasty, not since the Rinpungpa dynasty has risen up and taken advantage of our vulnerable position in the past. We need to learn how to sort out our internal conflicts in the future so that we can prevent future disturbances and revolts, and most of all, we will exact revenge upon the Rinpungpa dynasty."

 memories_of_wari_influence_desc: "The old Wari Empire of centuries ago is no longer around, but the pieces that lay around the land, scattered and independent, remember vaguely what the Wari people built up and cultivated. Some of these old road networks and paths we can still use, and Cajamarca's foundation will be built off of moving quickly thanks to these old paths between villages and towns."
 beacon_of_culture: "Beacon of Culture"
 beacon_of_culture_desc: "Cajamarca is perhaps the most complex and grand political state that emerged after the collapse of the Wari Empire. Though we are not on the level of the Wari Empire in terms of size or strength, we still have some of the finest pottery and works of art in all of the mountainous land. Surely over time we will attract the likes of various scholars and religious people alike who will serve in Cajamarca."
 experiences_from_civil_wars: "Civil Wars are Experience"
 experiences_from_civil_wars_desc: "In our past, civil conflict was something that we could not avoid. Even today, civil war looms on the horizon and threatens our people with devasation if politics in Cajamarca decline horribly. But, there is one thing that these wretched conflicts breed in our soldiers: experience. How to prepare for battle and get supply lines ready, these are things they'll never forget thanks to our previous eras of internal strife."
 from_oral_tradition_to_written: "Begin Writing"
 from_oral_tradition_to_written_desc: "Oral tradition is a great thing for Cajamarca and indeed many of the surrounding people groups we interact with, but oral history is something we cannot rely on forever. We should begin a new effort to formally begin making a writing system for our people so that the oral history of our ancestors may never be truly lost, even when our current elders pass away."
 start_roads_of_cajamarca: "Start Building Roads"
 start_roads_of_cajamarca_desc: "Old Wari paths are just the perfect places for future road networks. The innovations in road making done by those in Cusco are spreading quickly and we of Cajamarca would be wise to adopt them, utilizing their fine designs for ourselves and having our military officers trained in exactly how the should operate."
 fighting_the_quito: "Quito Conflicts"
 fighting_the_quito_desc: "The northern area where the Quito people live is a place of consistent conflict. Though some chiefs and rulers have made peace with us before, more often than not our interests are in conflict with each other. In order to fully subjugate the Quito people and perhaps any others who would wish to go against our interests, we will need a larger standing military."
 the_cuismancu_state: "A True Cajamarca State"
 the_cuismancu_state_desc: "The consistent fighting and bloodshed in the mountains is only hardening Cajamarca and its people from all walks of life. We are learning how to govern more effectively, utilize diplomacy to our advantage, and also how to enforce higher military standards as time goes on. We will not rest until the threats to the Cajamarca state are subjugatd or destroyed in their entirety."

 uyghur_gansu_kingdom_memories_desc: "Do we remember our olden times of the Gansu Kingdom? It is a faded memory, but one that is distinct and unique to us as Yellow Uyghurs or, Yugurs as sometimes we are called. This period was prosperous for us indeed, but also a time of intense warfare between us and various other people since we occupied a very valuable position. It is this tradition of warfare that we still remember to this day."
 our_trade_is_warfare: "A Life of War"
 our_trade_is_warfare_desc: "Even when we held the position as a mighty kingdom, war was still part of our life, year by year and decade by decade. After our destruction and period of subjugation by the Tanguts and later by the Western Xia and then the Mongols, we remember just how integral war has been for us. Conquest is the only path for us in the future, and there will be no satiating this ambition within the Yugur people."
 the_influences_of_buddhism: "Influences of Buddhism"
 the_influences_of_buddhism_desc: "Buddhism has come into the lands of the Uyghurs due to being so close to Tibet and the Chinese people, though the latter practice Confucianism along with Buddhism. We are not opposed to Buddhism and its influences since its teaching can often go hand-in-hand with the traditions of Tengri. Perhaps in time we can even learn to become somewhat tolerant of foreign faiths that don't line up with with the traditions of Tengri, but that is for later."
 learn_from_tangut_dominance: "Tales of the Tangut Period"
 learn_from_tangut_dominance_desc: "The destruction of our old kingdom led into a period where we were dominated by the Tanguts. It was a dark time where we were forced from a place of grace into a place of relative uncertainty and subjugation. It is something we will never forget and something we will fight to never let happen to us again."
 the_western_xia_war: "The Western Xia War"
 the_western_xia_war_desc: "In the times of our old kingdom, the Western Xia made war against us and inflicted costly casualties to our people and helped weaken us for more foreign foes later on. Learning from this costly war has led to our best commanders and officers thinking that we should be investing in a larger and more structure military instead of trying to focus on pure diplomacy to prevent such a destructive war in the future."
 reconnect_with_our_kin: "Reconnect with Uyghurs Elsewhere
 reconnect_with_our_kin_desc: "The Uyghurs are scattered and disunited, following various banners and foreign laws that are meant to subjugate and take advantage of the good potential in the Uyghur people.

 ming_connections_desc: "The Ming Dynasty is not exactly friendly to the people of the steppe, but we are something of an exception. We have proven useful to some on the border of the Ming Dynasty and as such we have gained firm diplomatic connections with influential figures. If we can utilize them effectively and promote ourselves even further, we will be able to garner alliances and relations much more easily."

 the_carnage_of_oirat_ming_wars_desc: "Between the fighting that goes on between the Oirat Horde and the Ming Dynasty, we are stuck almost in the middle of it all wondering who will come out on top. If we are ambitious enough, we can capitalize on the destruction of the losing side and make valuable gains for all of Kara Del, but we will have to be strategic about when and where we strike. The traditions of our ancestors in the steppe necessitate that conquest be key to our survival, and this is the perfect playground for us to do as such."
 descendants_of_the_chagatai: "Descendants of the Chagatai Khanate"
 descendants_of_the_chagatai_desc: "Our origins lie in the thoughts and actions of a Chagatai prince in the past and to some, it is a menial origin story that has little meaning. To us though, it grants us valuable connections dynastically to the Chagatai Khanate that came after the split of the old Mongol Empire. Maintaining our dyanstic presence will ensure loyalty and legitimacy in the people we will over."
 playing_the_role_of_subject: "The Benefits of Subjugation"
 playing_the_role_of_subject_desc: "We have been subjects of larger powers in the past since Kara Del has historically been a weak power. This has its consequences of paying tribute and such, but we have benefited via taking into account the better technology and organization that our overlords had. Taking advantage of the advances our neighbors have and implementing reforms in their style, well, why wouldn't we continue to do it?" 
 to_what_deity_do_we_praise: "Islam? Buddhism? Tengri?"
 to_what_deity_do_we_praise_desc: "We find ourselves at the confluence of several faiths: Tengri and its traditions, Islam and its five pillars, and Buddhism and its schools of thought. It is not easy choosing one religion over the other as Kara Del has populations of all three in its land, but we can at least try to make do in tolerating all three whenever possible. Promoting a stance of tolerance will undoubtedly lend to a greater amount of people flocking to our stable banner."
 mercenaries_from_the_oirat: "Contracts in the Steppe"
 mercenaries_from_the_oirat_desc: "Our connections to the Chagatai Khanate lends us connections all around the steppe which is good since there are a variety of mercenary forces that will be more in favor of working for an influential descendant of the Chagatai. Hiring these largely cavalry-based armies will cost us, but we know that they will be worth it later on since they can act as a good buffer for our own forces."
 emphasis_on_cavalry: "Embrace our Heritage"
 emphasis_on_cavalry_desc: "Though our connections with the Ming Dynasty are somewhat firm, we cannot discard our traditions nor our connections to the steppe. Cavalry armies are something that we know inside and out, and focusing on reforming how they work in battle is going to be one of our main focuses in the future. The more than can flank and support our main cadre of soldiers, the better."

 the_cacan_language: "The Cacan Language"
 the_cacan_language_desc: "Our language is not as formalized as other languages nearby but it is prominent in the lands of the Calchaqui people; it is our distinguishing feature that helps identify us uniquely in the crowd of states in the Andes Mountains. The more we formalize it though, the more useful it will become and the more standardized it can be from place to place in our own lands, thus granting easier communication to all people in our domain."
 northern_influences_in_calchaqui: "Influences from the North"
 northern_influences_in_calchaqui_desc: "To our north are other states that quarrel in the mountains due to various feuds and conflicts, but we do not seek to get involved with those petty situations. We are seeing more and more people come south due to those struggles, however, and as a result we are becoming slowly influences by our northern neighbors. Perhaps we can utilize this influence in a positive way? Preparing ourselves for any incoming war that might come to us due to border tensions and such."

 mutual_friendship_between_cacan_groups_desc: "There are some groups of Cacan speaking people that don't really know who to pledge fealty to or to what state they should go to. Though we speak the same language, they don't feel as closely connected to us unfortunately due to the years we have spent trying to consolidate our own power and maintain stability. If we can reach out to these groups and befriend them over time, we can slowly integrate them into the Calchaqui confederation as it stands."
 reprisals_against_invaders: "Reprisals Against Invaders"
 reprisals_against_invaders_desc: "As we slowly unite the various Cacan speaking groups of people around us, we must instill in them a staunch defensive mentality against those who would invade our lands. There are some who think the lands of the Calchaqui can be just pillaged and settled by other populations, but we will bring to them a stalwart defense that will grind down their will to fight. The Cacan speaking people will not be taken out so easily."
 cultivate_a_proper_confederation: "A True Confederation"
 cultivate_a_proper_confederation_desc: "Centralizing authority in our lands is something we struggle with since people are so spread out and our work at formalizing our language is still going on, but making loyal that contribute to the Calchaqui cause nicely is much easier to do. Perhaps a federated state is not our true path, but instead a more confederated state is what will make us truly great."
 construct_calchaqui_fortifications: "Strong Stone Fortifications"
 construct_calchaqui_fortifications_desc: "To help with our defensive stance, we shall erect strong stone fortifications with multiple layers inside that can withstand enemy assaults and siege tactics. We are not going to simply put up stone slabs we find out in nature though, we are going to cut them and shape them into effective shapes and work toward making them an effective barrier that can hold back the advances of our enemy."
 until_there_is_nothing_left: "To the Bitter End"
 until_there_is_nothing_left_desc: "There will be no shortage of fighting the future as people will always seek to take advante of the Calchaqui state and its weak points, but we are prepared to hold the line and fight for our very existence if things come down to it. Our peasants will take up arms, our nobles will direct militia groups, and our leaders will draw their weapons and put it all on the line in a united effort to bring back peace to Calchaqui land."
 QTO_ideas: "Quito Ideas"
 QTO_ideas_start: "Quito Traditions"
 QTO_ideas_bonus: "Quito Ambition"
 uphold_the_shyris: "The Shyris of Quito"
 uphold_the_shyris_desc: "Our great leader, the 'Shyris', is just one factor amongst others that separates us from the states to our south. The shyris is who will lead us to victory in the great struggles we will engage in, and with each one that passes from this life into the next, an elaborate and grand burial ceremony will be held for them. To those who openly oppose the shyris, they will know only death and hardship at our hands."
 on_the_edge_of_andes_power: "The Edge of the Andes"
 on_the_edge_of_andes_power_desc: "Being at the northern edge of the Andes Mountains provides the people of Quito a unique opportunity since we can interact with a host of different tribes and groups of people who do not form cohesive states like our own. Their culture and tradtiions might very well be alien to us, but we are not beyond learning to accept them into our fold; our shyris and those around him know the value of accepting these people as they are."
 quitu_cara_cultural_power: "Quitu-Cara Culture"
 quitu_cara_cultural_power_desc: "Quito is not a political entity with a single 'Quito' culture that extends back for many centuries. Instead, the original Quitu people were conquered some centuries ago by people of the Cara culture, but the conquest did not bring about great death and destruction as one might think. Instead, it brought about a combining of cultures into a product that is greater than its previous individual parts. This Quitu-Cara culture that sprang forth is what we are today and it is what we draw power from in our administration and in our military."
 quito_tombs: "Quito Tombs"
 quito_tombs_desc: "To help decorate those who pass from this life into the next, tombs of lavish design and detail will be made out of both wood and stone alike. Honoring the dead is perhaps one of the most crucial parts of the traditions passed down to us and it is with great pride and care that we do so."
 trade_with_various_tribes: "Tribal Exchanges and Trade"
 trade_with_various_tribes_desc: "Just as we meet and try to integrate the tribes around us, we should be keen on trading with them as well. They hold connections to places far beyond our current reach, meaning we could greatly benefit from promoting trade with them over time. Even when we integrate them inside of our borders, maintaining healthy relationships with the tribal people will be key to keeping the economy of Quito running smoothly."
 integrate_the_others_into_quito: "Integrate Other Cultures"
 integrate_the_others_into_quito_desc: "Over time, we are learning to accept and work with people who speak different languages and perform different rituals. Some words blend together over the decades and centuries, some rituals become closer together in how they are performed, and eventually the bond of common kinship is formed as these people join hands with our own. It is these joined hands and through bonds of kinship built up over many ages that Quito will maintain its power both politically and militarily."
 celebrate_our_lives: "Celebrate Life"
 celebrate_our_lives_desc: "Though we may give our people a grand way of being sent off into the next life, we must also take time to celebrate our own life as it is, right? Feasts filled with joy and praise to the gods above, games being played by children and adults, instruments being played by our own family members, and good times being had by all within our communities. These are the times we should relish and adore, not just the times of victory via conquest or the success of a good harvest."
 ZAF_ideas: "Massina Ideas"
 ZAF_ideas_start: "Massina Traditions"
 ZAF_ideas_bonus: "Massina Ambition"
 part_of_the_muslim_uprisings: "The Fulani Jihad!"
 part_of_the_muslim_uprisings_desc: "For far too long there have been kafirs and infidels taking power against Islamic emirs and sheiks, but no more! Massina will be one of the many spearheads of the jihad started by Fulani people and there will be Islamic justice for all those who used their power to stifle Islam's spread! To arms, brothers and sisters, to arms!"
 madrasas_of_massina: "Islamic Learning of Massina"
 madrasas_of_massina_desc: "Though Massina is new to the land it sits upon, Islam is not new and as such certain ideas about Islam are already spread heavily in certain cities of ours. Let us help promote Islam's spread by building up madrasas throughout the land so that not only can ideas be propagated over time, but also things such as literacy and mathematics can be utilized by a wider portion of the populace."
 strict_islamic_interpretation: "The Strictness of Islam"
 strict_islamic_interpretation_desc: "There can be no room for a loose interpretation of Islam in Massina; there must be exact wording in our laws and strict adherence to what is outlined throughout the Quran and the Hadiths. Through our interpretation of Islam we will have a tighter grip on power and few will be able to question our authority without also raising questions about their own piety."
 regulated_use_niger_river_land: "Regulate Land Usage"
 regulated_use_niger_river_land_desc: "As part of our laws we firmly regulate the usage of land along the Niger River. This has resulted in a great rise in productive potential since people can use the land in a proper and organized manner instead of roaming about without clear boundaries. In time, we will see our profits increase when trade along the Niger River comes through to Massina."
 the_guards_of_hamdullahi: "The Guards of Hamdullahi"
 the_guards_of_hamdullahi_desc: "Hamdullahi is a significant city in Massina as it holds a great deal of cultural history to us. The guards of Hamdullahi, though undoubtedly changed at this point since their inception, still stand as a monument to our past and should be remembered for their stalwart attitude in defending Hamdullahi against invading forces. If we can instill this defensive mentality in more people, our defensive capabilities will be much better."
 strengthen_laws_of_land_development: "Strengthen Land Development"
 strengthen_laws_of_land_development_desc: "Through our laws on land development, more and more people are coming to our cities and communities to settle down and begin a new life of agriculture instead of living a pastoral and nomadic life. This has granted us advantages over time and allowed us to start developing our urban centers even further than before which we will certainly need to do as times continue to change around Massina."
 open_up_to_islamic_dialogue: "The Seeds of Religious Dialogue"
 open_up_to_islamic_dialogue_desc: "And as our urban centers grow, we will be attracting new religious scholars and preachers who interpret Islamic doctrine differently than we do. Instead of turning them away and persecuting all those who think differently from us, we can perhaps have some religious dialogue over time and open up specific centers of religious study so that we can refine our own interpretation of Islam alongside others."
 SOF_ideas: "Bamana Ideas"
 SOF_ideas_start: "Bamana Traditions"
 SOF_ideas_bonus: "Bamana Ambition"
 patrol_the_niger_river: "Patrol the Niger River"
 patrol_the_niger_river_desc: "The blood of an empire can be trade revenue, and for the Bamana state, trade along the Niger River is proving to be almost like blood for us. We must always be striving to make sure it is safe and secure so that not only can we profit from trade canoes going along its flowing streams, but so that we can profit from producing valuable crops alongside the banks of the river itself."
 subjugate_rival_chiefs: "Subjugate Internal Pretenders"
 subjugate_rival_chiefs_desc: "The pretenders to our throne and the ones who would see our power broken up are always on the lookout for weak spots in our state. We must have an active and capable military force that is ready to cut down insurgents whenever and wherever they rise up and, if it is even possible, before they rise up."
 the_komo_council: "The Komo Council"
 the_komo_council_desc: "The administration of Bamana is traditional in many ways. Our ancestors are revered all across our land throughout our court system and the komo, a body of advisors dedicated solely to theological matters, helps us conduct our worship to our ancestors correctly. Let us hope and pray for a better future that all of Bamana can partake in."
 the_slave_war_cycle: "The Slave-War Cycle"
 the_slave_war_cycle_desc: "Slaves and wars are consistent throughout West Africa and we are no different in relying on the continual slave-war cycle. Part of our economy and military rely on the capturing and trading around of slaves so it is only right that we become adept at manipulating this cycle to our advantage. The more calculated our war efforts are and if we can deal with slaves on a consistent basis, we'll see the populace become used to this cycle as well as the state itself."
 build_up_segu_cities: "Build up Bamana Cities"
 build_up_segu_cities_desc: "Our cities grow more and more as we continue to move on in the world, but how should we go about improving them over time? City planning is, after all, a key feature of a well-defined state and we of course are striving to be just that. Perhaps investing in Bamana architecture and engineering and promoting slave work for these endeavors would help bring a semblance of city planning to our land."
 sculptures_and_altars_to_our_ancestors: "To Our Ancestors"
 sculptures_and_altars_to_our_ancestors_desc: "The sculptures and altars we fashion for our long gone ancestors are finely made and well thought out. They have meaning in almost every detail and our administration rightly places a great emphasis on them being part of the centrality of our state since they represent such significant figures of our past. Promoting the fine crafting of these works of art and faithfulness should be something we always strive to do."
 improve_upon_songhai_build_methods: "Improve Building Methods"
 improve_upon_songhai_build_methods_desc: "The methods of building we obtained from the Songhai are more for building defensive structures and they have served us well so far. Continuing to develop these methods of constructing walls, garrisons, and defensive structures from the materials we have around us will help improve our defensive positions and provide more security to our people."
 YAO_ideas: "Yao Ideas"
 YAO_ideas_start: "Yao Traditions"
 YAO_ideas_bonus: "Yao Ambition"
 fusion_of_kayi_and_ngizimis_clan: "Fusion of Two Clans"
 fusion_of_kayi_and_ngizimis_clan_desc: "The inception of Yao came as a result of our nomadic ancestors coming into prolonged contact with Kanem Bornu's people. After this, a slow fusion of two clans happened, this being between the Kayi Clan and Ngizimis Kanembu Clan, and the result was the political entity of Yao. Tracing our heritage back to this pivotal period is what our people look up to time and time again, and we will always trace our lineage to back to that period."
 rivalry_versus_kanem: "The Lake Chad Rivalry"
 rivalry_versus_kanem_desc: "Lake Chad is fertile ground for food and growing states, but it is also fertile ground for conflict between Kanem Bornu and ourselves, the Sultanate of Yao. We've had ages of conflict before and we will continue to in the future if we neither of us win this prolonged state of hostility that has lasted for generations."
 facing_deathly_counter_attacks: "Facing Death Again"
 facing_deathly_counter_attacks_desc: "Though we once had the upper hand against Kanem Bornu in the late 1300s, those 5 leaders we killed in Kanem Bornu did not break down the power of our enemy completely. They came back and struck a blow against us so hard it almost made the entirety of Yao collapse in on itself, but we managed to hold ourselves firm despite this devasation. That moment in time taught our people that facing death in a war is something that will be frequent for Yao, and we will still fight with all we got no matter how close to death we are."
 caravans_toward_egypt: "Caravans Toward Egypt"
 caravans_toward_egypt_desc: "Because of our position in the eastern part of Lake Chat and toward the treacherous desert, and also because of our nomadic heritage from before we settled down, we have trade contacts throughout the eastern land and even toward the Nile River. The more trade we promote eastward toward the Nile River and ultimately toward Egypt, the better off we will be in terms of revenue."
 lake_chads_importance: "The Centrality of the Lake"
 lake_chads_importance_desc: "The lake by which we base our power around is significant to many people. The fertility it provides for crops and the fact that it is also a freshwater lake means that it can support a great amount of people and a great state surrounding it. The more finely we cultivate the land here, the more we will have in store for later on."
 nomadic_warfare_ways: "The Ways of the Nomads"
 nomadic_warfare_ways_desc: "Fighting as nomadic people is something few can master, especially when the fighting is along sand dunes and sparse savannah. Though we aren't nomads anymore, the leaders of Yao are versed in nomadic warfare and moving quickly around the field of war so that the enemy has little chance of catching a friendly army out in the open."
 season_of_bilala_conquest: "Season of Conquest"
 season_of_bilala_conquest_desc: "Once our conquest of around the lake is complete and the old traditions of the Kanem Bornu state are incorporated into the Sultanate of Yao, we will begin carving a new path for ourselves and the people around Lake Chad; we will be feared by others, instead of being subjugated by rival empires and kingdoms. There is no time to rest now, not when its the season of conquest for the Bilala people!"
 KOK_ideas: "Kokand Ideas"
 KOK_ideas_start: "Kokand Traditions"
 KOK_ideas_bonus: "Kokand Ambition"
 citadel_of_kokand: "The Citadel of Kokand"
 citadel_of_kokand_desc: "Kokand itself has been our starting point and the place from which we project power from. Though it was not so grand at its start, we have worked hard to build up its defensive structures so that raids and attacks against us would yield little results. Even though we rely heavily on old khanate traditions, there is some wisdom in keeping certain positions locked down and heavily fortified."
 tajik_mercenary_fighters: "Tajik Mercenaries"
 tajik_mercenary_fighters_desc: "Mercenaries around us are plentiful and always willing to fight if we have the money to spend, and in particular the Tajik people are usually offering Uzbek states and khanates lower prices than other states due to our familial connections. Taking advantage of these blood ties can be advantageous for us when we are in a tight spot and in the future we can expand the connections we have to other mercenary groups around the steppe."
 swift_conquest_around_the_oxus: "In and Around the Oxus River"
 swift_conquest_around_the_oxus_desc: "The Oxus River has been stage for a number of states that came before us and it has seen countless conquests from a variety of people. We are going to continue this tradition and conquer land just like our ancestors have, leaving fire and blood behind us as our people march forth, banner in one hand and musket in the other."
 the_khojas_of_kashgar: "The Kashgar Khojas"
 the_khojas_of_kashgar_desc: "Khojas (meaning 'master' in Persian) are people who are descedants of the Naqshabandi Sufi teacher named Amad Kasani (1461-1542). At various points they have seen rises in power throughout Central Asia since they have been favored local and regional administrators. Perhaps we could use their service too and appoint various khojas to positions of authority in Kokand... After ensuring that they are loyal to us, of course."
 preventing_civil_wars: "Prevent Collapses"
 preventing_civil_wars_desc: "Like most other khanates we too are prone to collapse from internal strife and succession crises. Reforming laws of succession are tough as it is, but Kokand is in need of strong central authority that has an administrative body built around it, not just a lone holder of power that rules through blood and iron. If Kokand is to survive into the future, there will need to be hefty changes to our old traditions."
 unify_the_uzbek_people: "Uzbek Unity"
 unify_the_uzbek_people_desc: "Our kin that lie around the Aral Sea and west of the Tarim Basin, the Uzbek people, are rather disunited and longing for leadership that can tame their various clans. Whilst Kokand is by no means the first contender in this matter, it can strive to be the final unifying state that comes out on top and unites all of the Uzbek people into a solidified state. Doing so would bring not only unparalleled prosperity, but also a great sense of joy to the various Uzbek people."
 a_settled_khanate: "Changing Times, Changing People"
 a_settled_khanate_desc: "We cannot deny that our traditions of khans and steppe riders are becoming outdated more and more. To our south in the lands of Persia, we see sprawling cities such as Herat and Samarkand that thrive off trade and production from hard working and settled citizens; to our north and east, the endless steppe yields the same things century after century with very little change. Perhaps it is time we strike the earth and plant our banner in it once and for all, settling our people down slowly and founding new cities for the entirety of Kokand."
 colla_kingdoms_ideas: "Aymara Kingdom Ideas"
 colla_kingdoms_ideas_start: "Aymara Kingdom Traditions"
 colla_kingdoms_ideas_desc: "Aymara Kingdom Ambition"
 dualistic_governing_body: "Dualistic Governing Body"
 dualistic_governing_body_desc: "Much like other polities in the mountains we come from, our governing body is dualistic in its nature with both parts working together to govern the land in harmony but also recognizing that one side is superior to the other. Over time, we can reform this tradition into a more centralized version that still keeps true to what our ancestors set up in past ages."
 sacred_shrine_of_lake_titikaka: "Lake Titikaka Shrine"
 sacred_shrine_of_lake_titikaka_desc: "The shrine at Lake Titikaka is inhabited by our people and is held sacred by many people groups throughout the mountains and hills around us. Keeping its sanctity and keeping the land around the lake safe will help bring more faithful followers to our state."
 the_three_colla_people_groups: "Colla, Puquina, and Uro"
 the_three_colla_people_groups_desc: "The three main groups of people that make up the various cities and dominions of the Aymara people are the Colla, the Puquina, and the Uro. All three hold various amounts of power depending on what city you travel to and gaining the loyalty of all three is a must if we are to have a decent sized fighting force."
 contesting_the_mountain_territories: "Contest for the Mountains"
 contesting_the_mountain_territories_desc: "The mountains breed warfare unlike any other place around us since, even though the terrain might be rough and air might be thin, the will of the lords and kings to fight for power never ceases despite what happens. As we go forth, our people will become addept in mountain tactics and movements in and around hills to the point that we will be able to outdo any enemy that stands in our way."
 bring_up_urcosuyu_and_umasuyu: "Urcosuyu and Umasuyu"
 bring_up_urcosuyu_and_umasuyu_desc: "The two regions of Urcosuyu and Umasuyu are more so administrative divisions for us and are the basis by which we are reforming our laws of the land. By establishing these regions more firmly with inheritance laws and stronger local authorities, we will be able to develop the lands more more easily."
 earth_work_defenses: "Earthen Defenses"
 earth_work_defenses_desc: "Much like other people groups around us, the defenses of our land are made of earthen materials like stone and mud bricks. We can improve on this though, and work on how our fortifications are built from the ground up and in what ways they supported via supply routes and internal garrison structures."
 successor_to_tiwanaku: "Succeed Tiwanaku"
 successor_to_tiwanaku_desc: "The old polity of Tiwanaku that came before us, its memory has faded a great deal by now. Still, some traditions and tales live on from those olden times when Tiwanaku was around and in large part we are the only embodiment of a successor to Tiwanaku. If it falls to only us being around to succeed where they left off, then let us do so."
 NUP_ideas: "Nupe Ideas"
 NUP_ideas_start: "Nupe Traditions"
 NUP_ideas_bonus: "Nupe Ambition"
 times_of_rare_unification: "Rarely Unified"
 times_of_rare_unification_desc: "It seems like we are scattered and disunited throughout the ages and surrounding people groups take advantage of us whenever they can, but is there any hope of claiming unity amongst the Nupe people? Glimmers of light have shown this in the past, but still we remember the fighting and feuds that always brought down these hopes. Let us never forget the times of warfare before we were unified into our current state."
 etsu_nupe: "Etsu Nupe"
 etsu_nupe_desc: "The Etsu Nupe, or, King of the Nupe, is a title that has been claimed before and is claimed now, sure, but there must be solid backing behind it. We are consistently working on building up our base of power in terms of military potential, but at the same time we are working to solve age-old disputes our leader and his lineage may have with other Nupe clans and tribes."
 traditional_customs_with_islam: "To Share in Faith"
 traditional_customs_with_islam_desc: "We share many religious customs with several people groups around us, but this new faith called 'Islam' is increasingly coming forth to Nupe communities and their preachers seem intent on converting us. Whilst we will resist full conversion of this suspicious new religion, some of our friends and allies have taken up Islam and been completely fine with it; perhaps we could see what this faith has to offer us."
 the_nupe_hero_tsoede: "The Legacy of Tsoede"
 the_nupe_hero_tsoede_desc: "If there is one figure in Nupe history that we look up to, it is Tsoede, the great unifier of Nupe people. Him and his men unified the 12 villages (Tafie, Bida, Doko, Esa, Nupeko, Eda, Towagi, Egbe, Ewu, Yesa, Gaba, and Panjuru) into a single loose political entity and helped assimilate people who crossed over into Nupe territory. We will learn from his example and keep his memory alive through stories and art as we go forth into the future."
 assimilate_the_border_people: "Taking in the Border People"
 assimilate_the_border_people_desc: "There are a variety of people on our border as the border itself is not concrete; it is porous and can be freely passed through at times by a variety of people. Thus, we find a great number of settlements at our borders and these people do not speak our language or share many Nupe cultural traits. Perhaps bringing our traditions and culture to them will help cement their fealty and loyalty to us and bring them closer to being true Nupe people."
 power_through_marriages_and_kinship: "The Power of Kin"
 power_through_marriages_and_kinship_desc: "Bringing together two different sides through the act of marriage is at times a great way to ease tensions and we of Nupe are keen on making sure these marriages go smoothly. Whether they are internal families who have feuds with us or foreign families who are potential allies, securing valuable marriages with a variety of people will spread the influence of the Nupe far and wide."
 fight_back_against_islamic_conquest: "Clashes against Islam"
 fight_back_against_islamic_conquest_desc: "Islam may have its good parts and may be somewhat present in Nupe lands, but there are political entities that take Islam to the worst degree possible and wage war against us in the name of it. We will not stand by and watch our fields burn and men die in vain, no, we will rally against these unjust wars and fight back with all that we can."

 spa_influences_of_catholicism: "Catholic Roots"
 spa_influences_of_catholicism_desc: "Catholicism in Iberia, there almost nothing that is quite as natural as this, and with the fires of the Protestant Reformation making Europe a pool of different forms of Christianity that turn away from the one true faith, Iberia is perhaps the only bastion of righteous Catholicism left. This will not break our spirit, but rather it will embolden us to do more in the name of Christ and the Holy See!"
 spa_high_seas_fleet: "Armada of the Spanish"
 spa_high_seas_fleet_desc: "Iberia has had to deal with coastal raids and threats form the sea for centuries and it has taught the various people of the peninsula to build up what naval forces they can to combat foreigners intruding on their land. Whether they be Portuguese sailors, Castilian admirals, Aragonese builders, or even Galician cartographers, we will ensure that every single part of our future armada will be specifically built to uphold the coastal integrity of Spain."
 spa_strong_colonial_authority: "The Watchful Eyes of Spain"
 spa_strong_colonial_authority_desc: "Our subjects, be they viceroys, small dukes, or local governors, know that the Spanish crown is always keen on hearing them out for what they need and what they have to say. Listening to what our subjects need is crucial to keeping them loyal, but we must also watch their every action that we possibly can should a corrupt subject attempt to collude with the enemies of Spain. There will be none who evade our watchful eyes."
 spa_tercio_reformation: "Reformation of the Tercios"
 spa_tercio_reformation_desc: "The tercios of old were innovative when they were first introduced, but as time has gone on there have been innovations in various fields that have allowed foreign infantry and cavalry to take out our tercios. Reformation is needed on the surface of things, and not only this but new tactics revolving around new technology must be integrated with our tercios if Spain is every going to be a true and proper military power."
 por_feitorias: "Promote Feitorias"
 por_feitorias_desc: "From our formative days as Portugal to where we are now as Spain, the feitorias around the world for us have been nothing but grand for goal of making more money through trade. Increasing the amount built and perhaps even converting a few into actual Spanish trading colonies could yield untold amounts of benefits for us as well."
 por_marines: "Spanish Marines"
 por_marines_desc: "The days as Portugal taught out soldiers that attacking coastal settlements from ships is something that takes time and training to master. Being a marine in the Spanish military is nothing short of an honor as it signifies that they are truly ready to be on the front of Spain's wars and colonies, fighting from coast to coast in order to secure what is rightfully ours."
 por_trade_monopolies: "Monopolized"
 por_trade_monopolies_desc: "There is only one power that can make more money from trade than we can and that power is Venice, but they are locked into the Mediterranean Sea whilst we of Spain are free to take our interests beyond the shores of the inland sea. We will monopolize what markets we can in the world and ensure that Spanish trade interests satisfied by our merchants."
 cas_the_inquisition: "The Spanish Inquisition!"
 cas_the_inquisition_desc: "Whether through promises of salvation, sending a few spare coins their way, or making them feel the pain that Christ felt when he was on the cross, the Spanish Inquisition will work to enforce the Catholic faith throughout Spain and its holdings. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition to come forth and bring unity to the masses, but they will indeed do this through the power of righteous faith and sanctioned methods."
 cas_reformation_of_cabildos: "Reformation of the Cabildos"
 cas_reformation_of_cabildos_desc: "Though the cabildo may be used to help represent the various land owners in a certain province, it is routinely vulnerable to corruption via the people running it since they are more or less governors of an entire area away from central Spanish authority. We must work to reform the cabildos into a stronger institution that can represent the various Spanish people properly and without colored glasses shaping what we see beneath the cabildo."
 cas_far_reaching_spanish_people: "Every Continent, a Spanish Flag"
 cas_far_reaching_spanish_people_desc: "Some would say that the Spanish people are spilling into whatever land they can for the sake of spreading out, but this is a simplistic way of seeing our endeavors. In reality, we strive to influence what politics we can in the favor of Spanish interests, and part of doing that means colonizing lands all across the world with strong Spanish communities."
 ara_mercenary_princes: "Princely Mercenaries"
 ara_mercenary_princes_desc: "Aragonese roots bring with them a plethora of mercenary connections as our past princes have been made to lead various mercenary companies both in and out of Iberia. Though we are steadily cutting down on how many mercenaries we use, these ties to various mercenary companies could indeed be useful for us in the future if Spain is in a tight spot."
 ara_charter_companies: "Charter Companies of Spain"
 ara_charter_companies_desc: "Why must we colonize everything with valuable Spanish families when we can instead cultivate our interests through charter companies that are supported by our military at times? Surely this method of expanding Spanish influence will bring about increased profit for us later on and few will be able to resist the pull of Spanish markets."
 ara_centralized_estates: "Command the Spanish Estates"
 ara_centralized_estates_desc: "As for what can be done with Spanish land directly underneath the crown... Well, unruly estates must be put back in line, should they not? For too long we have seen the clergy and the nobility run their own local affairs without Spanish interests being at their heart which has led to various struggles for power that boil upwards to the monarch. It is time we take firm control over these estates and make them bow to the Spanish crown once and for all."
 lon_the_true_iberian: "Truth in our Blood"
 lon_the_true_iberian_desc: "The people of Leon and those of Leonese descent know that they are indeed the true holders of Iberia and were destined to be as such had it not been for the fiends of Castile stealing power away from the leaders of Leon. Now that we are unified with the true blood of the Leonese leading the way, there will very few who can question our authority."
 lon_dominant_leonese_dialect: "The Leonese Dialect"
 lon_dominant_leonese_dialect_desc: "Much like how the Castilians slowly spread their dialect throughout their lands, Leonese will now spread throughout the land we hold and steadily assimilate other languages into it. Perhaps in the future, we can even form a foundation of sorts dedicated to keeping our language enforced without much change over time."
 lon_schools_of_iberia: "Schools of Iberia"
 lon_schools_of_iberia_desc: "To further promote the intellectual pursuits of Spanish people and to keep them on par with the likes of the rest of Europe, we must be keen on building libraries, schools, and universities all across Iberia. Basic literacy, geography, philosophy, mathematics, and science must all be taught to our people if we wish to strengthen ourselves internally."
 gal_santiago_de_compostela: "Santiago de Compostela in Galicia"
 gal_santiago_de_compostela_desc: "The city of Santiago de Compostela, grand is it not? Holding the fabeled Way of St. James's ending, the city is very much a pilgramage site for Catholics around Europe and it has led to a great deal of zealousness amongst our missionaries and priests. We need to keep them reined in as time goes on, but their zeal should not be left to wither away in our lands; they can safely promote the faith in our own land when it is needed."
 gal_bishoprics_of_iberia: "The Bishoprics of Iberia"
 gal_bishoprics_of_iberia_desc: "The bishoprics were once a key factor in the politics of Iberia and at times, clergy officials could easily hold sway over certain parts of kingdoms and duchies. The time has come to centralize power toward the crown of Spain, but we can still find use in these old bishoprics when it comes to hiring good leaders to help organize our military. They had experience with doing such in centuries past, why can't they help us out now?"
 gal_righteous_catholic_bastion: "The Rightous Bastion"
 gal_righteous_catholic_bastion_desc: "The Spanish people are and have always been righteous defenders of Catholicism throughout their time on the peninsula as independent entities. From the times of Asturias and Galicia to the times of Portugal and Aragon, our people have been loyal to the one true faith, garnering us a rather fitting reputation as a defender of the faith."
 cat_luxury_of_iberia: "Luxuries of Iberia"
 cat_luxury_of_iberia_desc: "Iberia is full of luxury goods if one can search for them in the right markets and the right communities. Places like Barcelona, Valencia, and Zaragoza should be promoted to higher standings in Spanish land so that they can truly become the epitome of an empire taking in all the trade Europe has to offer."
 cat_harbor_emphasis: "Emphasize the Harbors"
 cat_harbor_emphasis_desc: "The various harbors of Iberia are alright for now, but they need to be built up even further later on if we are to compete with the likes of the French, the English, and the Italians! Catalan cities on the coast are perhaps some of the best for building ships and promoting naval interests for Spain so those should be prioritized first, and then harbors around the rest of Iberia should be focused on."
 cat_mercantile_expertise: "Mercnatile Lens on the World"
 cat_mercantile_expertise_desc: "Emphaisis on our Catalan heritage makes us more keen on trade and naval dominance as one might expect. The glistening cities of Barcelona and Valencia are what we should be striving to make throughout all Spanish lands, and within these cities shall be grand markets that have trade power on levels the Venetians and Genoese could only dream of."
 nav_rugged_terrain_traders: "Cross-Region Traders"
 nav_rugged_terrain_traders_desc: "The Basque people are a strange sort of people in Iberia, but they're influential in mercantile politics as well as dynastic politics. These Basque connections in the French region and the in the lands of the English and Irish could be just the thing that Spain needs to profit hugely, though it will take time to ensure these connections are solid enought to build on."
 nav_blending_of_iberian_identities: "Edicts of Acceptance"
 nav_blending_of_iberian_identities_desc: "If Castilians and Leonese people can accept the Basque people into the Iberian fold, there isn't any reason why they wouldn't be able to accept others into the fold as well. The Basque language alone is enough to put off many people as it is radically different to any language around it, but seeing as it is a key facet of Spanish culture as a whole, perhaps people are becoming more accepting as time goes on."
 nav_importing_ideas: "Import Foreign Ideas"
 nav_importing_ideas_desc: "Foreigners can be met with suspicion in Spanish lands, but they shouldn't be put off forever. As time goes on, we'll foster a more diplomatically open and cordial attitude in the Spanish people. Even though they might be staunchly Catholic in their ways, culturally they can be accepting, and foreign ideas should not be much of an issue if the ideas can indeed be a benefit to our society as a whole."

 plc_prosperous_folwarks: "The Folwark System"
 plc_prosperous_folwarks_desc: "A nobleman's landholding in the Commonwealth is usually comprised of what we call a folwark. It is a large farm worked by various serfs to produce surpluses for trade that is both internal and external. So long as we can keep this system functional and perhaps reform the laws surrounding it over time, the folwark system will continue to contribute great amounts to our trade routes and our stockpiles."
 pol_jagiellonian_university: "Jagiellonian University"
 pol_jagiellonian_university_desc: "Established in 1364, Krakow's Jagiellonian University is perhaps one of the greatest places in all of Europe! It has brought in, taught, and cultivated a variety of philisophical and scientific minds the likes of which Europe could almost never live without, let alone the Polish and Lithuanian people. Going forth, Jagiellonian University will continue to be one of the brightest points in our grand Commonwealth."
 plc_the_obrona_potoczna: "Obrona Potoczna"
 plc_the_obrona_potoczna_desc: "What we term a 'continuous defense' is really a standing army that is paid for by the monarch from their own pocket. They are stationed traditionally in troubled areas or places where the border with a neighbor is not clearly defined so that Commonwealth interests are not intruded upon. Over time, this military sector of ours is going to yield for us highly trained soldiers and skilled generals who know just how to deal with enemies of all types, whether they're of Polish, Lithuanian, Ukranian, or foreign descent."
 pol_winged_hussars: "And the Winged Hussars Arrived!"
 pol_winged_hussars_desc: "As Europe moves from heavy cavalry to light cavalry, the Polish troops of the Commonwealth know that heavy cavalry are still very much able to deal great amounts of damage in battle if they are led correctly and armed with proper equipment. We will focus our efforts on cultivating the Winged Hussars as much as we can and build our military tactics around how the heavy cavalry should perform in battle."
 plc_refine_our_golden_liberty: "Refinement of Golden Liberty"
 plc_refine_our_golden_liberty_desc: "Our political doctrine: 'Our State is a republic under the presidency of the king'. It is by this statement that we abide by and the following aspects: having an election of a king by all nobles, a Sejm, a Pacta Conventa, religious freedom, legal right to rebel against a king who has violated guaranteed freedoms, liberum veto, and forming an organization to force a common political aim. By keeping these aspects of our republic enshrined and also refining them with new laws and legislation as we go forth, the Commonwealth will never become outdated nor stagnant in its politics."
 pol_royal_guards: "The Polish Royal Guards"
 pol_royal_guards_desc: "Responsibly directly for the protection of the monarch and his family, the Polish Royal Guards are set to be the peak of Commonwealth power. Fitted with the best equipment we can obtain and trained in a variety of methods throughout their lives, the Polish Royal Guards will only embolden and harden our military in the future, especially our infantry, all whilst keeping the monarch and his family safe from harm."
 plc_tempered_by_neighbors: "Tempered by Neighbors"
 plc_tempered_by_neighbors_desc: "All around us there is conflict. Swedish people? Baltic conflicts. Hungarians? Border disputes. Teutons? Old grudges and lusts for land. Russians? Ambition for land on both sides. Time and time again we have been tested in combat since our borders in the east and west are hard to define beyond a hand-drawn map, but these times of war did not break down the Polish and Lithuanian people, it only made them stronger."
 lit_success_after_success: "Success after Success"
 lit_success_after_success_desc: "The history of the Lithuanian people is vast and expansive as it is, and our history as an independent state pushing eastward has been something of a great success story. Being unscathed by Mongol attacks and actually beating them back, and then later on diplomatically annexing or invading and taking over various small Slavic states, it is all part of how good of a state we have cultivated over the centuries."
 lit_vilnius_university: "Vilnius University"
 lit_vilnius_university_desc: "Vilnius has been a hub of Lithuanian culture and grandeur for centuries now (Grand Duke Gediminas relocated the capital to Vilnius in 1323), so it is only fitting that we start up a grand university inside of it! Vilnius University will become a beacon for Lithuanian people and will serve to help bring scholars of all fields to the lands of the Commonwealth regardless of their faith."
 lit_develop_eastward: "Develop Eastward"
 lit_develop_eastward_desc: "The eastern portions of our land are full of open tracts of land that are ripe for development, but the people there are few and far between. We must subsidize these areas and begin to develop them into proper voidoeships so that they can not only contribute more taxs and manpower to the Commonwealth, but also help contribute to a stronger defensive line should any invasion come through those lands."
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 #Serbian Ideas#
 the_free_despotate: "The Free Despotate"
 the_free_despotate_desc: "Stefan Lazarevic was the first despot of Serbia, crowned with the title in 1402 by the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. Though this title was normally used to denote a subject state of Byzantium, the lack of power projected forth by the ruinous Byzantium meant that Stefan was able to rule on his own, making deals and decisions on his own for the good of all of Serbia. This title will be passed on from generation to generation and it will forever mark us as both an Orthodox bastion and a key state in the entirety of the Balkans."
 the_tenuous_diplomacy_of_serbia: "Tenuous Diplomacy"
 the_tenuous_diplomacy_of_serbia_desc: "We have had to make friends and enemies throughout all of the Balkans in order to survive. The Ottoman Empire brings with it both perilous threats but also powerful chances at greatness if we can play our cards right, but the Hungarians and Austrians to our north also provide chances at greatness elsewhere. Whatever path we choose, let us make sure that our diplomats are firmly ready to adapt to whatever situation we find ourselves in."
 hussars_of_the_hungarians: "Serbian Hussars!"
 hussars_of_the_hungarians_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is bringing with it a new age of warfare that requires us to adapt rather quickly in order to survive. Heavy cavalry with scale or plate armor is quickly becoming obsolete whilst mobility and quick strikes are becoming more and more advantageous for armies all around the Balkans. We will go along with this move to light cavalry and begin setting up our regiments of so-called 'hussars' for future battles."
 libraries_and_development_of_serbia: "Revitalize Serbia's Development"
 libraries_and_development_of_serbia_desc: "The development of Serbia as an independent bastion of Orthodox Christianity with a distinct South Slavic twist has been hampered by warfare to our south, political dealings in every direction, and attempts to expand Serbian power outward instead of consolidating power inwards. It is time that we look toward our cities like Belgrade and Novo Brdo and develop them with both libraries and schools so that our people can look to a brighter future in their own land." 
 silver_mines_of_serbia: "Luxurious Silver"
 silver_mines_of_serbia_desc: "Silver mines in Serbia are some of the most prized parts of the land and we must work to keep them both productive and safe. Not only this, but minting coins and taking on the circulation of minted coinage is going to be hard for our administration, but one that will help strengthen the independent status of Serbians as a whole in the Balkans."
 serbian_vlasts: "The Vlasts of Serbia"
 serbian_vlasts_desc: "Dividing our territory into a series of districts is a bit controversial, but it's going to be needed if we are to manage Serbian lands effectively. The governors of these vlasts will of course pay fealty to the Serbian despot and through their administrative divisions, uphold certain civilian and minor military duties, thus helping project our central authority over a larger distance."
 hadjuk_irregulars: "The Help of Hajduks"
 hadjuk_irregulars_desc: "In the rural areas near the edge of Serbian borders and in places where Serbian communities are governed by a foreign power, an irregular kind of infantry is showing up time and time again. We aren't sure how the term 'Hajduk' came about, but this term for these irregular fighters is what most state call them. If we of Serbia can hire them or even integrate various Hadjuks into our military and also look into their fighting styles for our own benefit, the entirety of our military will surely become better in terms of quality and quantity."
 
 #Air Ideas#
 tin_hinan_of_hoggar: "Tin Hinan of Hoggar"
 tin_hinan_of_hoggar_desc: "It was under her guidance in the centuries of our past that the Tuareg people found their initial footing. Her tomb lies in the Hoggar Mountains today and we of Sultanate of Agadez (as with many other Tuareg groups) revere her and her work. By acting as she did and following in her footsteps, we too can be an example to all of the Tuareg people that we lead."
 islamic_but_relaxed: "Our Version of Islam"
 islamic_but_relaxed_desc: "Though many Tuareg communities may have adopted Islam as their own religion, there are several practices and theological aspects that we retain from before we were introduced to Islam. It is this blending of traditional Tuareg beliefs with Islamic teachings that we have come to be as we are, a widespread people encompassing a great many cities and villages as well as several trade routes."
 widespread_tuareg_connections: "Widespread Tuareg People"
 widespread_tuareg_connections_desc: "Tuareg people live in both North Africa, the Sahara, and the Sahel without worry and are often the ones that can ensure safety for trade routes that go across the great Sahara. Not only this, but Tuareg people have also settled in various cities in the north and south, making our connections even wider than others might initially think. Perhaps in places like Timbuktu, Tunis, Oran, and Bornu we will see our influence increase as time goes on."
 masters_of_the_sahara: "Masters of the Sahara"
 masters_of_the_sahara_desc: "We are indeed the undisputed masters of the Sahara and this is known by many states on the northern side and southern side. We know just how to navigate the cruel sands, how to use camels to their greatest extent, and how to conduct warfare throughout the merciless sands that fill up the barrier between North Africa and West Africa. If any wish to challenge us in our domain or elsewhere, we will use what skills we have against them."
 unify_tuareg_amenokals: "Unite the Amenokals"
 unify_tuareg_amenokals_desc: "The most paramount of chiefs in Tuareg communities is called the Amenokal, and they usually lead large confederations of Tuareg people in general. Though we are slowly changing from this traditional style of ruling over own people, the amenokals are still vital to our power and we continue to respect them in day-to-day activities, though those that swear fealty to us will need to compromise on some matters concerning governance."
 civil_servant_slavery: "Civil Servant Slavery"
 civil_servant_slavery_desc: "The Ikelan (meaning 'to be black') are a distinct slave class in Tuareg society and they sometimes live in their own separate communities from the main Tuareg community, though even then they act as civil servants and such. Acquired through raiding various states in West Africa and also through various states subject to Tuareg authority, these slaves acting as civil servants of sorts will do well in maintaining the growing economy of the Agadez Sultanate."
 reexamine_tuareg_hierarchy: "Reexamine Tuareg Hierarchy"
 reexamine_tuareg_hierarchy_desc: "For centuries the hierarchy of the Tuareg people has been unchanged due to the relatively stable nature of trade across the Sahara and the nature of cyclical politics in West Africa. But as things are changing and new concepts on society and administration are making their way into our state, we are increasingly being asked by our people to reform the old Tuareg societal hierarchy. It would take time and effort and perhaps disrupt some internal relations, but perhaps this path of reformation could be for the best if we are to sustain a lasting state for the Tuareg people."

 begin_the_fulani_jihad_desc: "The states that lie around us are impious in a number of ways and also seek to bring down our righteous caliphate from where it currently stands. We will not stand idly by as these states threaten our way of life and our thirst for Islamic scholarship, no, we will wage jihad on these kafirs and infidels! To war, my brothers and sisters, to war!"
 commander_of_the_faithful_sokoto: "Amir al-Mu'minin"
 commander_of_the_faithful_sokoto_desc: "Our leader is not only the religious leader who helps administrate the Islamic laws of Sokoto, but he is also the Amir al-Mu'minin, the Commander of the Faithful. Since our inception this has been the case and as time goes on, the radiant aura that stems from our Amir al-Mu'minin will help bring more people to Islam and more people to the banners of Sokoto."
 the_pledge_of_many_emirates: "The Pledge from Many Emirates"
 the_pledge_of_many_emirates_desc: "Direct annexation and conquest is by no means the only way in which Sokoto can go about extending power throughout the region of the Sahel, the lands of the Niger River, and former lands of the Mali Empire. Through establishing firm alliances and making subject states out of various people groups, Sokoto's can become more and more influential whilst also promoting various emirs to establish emirates instead of states run by kafirs."
 indirect_warfare_of_sokoto: "Indirect Warfare"
 indirect_warfare_of_sokoto_desc: "The forests, savannah, and dry deserts of West Africa make for an interesting landscape to fight in and the Fulani people know this for a fact. For centuries they've been more pastoral and nomadic in their ways, but since Sokoto has come about there are thousands upon thousands of Fulani people settling down in cities and taking up actual gunpowder weapons to fight with. Thus, we are learning to utilize the landscapes we've lived in for centuries with these new weapons of war."
 slave_empire_of_west_africa: "Slave Empire of West Africa"
 slave_empire_of_west_africa_desc: "The distinction between a slave and a regular person in Sokoto is different when compared to how the fiendish Europeans conduct slavery. In Sokoto and indeed in many other West African states that came before Sokoto, slavery is and was common and involved working plantations and working in the military with at least better conditions than those offered by Europeans, but still they could be sold and traded around. Being that Sokoto is as powerful as it is, the trade of slaves is going to continue in West Africa for now."
 build_up_ribats: "Ribats for the Land"
 build_up_ribats_desc: "Small fortifications to protect the growing frontier and to also protect trade routes and to act as a place of pious worship, that is what a ribat is. Though not too common in West Africa, we are going to change that around and begin building them throughout the land we hold since they are very useful in holding down land that we may find to be unruly and hard to administrate."
 elected_by_islmaic_scholarship: "Islamic Scholarship Prerequisite"
 elected_by_islmaic_scholarship_desc: "The caliph of Sokoto must always be educated in Islamic scholarship and not only Maliki jurisprudence, but also various other schools of Islamic jurisprudence since religious debate is going to be around in Sokoto. By ensuring that each possible candidate of ours is firmly educated in these topics related to Islam, there will be no doubt that the caliphs of Sokoto are the most pious of all Islamic leaders."
 
 #Tibetan Ideas#
 monasteries_of_tibet: "The Holy Sites of Tibet"
 monasteries_of_tibet_desc: "The great holy sites of Tibet are never too far away. Whether they are monasteries with religious significance or monuments with cultural traditions attached to them, Tibet is full of them and our protection of them in a unified Tibetan state only deepens our legitimacy amongst the our people. There are few who can lay claim to such piety and devotion as us."
 great_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Great Works of Thangtong Gyalpo"
 great_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The Iron Bridge Maker himself has left a monumental impact on Tibet and its people, so much so that many schools and sects of Tibetan Buddhism would not be where they are today if it was not for him. His great works are too many to list off, but we can rest assured that his earthly and spiritual work will never be forgotten by us."
 household_castles_for_bonpos: "Bon Dzongs"
 household_castles_for_bonpos_desc: "The older, traditional faith of Tibet still lurks around, practiced by some communities here and there but it has largely been replaced by Buddhism as a whole. Still, some practices, such as the concept of a dzong, are prevalent throughout Tibetan communities. For the dzong in particular, it is said that in the construction of a house it is in a sense making it like a castle to protect from malevolent forces outside of it. Various rituals and practices from the Bon faith go along with this of course and it helps serve to keep our people very vigilant and protective."
 the_nyingma_school: "The Nyingma School"
 the_nyingma_school_desc: "It is the oldest tradition of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism and incorporates some practices and rituals from the old Bon faith. The traditions of the Nyingma school are usually passed on via loose oral networks of its practitioners and it is because of how loose it can be that others outside of our main faith can find solace in it. Though, we will always encourage them to come toward the true path of Buddhism, that will not change."
 the_kagyu_schools: "The Kagyu Schools"
 the_kagyu_schools_desc: "Born in the 11th century by Indian Mahasiddhas (someone who embodies the 'siddhi of perfection') Naropa, Maitripa, and Marpa Lotsawa, the Kagyu school grew into a number of other different sub-schools. The Karma Kagyu school, Drikung Kagyu school, Taklung Kagyu school, Shangpa Kagyu school, and the Drukpa Lineage are all children of the Kagyu tradition and with their favor and assistance in both civil and military matters, Tibet will be all the more powerful and unified."
 the_sakya_school: "The Sakya School"
 the_sakya_school_desc: "The 'pale earth' school comes from the second period of translation of Buddhist scripture from Sanskrit into the Tibetan language in the late 1000s and was firmly established by the 'Great Sakyapa', Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. The Sakya school has a historical foundation of authority over various people unlike what others might think at first glance since, the Sakya lamas were given authority from the Yuan Dynasty to govern over Tibetan land as a vassal state of sorts. We would do good to utilize the governing capability of the Sakya religious officials as Tibet gains more ground in the world."
 the_gelug_school: "The Gelug School"
 the_gelug_school_desc: "The foundations of the Gelug school date to the life of Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) and his actions. He founded the Ganden Monastery where the Ganden Tripa is the spiritual leader of the entirey school itself, but the most influential political figure that also holds religious significance has undoubtedly been the Dalai Lama. The Gelug school stresses a variety of matters just as all schools of thought do, but the Gelug school emphasizes vinaya (monastic discipline) more so than others, and it is this disciplined attitude that we will cultivate in our hearts and minds, both in times of peace and in times of war."

 languages_around_us_desc: "All around the Shan people there are various people groups that have their own history, language, and traditions. As the Shan people go forth, it will become necessary to become more culturally understanding of these various groups no matter if they are of our own faith or not."
 centralize_the_shan_states: "Centralize the Shan States"
 centralize_the_shan_states_desc: "The various states of the Shan people have been quite decentralized throughout their history. The Pagan Kingdom attempted to round up the Shan states into a confederacy of sorts, but it barely held together for more than a few decades before falling apart. If we are to be different this time around, we must work on a central administration that can pass effective laws and be heard to the point of all Shan states answering to the central administration."
 hill_and_jungle_fights: "Highland and Tropical Warfare"
 hill_and_jungle_fights_desc: "Learning to move quickly and with intent is key to surviving in the regions that the Shan people call home. Fighting in the jungles and hills is no easy task, but it has trained our soldiers over time to make precise and calculated movements with ease. We'll be sure to use this skill against any state that seeks to stand against our intentions."
 contest_for_the_irrawaddy_valley: "Contest for the Irrawaddy River"
 contest_for_the_irrawaddy_valley_desc: "The great Irrawaddy River is prized by so many communities and states near the Shan people that it is not shocking to see that there are so many that would wage war over it. We are no different in this sense because we too have interest in the Irrawaddy River and what it provides. It can truly become an agricultural and commercial heart for the Shan people."
 communities_that_stand_together: "The Shan Stand Together"
 communities_that_stand_together_desc: "Through the hard times of the past and being part of various great kingdoms and dynasties, the Shan people have come to know who is friend and who is foe, but most importantly, who is their family. The Shan move and work to protect each other from those who seek to smite them down; they will not be divided again."
 the_chronicles_of_our_leaders: "Chronicles of our Leaders"
 the_chronicles_of_our_leaders_desc: "One consistent form of historical documenting that the Shan people have done over the centuries is that of chronicles of former leaders. Granted much of the previous ones have mythical elements embedded within them, the more recent chronicles of Shan rulers are more accurate and true-to-life. Keeping a running history of our rulers into the future will help enshrine legitimacy within the royal family."
 inter_religious_dialogue: "Encourage Religious Dialogue"
 inter_religious_dialogue_desc: "Whilst accepting different cultural traditions is one matter, accepting different faiths is another to many in the Shan administration. Our work now comes toward promoting peaceful and helpful dialogue between religious minorities and those of our true faith so that we can see them as not just filthy non-believers, but rather people deserving of peace and prosperity like so many others."
 
 #Moroccan Ideas#
 al_qarawiyyin_university: "University of al-Qarawiyyin"
 al_qarawiyyin_university_desc: "Founded by Fatima al-Fihri in 859 in Fez, the past dynasties of Morocco have kept the university as a madrasa and as a place for higher education. With a great accumulation of manuscripts, texts, scholars, students, and worshippers from all over the Islamic world and beyond, it is in our best interest to keep the university open to all in our domain. Not only this, but we should also expand it when and where possible so that our strive for educational prowess is never hindered."
 pious_past: "Pious Past"
 pious_past_desc: "Morocco has been the seat of the Almoravid Dynasty and the Almohad Caliphate from centuries past; not only this, but the Fatimid Caliphate and the Caliphate of Cordoba also attempted to garner influence in Moroccan lands before as well. Such piety that has been imbued within our people should not go unnoticed by us in our current state for we have the foundation to become a truly wondrous Islamic bastion in the west. On the frontier of Africa and the Islamic world, Morocco will stand tall and as an example to many."
 fleet_bases_of_morocco: "Fleet Bases in Morocco"
 fleet_bases_of_morocco_desc: "The inland parts of Morocco are arid and hot to a good degree, but the coasts are where value can be found at little cost. Fleet bases and dockyards fit for a burgeoning and expanding navy is what Morocco has needed and will need in order to survive. Threats to the north and to the east are going to utilize the wide open coasts against us, let us see to it that they are not given up without a great fight out on the water first!"
 promote_corsair_efforts: "Promote Corsair Efforts"
 promote_corsair_efforts_desc: "Pirates and corsairs of the North African coast, they take no mercy on their enemies and rule the waves in which they call their own. Morocco has historically been a good haven for them since contracts can be made with said corsairs against the Christian north. By utilizing them even more in the future, we'll stand a better change at defeating any enemies we have out at sea."
 revered_and_honored_leaders: "Revere Our Leaders"
 revered_and_honored_leaders_desc: "It is right and just that we look up to the past leaders of Morocco, those who once stood tall against threats to our people and helped the region itself prosper despite the challenges set forth. As new great leaders come and go for the Moroccan people, we should build a proper tomb complex so that they are never forgotten by future generations and so that their tales and stories may live on well after they have left this physcial world."
 centralize_power_curtail_tribes: "Centralize Authority; Curtail the Tribes"
 centralize_power_curtail_tribes_desc: "The tension between ethnic Moroccans and ethnic Berbers, its constant issue that we will need to deal with somehow. Tribal connections are present all throughout Morocco and they can play a huge role in politics as we have seen in the past, but we should not be afraid of trying to rein in said tribes. Centralizing power and authority is going to be crucial to keeping the internal aspects of Morocco stable and prosperous."

 #Portuguese Ideas#
 dom_henry_the_navigator: "Infante D. Henrique of Portugal"
 dom_henry_the_navigator_desc: "The central figure to the Portuguese people that is Henrique of Portugal (also known as Prince Henry the Navigator) should be revered by both the people and our administration. His acts of developing early maritime trade for the Portuguese Empire would help initiate and sow the seeds for the Age of Exploration. Along with this, he would help lay the foundation for our rise onto the world stage of international politics."
 feitorias: "Feitorias!"
 feitorias_desc: "What better way to facilitate trade than to open up what is essentially a Portuguese-founded entrepot for trade activity? It will not only bolster our own trading prowess and power abroad, but it will also also help increase our influence over sea routes and land routes that surround the feitoria. Lining our pockets with coins from the world over will become easier than ever before!"
 naval_bases_and_slave_trade: "Naval Bases and the Slave Trade"
 naval_bases_and_slave_trade_desc: "To help secure our hold on trade power in various sectors and to help facilitate the rather profitable slave trade, we will need a variety of naval bases scattered about on our coastal holdings. Portuguese ships will be able to resupply and repair at these bases before going back off to patrol trade routes, engage in overseas conflicts, or carry forth the wonders of Portuguese trade."
 lucrative_gold_exploits: "Lucrative Gold Exploits"
 lucrative_gold_exploits_desc: "Now that gold is streaming into our administration, we will need to spend it wisely. Investing the gold into production techniques that go forth to extracting more from the land (especially precious metals) will benefit Portugal very nicely in the future without compromising the economic integrity of our state. At least, that is what we hope."
 portuguese_marines: "Portuguese Marines"
 portuguese_marines_desc: "With the advent of overseas wars and conflicts, the Portuguese infantry (more specifically, the Portuguese marines) need to be well versed in how to attack and defend in a variety of situations. From amphibious invasions and defenses in a number of harrowing conditions, they will be hardened and trained well in fending off any who dare make war with the Portuguese."
 portuguese_inquisition: "The Portuguese Inquisition"
 portuguese_inquisition_desc: "And to subjugate the land further in favor our noble and righteous authority, bringing forth the knowledge of Christ to new land we seize is what will be done. We must and will hold divine authority over the land we hold and the people will know this in their hearts and souls without the slightest of derivation."

 secure_the_trade_monopolies_desc: "The other Europeans would have the Portuguese ousted out of the competition on the high seas, they would keep the trade routes to themselves and force us into economic submission! We cannot let this happen or even begin to happen! We must be ready at all times with a grand fleet to keep our trade companies, colonies, and overseas charters safe from the clutches of other Europeans!"

 #Greek Ideas, specifically for Greece itself#
 GRE_ideas: "Greek Ideas"
 GRE_ideas_start: "Greek Traditions"
 GRE_ideas_bonus: "Greek Ambition"
 rememeber_the_strato_da_mar: "Remember the 'Stato da Màr'"
 rememeber_the_strato_da_mar_desc: "The Republic of Venice is powerful indeed and has held sway over several key parts of the Adriatic Sea as well as the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterannean Sea. Though the time of Venice in the glory of the sun is coming to an end, the work they did in Greek lands is certainly not. The prosperity they kept in Greek islands as well as Greek mainland towns is what we are striving to keep alive and well. This in turn is leading us to promote a more expansive navy and a wider range of potential trade partners."
 protect_byzantine_arts: "Protect Byzantine Art and Architecture"
 protect_byzantine_arts_desc: "It was during the 10th century to approximately the time of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 that the revival of Byzantine art occurred in the lands of Greece. Mainland Greece certainly benefited from this revival since it was endowed with many great churches and cathedrals, but we must not rest yet! These sacred and beautiful places are always in danger of being raided and destroyed by invaders and thus we must protect what gives us lasting prestige and beauty."
 greek_resistance: "Greek Resistance"
 greek_resistance_desc: "When the Turkish forces came in from the east, many Greeks did not simply bow down to their onslaught and conquering emirs and pashas. They stayed reserved and hidden away, selectively peaking out to struggle against the Turkish forces so that they were not completely decimated. This resistant Greek spirit lives on without end to this very day no matter who the invader is or where they come from."
 diaspora_of_greek_people: "The Greek Diaspora"
 diaspora_of_greek_people_desc: "The Turks not only conquered our territory, but they also helped make for a great exodus of Greek people from the mainland. Toward the rest of Europe did they head off to, serving in other courts around Europe in the hopes that one day they may return home and serve a truly Greek state. That time has now come and as they arrive back, our good name will spread around the likes of Europe without failure."
 lifted_from_the_ground_up: "From the Depths of Poverty"
 lifted_from_the_ground_up_desc: "As Turkish authority tightened on Greeks, the rules also tightened in certain areas, leading to Greeks becoming impoverished and left to worse conditions than how they were after the Fourth Crusade. Now that we can sustain ourselves and function properly, the Greek people will come back up from the depths of poverty and rise back to the urban cities that they once knew. Coastal trade centers will come back to life and our once grand cities will know splendor like never before."
 revival_of_greek_thinking: "Revival of Greek Intellect"
 revival_of_greek_thinking_desc: "Greece as a region has been the center of many great philisophical innovations as well as the site of great advances in ancient and classical technologies. Honoring this past by promoting Greek intellect in schools and universities will put the Greek people back on the map of scientific and philisophical innovation."
 enduring_heritage: "Enduring Heritage"
 enduring_heritage_desc: "No matter who they were in the past, no invader could dislodge and remove Greek culture from the land. Try as they might to spread it thin or shift it from the great cities of Athens, Sparta, Thessaly, and many others, these foreign occupants have done nothing but further contribute to the enduring legacy and heritage of the Greek people. We are without perfection, that much is certain, but we are not without the greatest living spirit in all of Europe."
 
 #Galician Ideas#
 santiago_de_compostela: "Santiago de Compostela"
 santiago_de_compostela_desc: "Inside our great city of Santiago de Compostela is the hallowed cathedral in which the Way of St. James ends at. A pilgramage sight for Christians in several communities inside and outside our borders, Santiago de Compostela will serve as the foundational place by which Galicia rises up and in the world. Few will be able to match our piety and honor and we will use this to our advantage."
 reestablish_the_bishoprics: "Reestablish the Bishoprics"
 reestablish_the_bishoprics_desc: "In the time of the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries, the old bishoprics of Galicia were not just religious authorities that Galicia communities looked up to, but they were also political players that meddled in matters of governance normally reserved for dukes and kings; some bishoprics were even seen as warlords since they could wield the weapons of levied armies in opposition to others around them. Reviving these old bishoprics could be very beneficial to Galicia as a whole, but we will need to keep a very tight leash on them so that they do not destabilize the state as a whole."
 claimant_of_iberia: "Claimant of Iberia"
 claimant_of_iberia_desc: "Many have forgotten the times when Galicia was a true power in Iberia. Many simply see Castile, Aragon, and Portugal as the crowned powers that shall hold Iberia in its entirety, but Galicians are not bound to this destiny by any means. The chains imposed by the crown of Castile and the subsequent power grabs by all three aforementioned powers will not stay for long, for Galicia will take to the sword and musket to break free. Iberia will not stay silent, it will be contested for!"
 attracting_christian_pilgrims: "Attracting Christian Pilgrims"
 attracting_christian_pilgrims_desc: "Santiago de Compostela may be Christian pilgramage site, but times have changed and there are plenty of people outside of Iberia that have forgotten or who do not know of the Way of St. James. Let us send envoys out to various lands across Europe and beyond to encourage people to visit our land so that they can know not just the beauty and wonder of Galician land, but also the piety of its people from all walks of life."
 galician_town_charters: "Galician Town Charters"
 galician_town_charters_desc: "To help organize city growth and city planning, we should take to heart the notion of town charters that was taken up by our past rulers. Such town charters will allow for more careful and closer governance so that cities are not left to manage themselves in an unregulated fashion. In time, aspects like city councils, guilds, and social mobility will be a reality within Galician towns."
 revive_compostela_for_galicia: "Revive Compostela"
 revive_compostela_for_galicia_desc: "Some may say Santiago de Compostela is a lonesome city in the hills and that it is a wasteland, but those people know not of what they say! Though the city is not as grand as say, Toledo or Barcelona, it still has great potential for economic growth and urbanization. Promoting its regal status from before and funding new infrastructure projects that can turn the communtiies within into functioning and profitable sectors will help bring not only the area around Santiago de Compostela into greatness, but Galicia as a whole."
 power_of_the_irmandinos: "The Irmandinos!"
 power_of_the_irmandinos_desc: "When people think to the Irmandino Revolts, some think they were just rowdy peasants who wanted the heads of nobles whilst others look to them as heroes of the lower classes. It would be beneficial to Galicia to paint them in a more heroic light so that those troops that we levy and train from rural communities are more inspired to fight for Galicia. We certainly do not want a second set of Irmandino Revolts, but we also must learn to harness the tenacity and will that those once brave fighters had in themselves."

 #Danish Ideas#
 sound_toll_defense: "Sound Toll Defense"
 sound_toll_defense_desc: "We control a great amount of trade power thanks to the Sound Toll and it makes up a decent portion of our trade revenue inside of the core of Denmark. If we are to see ourselves secure and prosperous, we need to first make sure the walls of our beating heart are safe from all harm."
 margrets_kalmar_legacy: "The Legacy of the Kalmar Union"
 margrets_kalmar_legacy_desc: "The Kalmar Union that was instituted by the great Margaret I of Denmark has had its rough spots, certainly, but it is not without its lasting legacy on the land. The lands of Scandinavia have been disunited for several decades before our time, but we must have the strength and the will to see to it that the region is united! The Danish people already look to its royal administration with great pride, it is time that we ensure that pride stays in their hearts and minds."
 danish_economic_overhaul: "Economic Overhaul of Denmark"
 danish_economic_overhaul_desc: "The way we have done finances up until now has been rather disorganized and fairly decentralized; some say it is why Denmark has been unable to project its power outward like it was once able to in the times of Cnut the Great. These ways of decentralized finances must be done away with! An economic overhaul internally in the administration and in the naval sector (since the latter is a large part of our expenses) is necessary so that our treasury and our salaries are dealt with on equal ground by educated and skilled workers."
 claims_across_the_north: "Ancestral Claims in the North"
 claims_across_the_north_desc: "From the Danelaw in the British Isles to the lands of Scandinavia itself and even parts of the eastern Baltic Sea, Denmark remembers what it had in the past. Trade posts and conquered territory alike, the Danish will obtain what it once lost so long ago and soon, all of the northern lands will see just how powerful we are. What we must refine in our conquests though, is how we take in and govern foreign people so that they are not revolted by how we speak, write, and conduct business on a day-to-day basis."
 northern_trade_hegemon: "Northern Trade Hegemon"
 northern_trade_hegemon_desc: "The trade routes of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are absolutely key to the survival of the Danish economy and we have always been a solid contender for controlling both regions. The Hanseatic League, the English, the Swedish, and the Russians all seek to tie down Denmark in terms of trade, but we must work against them effectively to steer trade contracts and trade ships into our favor."
 the_question_to_us_christians: "Questions of Faith"
 the_question_to_us_christians_desc: "Faith has been key to the people of Denmark for a very long time, but so as the dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church itself. We must ask ourselves harrowing questions on what path we will choose as the Protestant Reformation goes forth: What teachings will guide us? What theology is even remotely correct? What will the political outcome be if choose a certain faith over another? Whatever we choose amidst the fire and smoke, the Danish people will surely be happy with it."
 legal_overhaul: "Legal Reformation and Compilation"
 legal_overhaul_desc: "To keep up with continuous technological advances as well as administrative reforms, a comprehensive legal code that can be revised as time goes on should be made and distributed across Denmark to other administrative sectors so that laws can be enforced as much as possible."
 
 #Ayutthaya Ideas#
 mandala_system_ayu: "The Mandala System"
 mandala_system_ayu_desc: "Through the mandala system of governance, we are able to take hold of areas extending outward from our central city. These various places under our mandala system, they must pay tribute to our capital regularly and contribute military forces to the mutual defense when needed. What we need to watch for is when these parts of our mandala system begin to get restless and hungry for power; such ambitions could easily rip the kingdom apart."
 hindu_buddhist_kingship: "Hindu and Buddhist Kingship"
 hindu_buddhist_kingship_desc: "Gone are the days of paternal kingship as was found when King Ramkhamhaeng of Sukhothai ruled the land. Our ruler, the 'chakkraphat', shall take upon traditions and customs from both Buddhism and Hinduism and combines them into one elegant being that will make the world revolve around him so long as he adheres to the laws of the land."
 institute_the_uparaja_position: "Institute the Uparaja Position"
 institute_the_uparaja_position_desc: "To help us govern and to help secure the succession to the throne of Ayutthaya, we should make room for a sort of viceroy/prince. In addition to this position, we should give favor to the king's children, preferably the eldest son, so that he can learn to govern in accordance with his father and the court around him."
 influx_of_trade_links: "Influx of Trade Links"
 influx_of_trade_links_desc: "Our capital of Ayutthaya is a place of immense trade and great prosperity. With people from China, India, and other places around us and even beyond us coming to the capital for trade deals, we should be ready to negotiate at any point so that the revenue stream of our kingdom is only ever increasing. Business never stops flowing in Ayutthaya, that is surely one key aspect of it."
 need_for_the_corvee_system: "A New Manpower System"
 need_for_the_corvee_system_desc: "Wars in South East Asia are often decided not by technological differences, but by who has the larger army in battle. To supply our armies and to ensure that we always have the larger military force at the ready, we need to institute a new system called the 'corvee system'. With some captured people being brought back to serve in various position on the lower rungs of society, Ayutthaya will have a consistent supply of manpower to draw upon."
 compile_the_dharmasastra_legal_code: "The Dharmasastra Legal Code"
 compile_the_dharmasastra_legal_code_desc: "To help govern the land, we should draw upon not only Thai traditions but also on Hindu customs too since they have been very influential in the history of the Thai people as a whole. We may not adopt the caste system that is prevalent out in the west, but we should adopt a bureaucracy of officials set in a heirarchy that can be managed and maintained by the administration of Ayutthaya."
 center_of_thai_literature_production: "Center of Thai Literature"
 center_of_thai_literature_production_desc: "With our splendid governance over the land, it should be no surprise that the people in villages and cities are becoming more and more creative. Literature in the Thai tradition may have been slow to develop before our time, but we have essentially broken the barrier that stood in the way of our people before, allowing them to flourish in writing various poetic literature in the 'rai', 'khlong', and 'klon' forms."
 
 #Ilkhanid Ideas#
 restoration_of_the_past: "A New Age of Ilkhans"
 restoration_of_the_past_desc: "Founded by Hulagu Khan, son of Tolui and grandson of Ghengis Khan, in 1256, the Ilkhanate ruled much of what was the southwestern portion of the once grand Mongol Empire. It was an empire that held tenuous power over the region of Persia and neighboring areas to the west and north, but its power was great enough to continuously challenge the Mamluk Sultanate for control of the Levant. Still, the Ilkhans were subordinate to the Great Khan of the east situated at the head of the Yuan Dynasty, but this is no longer the case. Our leader is no longer subservient to a far away khan, but rather leads the empire on his own accord."
 internal_tolerance: "Promote Internal Tolerance"
 internal_tolerance_desc: "From Hulagu to Baydu, the Ilkhans were relatively indifferent to religions though they kept Buddhism around in Persian lands for quite some time despite the region being majority Islamic in essence. It was not until Baydu's overthrowing by Ghazan that Islam was adopted as the official faith of the Ilkhanate in 1295 (after a majority of Mongol emirs had already converted to Islam), though it was not until the death of the influential Mongol emir Nawruz that religious tolerance was achieved to a great degree. We would be wise to learn from Nawruz's failures and flaws and work to consistently improve upon our religious tolerance."
 improve_upon_past_science_inquiry: "Improve our Scientific Outlook"
 improve_upon_past_science_inquiry_desc: "A great observatory in Maragheh was built by the early Ilkhans, though since then chaos has reigned throughout the region and as such scientific inquiry has been left to gather dust in a lonely corner. With our establishment of power in the region and the coming about of the Ilkhanate once more, we could easily patronize and rework our inquiry into scientific matters since times of peace and stability will help keep great buildings like observatories and libraries intact and functional."
 versed_mongolian_conquests: "Versed in Mongolian Conquests"
 versed_mongolian_conquests_desc: "Though the Mongol Empire may be gone and fragmented beyond repair to many, what is not gone is the way the Mongol Empire conquered people and eased them into the fold of other conquered people. We would do well to learn and possibly refine this method of conquest as time goes on so that the Ilkhanate can continue to project its power in the future whilst also ensuring an easier path to peace for our realm."
 ghazan_style_reform_edicts: "Inspiration from Mahmud Ghazan"
 ghazan_style_reform_edicts_desc: "Mahmud Ghazan was not only the first Islamic Ilkhan, but he was also a very capable and well-meaning ruler. During his reign, he reformed Ilkhanid finances and fiscal policy (including unified measurements of coinage and weights), issued a new census for the empire, ordered the construction of new hospitals, hostels, schools, and posts for trade, and he also reformed the way in which edicts in the empire's administration were handled. Emulating this reform-minded nature of Ghazan is going to be hard to do, but to keep the Ilkhanate alive is to look to the future and actively engage with it, not to rely purely on the past."
 zamburak_cavalry_arm: "Develop Zamburak Cavalry"
 zamburak_cavalry_arm_desc: "Whilst holding the title of 'Ilkhan' is important as it lends legitimacy in our reign, it is important that we do not stay stagnant in military strategy like our ancestors may have. Persian lands make heavy and large cannons hard to carry around, so we must devise new ways of incorporating gunpowder weapons into our ranks. One innovative invention is what some call the 'Zamburak', literally meaning 'wasp', and it is a swivel-mounted small cannon mounted on the back of camels. Utilizing them in our military will greatly improve our effectiveness in future battles and can be seen as an evolution of our ancestors tactics."
 reformed_yam_system: "Reformed Yam System"
 reformed_yam_system_desc: "Much like how Mahmud Ghazan improved upon the Yam system in his time, we too will take to improving it in our time. Constructing more dedicated and central roads for messengers, merchants, civilians, and military personnel to travel on as well as building up new relay stations along the way for our people will ensure that the roads are efficient enough for us. Not only this, but we will employ people to maintain the roads over time so that they do not wither away into impassable patches of land."
 
 #Hungarian Ideas#
 order_of_the_dragon: "The Order of the Dragon"
 order_of_the_dragon_desc: "Founded in 1408 by Sigismund von Luxembourg, King of Hungary at the time, the Order of the Dragon was a chivalric order founded whilst the crusaders were still ongoing. The initiates were required to defend the cross and fight the enemies of Christanity, especially the Ottoman Empire since they were the biggest threat back then. Though they are declining in importance as time goes on, their legacy gives our troops and military a zeal unlike those around us. Who is to say that the Order of the Dragon is ever truly dead?"
 learning_from_debasing_coinage: "Learn to not Debase Coinage"
 learning_from_debasing_coinage_desc: "Whilst Sigismund von Luxembourg was active in the defense of Hungary and its foreign policy, these activities and engagements required great amounts of money. They required so much money that Sigismund regularly debased currency to the point where Transylvanian peasants revolted in 1438. We need to learn to never step toward this path again, and to ensure that our monarch can handle financial matters in a just way that does not invoke rebellious sentiment."
 southern_contention_with_turks: "Southern Tension"
 southern_contention_with_turks_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is an existential threat to the Kingdom of Hungary, none doubt that. The southern border with them is almost always in contention and it is rare that we are not involved in some sort of conflict against the Ottoman Empire. Should the time come, we need to ensure that our military is large enough and strong enough to withstand any prolonged war against the fiends to the south."
 bibliotheca_corviniana: "Library of Hungary Royalty"
 bibliotheca_corviniana_desc: "We recognize the importance of the manuscripts and texts being produced as a result of the Renaissance and many courtiers and nobles are collecting them for future keeping and reading. If we can perhaps build up a royal library of sorts to store these grand texts and manuscripts, we'll be able to attract more people to read about them and become educated on various matters, contributing to the ongoing scholarly dialogue in Hungary."
 recognize_the_importance_of_firearms: "The Importance of Gunpowder"
 recognize_the_importance_of_firearms_desc: "With gunpowder weapons becoming more and more common, it is becoming clear to all of Hungary that refining the art of making firearms and implementing them formally into our military is needed. If we lack in this aspect, we will be vulnerable to invasions as well as rebellions, possibly even from the Black Army itself if things get to that point."
 reorganize_hungarian_taxes: "Organize Hungarian Taxes"
 reorganize_hungarian_taxes_desc: "The traditional tax laws of Hungary are quite outdated and needlessly complex, having not been changed in decades now. We can refine and streamline them into something more suited to a growing kingdom so that revenue is not only increased, but also easier to manage in general."
 institute_the_decretum_maius: "Institute the 'Decretum Maius'"
 institute_the_decretum_maius_desc: "We have known just how much power the palatine (a high level official in our court) has over judicial matters. The power he has is seen by some to be just, but many of the court know that it is a needless stumbling block that we have had to work around for a long time. It is time that we institute the 'Decretum Maius' and officially cut down the power of the palatine and instead strengthen county magistrates instead since they are the ones that work close with the lower classes of Hungary. This will help bolster our administrative capabilities far into the future."
 
 #Cascadian Ideas#
 integration_of_native_tribes: "Cascadian Acceptance"
 integration_of_native_tribes_desc: "Unlike other places around the vast continent we lie on, we of Cascadia are not so keen on destroying the lives and communities of native people who already live in these lands. We would rather assimilate them and do good trade with them so that Cascadia can be at peace and also prosper from mutual cooperation. Though this won't always be easy to do, it is much better than ruthlessly excluding all natives from our land."
 expanding_trading_and_production_measures: "Expansive Trade and Production"
 expanding_trading_and_production_measures_desc: "Trade is essentially what Cascadia was founded upon, and production of furs as well as other minor resources is what we also partly rely on to keep us afloat. By taking the time to refine our methods of trade and production we can meet the demands that overseas markets have such as across the Pacific Ocean and even across this vast continent we live on."
 frontier_settler_traditions: "Settling the Frontier"
 frontier_settler_traditions_desc: "Cascadia's land is by no means easy to traverse the further you go toward the mountains. Settlers braved these uncharted trails and setup small villages that grew in size to upstart towns and cities, but these foundational times were also filled with dangers from wildlife and hostile natives. All Cascadians willing to settle the frontier will need to be versed in firearms and survival training, and we know that many will strive for this training since the frontier is a lucrative place for those daring enough to venture into it."
 cascade_mountains: "The Cascade Mountains"
 cascade_mountains_desc: "Tall and steep mountains mark the barrier between the western coast of these lands and the great interior plains where wide open tracts of land are roamed by a variety of people. Traversing the Cascade Mountains requires endurance, stamina, and keen senses, for an ambush from enemy forces could start a deadly skirmish in the perilous heights. Not only this, but surviving off what the land can provide is also needed when moving through the Cascade Mountain, which is why most of our soldiers are also capable hunters and survivalists."
 puget_sound_trade_rights: "Our Pacific Inlet"
 puget_sound_trade_rights_desc: "The inlet on the Pacific Ocean that Cascadia relies heavily upon is becoming more and more popular as time goes on. Trading vessels from all across the Pacific Ocean and even from the Atlantic Ocean stop by in our friendly ports along the sides of the inlet, garnering us more trade revenue, so why not impose some trade taxes and such? We can slowly start projecting our power off the Cascadian coast and ensure that our harbors are even safer, promoting stronger trade ties and attracting even more merchants later on."
 the_need_of_the_pacific_ocean: "Extensive Naval Matters"
 the_need_of_the_pacific_ocean_desc: "Without a fleet of some kind, Cascadia will simply be only half as strong as it really could be. We need to promote naval affairs and the production of ships throughout Cascadia's coast so that we are not left to the mercy of foreign powers and what ships they might have. Plus, the plentiful forests in our land will make for a great amount of material for future ships."
 to_govern_a_hinterland: "To Govern a Hinterland"
 to_govern_a_hinterland_desc: "Cascadia was, when it was a colony still, governed as if it were a hinterland (meaning a place where resources are extracted and shipped off elsewhere far away in order to be processed and refined). Now that we are free from the greedy hands of our former overlords, we can work on governing Cascadia for Cascadians solely. We can address the needs of our people and work on government reforms and legislation at our own pace, ensuring that we are accountable to the people we protect and care for."
 
 #Sonoran Ideas#
 logistics_of_sonoran_land: "Logistics of Sonora"
 logistics_of_sonoran_land_desc: "To move supplies and materials around Sonoran land is something of an issue for those not used to the region since, well, the arid heat can often lead to people slowing down and animals as well as people suffering from heat stroke and exhaustion. Taking all of this into account and setting up supply stations as well as carving out designated paths throughout the arid lands we inhabit will help cut down how costly moving supplies around is."
 promises_of_future_revenue: "We Promise Future Fortune"
 promises_of_future_revenue_desc: "Whilst not all of Sonora can be used right now, we are developing infrastructure in various places to promote larger and more numerous settlements. Garnering investors for this initiative is not going to be easy, but if we can start a campaign that promises future revenue from these places in exchange for a grant of money and resources now, we will be able to expand Sonora's internal source of revenue and power."
 gold_of_sonora: "Gold Attraction"
 gold_of_sonora_desc: "If it was not for gold and other precious minerals, Sonora would not be what it is today. Indeed the allure of wealth from gold has brought many to Sonora and made them stay indefinitely, but we are much smarter than our former overlords who once governed over us, for we are not just going to let the gold miners run our economics into the ground through inflation. Instead, we will take a firm economic approach that is intent on mitigating inflation as much as possible."
 rifle_riders_of_sonora: "Sonoran Rifle Riders"
 rifle_riders_of_sonora_desc: "Muskets and rifles are what rule these lands now; the old ways of spears and arrows used by the native people is long gone. Our people, both civilian and military in nature, are going to be expected to be able to handle muskets and rifles with care and fire them with precision, and our formal core of officers and commanders are going to be well versed in how to utilize cavalry and infantry fighting in hot Sonoran lands with long range weaponry. Getting up close and personal is something we do not want to do."
 resist_authority_from_afar: "In Defense of Sonora"
 resist_authority_from_afar_desc: "Putting up fortifications like walls of stone throughout Sonora is hard enough as it is as they take a long time to build and require immense amounts of water and food to maintain, but the ones we do have are going to be absolutely pivotal for our defense. Any invaders looking to ravage our lands are going to have to get through our fortifications guarding vital rivers and streams, and even our own towns will be equipped with at least some form of defensive structures like watchtowers or fortified outposts."
 slow_but_steady_growth: "Showing Promise"
 slow_but_steady_growth_desc: "From our inception as a colony, the lands here in Sonora did not look good for widespread settlement and even to this day we find large tracts of land open to the howling wilderness and baking heat of the sun. But, we have grown immensely since our inception and our independence, and we are working toward building a strong, unified Sonoran state that few if any could break down. No matter how far apart they are, Sonoran people will stand united together, with hands together for celebrations and hands on rifles when defending."
 the_politics_of_sonora: "Sonoran Politics"
 the_politics_of_sonora_desc: "The stabilization of Sonoran politics is perhaps the most key aspect of keeping this state together since, if our politics are not stable and different factions lead different parts of the country, they can easily rip apart the population's loyalty as a whole. Formalizing political parties, how people are represented, and how officials will be elected will ensure that the blooming Sonoran state continues to prosper."

 #Crimean Ideas#
 the_reprisals_from_the_golden_horde: "Unjust Reprisals in Crimea"
 the_reprisals_from_the_golden_horde_desc: "In the 1300s and early 1400s, the khans of the Golden Horde used Crimea as a playground of sorts, riding through and striking down various communities when civil war was brewing and forcing people into military service when they initially refused. We have been taught to always be ready for whatever war or conflict may come our way, and our weapons are always within reach for when we need to defend what is rightfully outs."
 capitalize_on_golden_horde_failure: "The Withering Horde of Gold"
 capitalize_on_golden_horde_failure_desc: "Without the influence from the Golden Horde, the khans of Crimea can live freely and without much worry. They failures in politics and military organization that led to the downfall of the Golden Horde are opening paths for us to make gains in the east toward Sarai, so why not take the chance and stake our claim in the land whilst our old overlords are struggling to survive?"
 legitimacy_in_blood: "Legitimacy, through Blood"
 legitimacy_in_blood_desc: "Succession in the Crimean Khanate is bathed in blood for the most part. The heir chosen by the current khan is going to need to fight for his life if he wishes to maintain the throne, and it is this display of power and might through combat that instills legitimacy in our heirs when they come to power. If a khan cannot lead an army into battle and win effectively, then what good is he?"
 turkish_friends: "Turkish Friends"
 turkish_friends_desc: "The Turkish people of Anatolia are strong in their conviction and powerful with their military and navy. They have taken interest in our lands before but not for pure conquest; instead they seem more interested in utilizing us on a more one-to-one scale. Making friends with the Turkish people will undoubtedly help us in the long run and give us more routes of diplomacy for the Islamic world, despite it being still quite far from home."
 refining_our_trained_cavalry: "Refine Crimean Cavalry"
 refining_our_trained_cavalry_desc: "Firearms are what we will need if we seek to survive into the coming era. Equipping our cavalry with firearms and training them to fire and reload them effectively is not going to be easy, but with the help of Turkish military officials and a sustained effort on our own part, we can cultivate a cavalry arm that is more effective than any other."
 black_sea_slave_trade: "Profits from the Slave Trade"
 black_sea_slave_trade_desc: "The slave trade is partly how we make our money since, raiding and looting Christian lands is so easy at times and there are plenty of buyers on the market throughout the Black Sea. Continuing the slave trade and perhaps investing in it elsewhere should continue to help our people profit nicely."
 cossack_friends: "Cossacks? Cossacks!"
 cossack_friends_desc: "What is a 'cossack' to us Crimeans? Are they enemies, or are they friends? Beyond border disputes and some petty squabbles, the cossacks are remarkably similar to our people in their military prowess organization. If we can establish effective diplomatic ties with the various cossack groups throughout the Pontic Steppe and bring some into our fold, our military will be unmatched in how effective it is and how fluid it can be in times of war."

 #Ottoman Ideas#
 kapu_kulu_and_eyalet: "Kapu Kulu & Eyalet Organization"
 kapu_kulu_and_eyalet_desc: "The military forces of Europeans and Muslims around us are something that we should not only learn from, but also strive to be above as time goes on. Organizing our military into two sections, a central force and a peripheral force, will help with this and instill a sense of discipline in the core part of our military as well as the outer part since both will be relied upon as we continue our fight into Europe, Africa, and Asia."
 spahi_cavalry: "Sipahi Cavalry"
 spahi_cavalry_desc: "Cavalry has been a key component of our military since the time we were a mere Beylik. Our ancestors of the Seljuk Empire even depolyed Sipahi cavalry which attests to the history of the unit itself, but we of the Ottoman Empire are in a much different time compared to our ancestors. Our Sipahi must learn more skilled strategies and tactics, how to use gunpowder weapons whilst on their horses, and also how to conduct themselves in line with our Janissaries and artillery."
 turkish_artillery: "Ottoman Artillery"
 turkish_artillery_desc: "Whilst the Europeans and other Muslim states around us progress very little in terms of gunpowder technology, we are absolutely keen on using the fiery material to its greatest extent! Grenades, weapons that are larger than muskets but smaller than cannons, even cannons that seem almost too big to even be fired properly, all of this will be utilized and tried out by the Ottoman military. Only the best designs will survive the test of time and this strive for gunpowder prowess will make our artillery outdo anything Europe or Asia can put forth."
 organized_pashas_and_eyalets: "Of Pashas and Eyalets"
 organized_pashas_and_eyalets_desc: "Setting up strong administrative divisions will be key in governing our growing empire. Pashas and Eyalets can be where we start from and from there, further organization can commend and bring a sense of unity to far off lands under our control; we just need to make sure we keep track of these various pashas and eyalets so that corruption does not get out of hand."
 from_karamursel_do_we_dominate: "From Karamursel Onward"
 from_karamursel_do_we_dominate_desc: "When we took Karamursel, our fleet was small and not able to compete with the likes of Venice or other powers in the Mediterranean Sea. Now that it has been under our control for a long while and our navy has been building up in a variety of ways, Karamursel will become the nucleus of our various fleet, allowing us to field a great amount of galleys and merchant ships that can take on the likes of Venice and Genoa."
 multi_functional_spahis: "Sipahi Funcationality"
 multi_functional_spahis_desc: "The professional Sipahi cavalry are not just used in combat; unlike the Janissaries, the Sipahi are also given grants of land called 'timars' and are expected to enforce law and order in these lands they are given. As a sort of informal police force of sorts yet also an effective cavalry force, the Sipahi variable role in the Ottoman Empire means that we will need more of them as time goes on, especially as our empire continues to expand into new areas."
 claim_the_caliphate: "The Ottoman Caliphate"
 claim_the_caliphate_desc: "Few if any in the Muslim world have reached our height and claimed as much power as we currently have. The piety in our rulers and the power we are gathering as time goes on should show all in the Islamic world that we, the Ottoman Empire, are the true protectors of Muslims from outside forces. Though some Islamic states would defy our righteous authority, in time they will submit to our authority either through peaceful talks or the fires of war."
