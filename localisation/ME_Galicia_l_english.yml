 #Events:
 ME_Galicia_Events.1.t: "The Situation of Galicia"
 ME_Galicia_Events.1.d: "Although the Irmandinos were crushed in the past by Castile, disunity has plagued Galicia since then. The nobility is split between the lesser and higher nobles, of whom the former has been banding up with the general populace to truly create an independent Galicia, getting rid of all the corrupt privileges that the Crown of Castile had given to the latter. Perhaps it is time to start preparing as well."
 ME_Galicia_Events.1.a: "We must prepare for the coming storm."

 ME_Galicia_Events.2.t: "The Galician Civil War"

 ME_Galicia_Events.3.t: "End of the Revolt"

 ME_Galicia_Events.3.a: "Our fate is now sealed."

 ME_Galicia_Events.4.t: "Galician Civil War"

 ME_Galicia_Events.5.t: "Disorder in Galicia"

 ME_Galicia_Events.6.t: "Influencing the Santa Hermandad"
 ME_Galicia_Events.6.d: "The crown of Castile is trying to enforce their laws on us using the Santa Hermandad, a militia force specifically dedicated to that specific job. We can accept this and gain some of their gratitude, or we can try to look for other supporters."
 ME_Galicia_Events.6.a: "Galicia stands alone!"
 ME_Galicia_Events.6.b: "Portugal can assist us"

 GALI_enforcing_our_laws_title: "Enforcing our Laws"

 GALI_develop_galicia_desc: "The lands of Galicia are subject to many pilgrims, all seeking to visit our holy sites. By developing this land and making it more inviting, we can perhaps apply more taxes and strengthen our crown control over the area."
