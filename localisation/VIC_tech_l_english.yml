 adm_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "My secretary of state assures me that the switch to clover as a fodder crop and the addition of the turnip in a 'four field' rotation will increase yields in agriculture. I am inclined to promote this idea."
 adm_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "The invention of steam power has led to significantly better means of transportation. With railroads we can transport goods and people very quickly over vast distances."
 adm_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "In the modern world tolerance and equality are becoming increasingly important. Our advisors suggest that we look into the possibility of abolishing the idea of state religion in favor of secularism."
 adm_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "In the 19th century in Europe and North America, there were movements advocating universal male suffrage. The democratic movement of the late 19th century, unifying social democrats, particularly in Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand used the slogan Equal and Common Suffrage."
 adm_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "Making machines from regulated replaceable parts will save a lot of resources as the whole machine won't have to be replaced if just one part of it breaks."
 adm_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "Assembly lines, designed for the sequential organization of workers, machines and parts, would allow faster manufacturing of goods along with decreased workload for the workers."
 adm_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "Progressivism is the support for or advocacy of improvement of society by reform. As a philosophy, it is based on the idea of progress, which asserts that advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization are vital to the improvement of the human condition."
 adm_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "With the increased supply of electricity we are now able to bring it to all major factories. That would allow them to produce greater amounts of products."

 dip_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "The availability of canned food played a crucial role in 19th century, feeding the enormous armies and offering explorers and colonialists a taste of home in unfamiliar lands."
 dip_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "A steamship, often referred to as a steamer, is a type of steam powered vessel, typically ocean-faring and seaworthy, that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically drive propellers or paddlewheels. The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s."
 dip_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "The modern history of petroleum began in the 19th century with the refining of paraffin from crude oil. The Scottish chemist James Young in 1847 noticed a natural petroleum seepage in the Riddings colliery at Alfreton, Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery. In 1846, Baku had the first ever well that drilled with percussion tools to a depth of 21 meters for oil exploration."
 dip_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "Wooden warships have become very vulnerable to explosive or incendiary shells. Protecting the ships by iron or steel armour plates would help them survive naval combat."
 dip_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "It's often vital to know quickly if something significant happens. With the help of a telephone we could deliver messages across great distances almost instantly."
 dip_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "After extensive research, William Soltau Davidson commissioned the cargoship Dunedin to be refitted with a compression refrigeration unit for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the Dunedin sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage."
 dip_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "The radio would not only allow us to quickly deliver messages to other countries and the army, but also provide the masses with information and propaganda."
 dip_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "The dreadnought, larger, better armed and better armored than any ship before, would certainly become the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century."

 mil_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "Originally developed for siege purposes, the howitzer fired a high angled projectile over the fortifications and into the town inside. The field howitzer, a lighter more mobile variant, would fire an explosive shell above enemy troops. Mixed with other artillery types, it added to the effectiveness of artillery brigades."
 mil_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "The percussion cap, introduced circa 1820, was the crucial invention that enabled muzzleloading firearms to fire reliably in any weather. The percussion cap replaced the flint, the steel 'frizzen', and the powder pan of the flint-lock mechanism."
 mil_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "The Minié ball, or Minni ball, is a type of muzzle-loading spin-stabilized rifle bullet named after its co-developer, Claude-Étienne Minié, inventor of the Minié rifle. The development of the Minié ball was significant because it was the first projectile which was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun."
 mil_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "A rifled breech loader is an artillery piece which, unlike the smooth-bore cannon and rifled muzzle loader which preceded it, has rifling in the barrel and is loaded from the breech at the rear of the gun. The spin imparted by the gun's rifling gives projectiles directional stability and increased range. Loading from the rear of the gun leaves the crew less exposed to enemy fire, allows smaller gun emplacements or turrets, and allows a faster rate of fire.
 mil_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "European armies continued to develop bolt-action rifles through the late 19th century, adopting tubular magazines and later box magazines. The Mauser Gewehr 98 was considered the epitome of this type of action, and its descendents became the standard against which all such rifles are measured. World War I marked the height of the bolt-action rifle's use, with all of the nations in that war fielding troops armed with various bolt-action designs."
 mil_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "The mechanism of the Maxim Gun employed one of the earliest recoil-operated firing systems. This system made it vastly more efficient and less labor-intensive than previous rapid-firing guns."
 mil_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "Indirect fire is aiming and firing a projectile without relying on a direct line of sight between the gun and its target. Aiming is performed by calculating azimuth and elevation angles, and may include correcting aim by observing the fall of shot and calculating new angles."
 mil_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "Although technology had dramatically changed the nature of warfare by 1914, the armies of the major combatants had not fully absorbed the implications. In the face of modern warfare, digging in was standard practice. To attack frontally was to court crippling losses, so an outflanking operation was the preferred method of attack against an entrenched enemy."
