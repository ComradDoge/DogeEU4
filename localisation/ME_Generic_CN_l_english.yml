 ME_CN_Events.1.d: "Upon our unfortunate but necessary break from the mainland, countless friend and families were suddenly separated by more than a simple ocean. Thankfully, it would seem as though national boundaries do not always mark the splitting of one populace into two distinct peoples. Throngs of settlers flock to our lands, ready to work and seek out their lost confidants, wherever they may be. Such is the strength of human bonds, surpassing a seemingly infinite expanse of deep blue seas and breaking the boundaries of a nation. The people may once again rest easy."

 ME_CN_Events.8.t: "Negotiating with Overlord"

 ME_CN_Events.9.t: "Our Subjects' Requests"
