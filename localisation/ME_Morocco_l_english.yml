 ME_Morocco_Events.1.t: "Status of Ceuta"
 ME_Morocco_Events.1.d: "In days of old, both the Marinids and the Nasrids of Granada held interest in the North African city of Ceuta. The local noble family of Banu al-Azafi was being consistently influenced by both sides, trying to outbid each other and bring the locals under their wing. With our reconquest of the city, we are given a choice on whether we want to keep the city as ours, or try to give up the city for the sake of our friendship with the Nasrids."
 ME_Morocco_Events.1.a: "We must forge a friendship with the Nasrids."
 ME_Morocco_Events.1.b: "Ceuta is rightfully Moroccan."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.2.t: "Support From [From.GetName]"
 ME_Morocco_Events.2.d: "With our alliance with [From.GetName], we have been granted the genuine support of the [From.GetAdjective] nobility. With their acts of kindness, our military is feeling reinvigorated and is ready to face the christian invasion, should it now dare to come. Furthermore, the newly obtained funds will be instrumental in preparing defenses and expanding our forces.\n\nHowever, this comes at a cost. The [From.GetName] expect us to become their vassals, and we must honor the agreement, should we survive a decade ahead of us."
 ME_Morocco_Events.2.a: "Great news!"
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.3.t: "Returning the Favor"
 ME_Morocco_Events.3.d: "As per our agreement with the Moroccans we had survived a decade since they have offered us their support and therefore we must obey the treaty and become their fiefs, else we will face the full wrath of the Sultans. While it would be dishonorable to defy the agreement, becoming their vassals is most certain to usher in a new decline for the Nasrid dynasty."
 ME_Morocco_Events.3.a: "We will honor the agreement anyway."
 ME_Morocco_Events.3.b: "It's treason, then."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.4.t: "Return of the Moors"
 ME_Morocco_Events.4.d: "The foolish christian Kingdoms thought that they would expel the muslims and then there would be peace. That could not be further from the truth, for the Moors have returned, and we will resettle the territories left barren by their cruelty. As such, many families are migrating from Morocco, descendants of those that once used to live in those territories. Old manors are being returned to the dynasties that have been wronged. Businesses are being reopened and the golden age of Iberia is soon to return."
 ME_Morocco_Events.4.a: "Welcome them back in Andalusia"
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.5.t: "Landing the Conquests"
 ME_Morocco_Events.5.d: "With our undergoing conquest of Iberia, there's an influx of warriors flocking in to aid us in our reconquest of Al-Andalus. Coincidentally, the conquests are also providing us with a lot of land that we could grant to our mighty warriors, our loyal nobles. Alternatively, we could try to emulate the tolerance of the Andalusian Caliphate and let the christian nobles keep their lands."
 ME_Morocco_Events.5.a: "Grant it to the holy warriors."
 ME_Morocco_Events.5.b: "Grant the lands to the nobles."
 ME_Morocco_Events.5.c: "Let the christian nobility keep these lands."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.6.t: "Support from the East"
 ME_Morocco_Events.6.d: "With our diplomats sent to the east, we have gained a powerful ally in our struggles against the christian kingdoms. As a token of friendship and cooperation, they have offered to provide us with additional funds, manpower or with help in statecraft. However, we can only get one out of those favors, and therefore we are faced with a dilemma."
 ME_Morocco_Events.6.a: "Request Funds."
 ME_Morocco_Events.6.b: "Request Men for the Army."
 ME_Morocco_Events.6.c: "Request Help in Administration."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.7.t: "Marrakesh and the Hintata"
 ME_Morocco_Events.7.d: "The Hintata Berbers are the prime deciding players in the politics of Marrakesh region. With the integration of their lands into our realm, [Root.Monarch.GetName] needs to decide whether [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wants to seize the lands from the tribes, possibly upsetting them, or continue the policy of autonomy for the Hintata, albeit with increasing our grip on the region this time around."
 ME_Morocco_Events.7.a: "Seize the Land! The sultan's viziers will make better use of it."
 ME_Morocco_Events.7.b: "We cannot appropriate the valleys, yet."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.8.t: "Former Capital"
 ME_Morocco_Events.8.d: "In the ages past, the previous Moroccan dynasties of Almohads and Almoravids used to reside in [344.GetName]. We too, could take their route and return to this glorious city. The city is filled with prestigious institutions and mosques. It could use more investments from the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]."
 ME_Morocco_Events.8.a: "Make it the capital!"
 ME_Morocco_Events.8.b: "It lacks in splendor."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.9.t: "The Cult of Sufis in Sous"
 ME_Morocco_Events.9.d: "Under the guidance of Imam al-Jazuli, the muslims in the valley of Sous have been graced with a really pious sufi saint. Under his guidance, they have been blessed with a prayer book Dala'il al-Khayrat, as well as spiritual guidance. It is no surprise then, that his disciples started to proselytize about his pious life. Those institutions today grow the piety and are increasingly turning the land more accepting of the sufis. But is mysticism the right way?"
 ME_Morocco_Events.9.a: "Let us embrace and support the sufi institutions."
 ME_Morocco_Events.9.b: "Expel them!"
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.10.t: "The Sharifian Dynasty of Sa'adis"
 ME_Morocco_Events.10.d: "Before our integration, much of Tafilalt has been ruled by the Sa'adi dynasty, a family that claims they are Sharifian, meaning they can trace their lineage to Muhammad himself. This fact has garnered them much popularity in the country. With much chaos still in the court, perhaps one of the Sa'adis could split through the cracks and quickly advance through the ranks, eventually taking control over the country. With their fame, it would not be inconceivable."
 ME_Morocco_Events.10.a: "They shall rule Morocco."
 ME_Morocco_Events.10.b: "They will serve well as our subjects."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.11.t: "The Pashalik of Timbuktu"
 ME_Morocco_Events.11.d: "Following the Military Expedition by Ahmad al-Mansur of Morocco in 1590 into the Sahel against the Songhai Empire, the lands were subdued and given control of to the Pashalik of Timbuktu, a political entity established by the Moroccans to rule over the conquered the territories. Originally ruled by Pashas appointed by the Sultans of their conquerors, the Pasha would later come to be elected by the Arma people.\n\nOur expedition to the Timbuktu is complete and our foes have been defeated. With the difficult part done, we need now decided how we will rule those territories."
 ME_Morocco_Events.11.a: "Establish the Pashalik of Timbuktu."
 ME_Morocco_Events.11.b: "Bah! We can handle it ourselves."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.12.t: "Imports from the South"
 ME_Morocco_Events.12.d: "With our reestablishment of a flourishing trade relationship through the Sahara, goods previously thought exotic are now flocking into our markets. We have the freedom to prioritize certain goods and encouraging certain types of goods. But what do we actually need from across the Desert? The markets of Sahel are overflowing with ivory, exotic fruit, various cloth products and slaves."
 ME_Morocco_Events.12.a: "We need to expand our Sugar plantations."
 ME_Morocco_Events.12.b: "Let us import ivory for our buildings."
 ME_Morocco_Events.12.c: "We should focus on growing our trade in the Sahel."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.13.t: "A Nasrid Subject"
 ME_Morocco_Events.13.d: "The Nasrids of [From.GetName] have agreed to become our vassals. In light of this, we are once again in control over the entirety of Muslim Iberia, however small it may be. With this in mind, perhaps we should have them adopt a different identity in order to further our goals and legitimize our ambitions - the reconquest of Iberia. To achieve this, they shall claim the title of the State of Cordoba - the most prosperous and the most prestigious muslim realm that used to rule these lands."
 ME_Morocco_Events.13.a: "We will restore the muslims to Iberia."
 ME_Morocco_Events.13.b: "Cool story."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.14.t: "The Emergence of Isawiyya"
 ME_Morocco_Events.14.d: "Out of the teachings of Al-Jazuli in Sous all of these years ago comes a Sufi school founded by one of Jazuli disciples' sons, the Isawiyya, also known as Aissawa. Founded by Muhammad ben Issa, it has been getting very popular among our subjects, and especially in Meknes, where it has its spiritual centre, the Zawiya. It is considered to be the most mystical Sufi Order to come out of this region of Maghreb."
 ME_Morocco_Events.14.a: "Encourage this Establishment!"
 ME_Morocco_Events.14.b: "The most mystical Sufi Order...?"
 ME_Morocco_Events.14.c: "Ok."
 
 ME_Morocco_Events.15.t: "The Moroccan Influence"
 ME_Morocco_Events.15.d: "The Moroccans are having an increasingly large influence in the politics of our country. This is far from ideal, but it may have to be a necessary evil we have to cope with." #ai only
 ME_Morocco_Events.15.a: "Their influence will only make our internal strife worse!"
 ME_Morocco_Events.15.b: "Let them meddle, if it means their help is to arrive."
