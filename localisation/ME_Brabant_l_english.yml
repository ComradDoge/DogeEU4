 BRB_northern_renaissance_title: "Northern Renaissance"
 BRB_northern_renaissance_desc: "Antwerpen, as the centre of early 15th century trade, was heavy in wealth and knowledge, and thus bore the first fruits of the renaissance in north-west europe. These fruits gave the prosperity to think, and thus criticise. Leading to a movement for church reform called the Devotio Moderna, calling for clergy to act piously. The Imitatio Christi was written, criticising how the clergy acted, while still not questioning traditional practices. It spread like wildfire. Who knows what seeds this criticism plants in our people's minds."
 BRB_humanism_title: "Embrace Humanism"
 BRB_humanism_desc: "A new form of religious thought has been spreading throughout our people, pricing life above all, pushing for acceptance of all religious thought, and tolerance of unbelievers. It has been a great boon to our nation, with this religious thought practicing peaceful prosperity even as religious reform shakes the rest of europe. Many wise yet threatened thinkers have escaped to our cities, and now further our industries, trade, and technology. We might be able to invite the progenitor of this thought to our court, and bask in his innovative mind, given someone has not gotten ahead of us."
 BRB_leuven_title: "University of Leuven"
 BRB_leuven_desc: "Recent development of the province has lead to serious demand for a new university, however, a university already stands at the town of Leuven, famous for its scholars and professors. Surely the better option would be to expand this prospering educational institution then attempt to build a new one from the ground up, lest we divide our educated and suffer the consequences."
 BRB_flanders_title: "Pacify Ghent"

 BRB_richest_province_title: "Riches of Brussels"
 BRB_richest_province_desc: "Brussels has developed amazingly from its pentagon. It now sprawls inbetween administrative provinces, and is clearly the largest city of the lowlands.

 BRB_forcelimit_title: "Enforcing Obedience"
 BRB_forcelimit_desc: "Duke Phillip the good of Burgundy has rebuilt this duchy's economy from its ashes. Wars and flagrant spending emptied our treasury, and inefficient administration destroyed our income from prospering cities and fiefdoms. The duke reformed our systems, hugely improving efficiency and leading to a truly able governmental apparatus, saving us from our woes. It now stands to order that we use our military experience in the name of the Duke himself, as his favoured Duchy of the lowlands. We shall crush those who oppose him."

 BRB_loon_title: "Conquer Loon"
 BRB_loon_desc: "Loon has sat just out of reach of our duchy for a long time. Naturally, it should be ours, as can be seen from how fits our side of the Maas. Conquering it will also confirm our ability to the pope, as one of his bishopics fail to defend their own land."
 BRB_mechelen_title: "Council of Mechelen"
 BRB_mechelen_desc: "Before we struck out on our own, Mechelen was the home of a great council to burgundian rulers, with many wise minds and impeccable prestige, it was truly the court of its age. We should emulate the court and bring back the learned men, for there is never too much knowledge."

This ceremonial space was built by Phillip the Good of Burgundy, and was used to hold the meetings of the States-General. We would be a fool to not continue his acts, and invest in the wonderful hall for future meetings with advisory councils."
 BRB_center_of_lowlands_title: "Center of Lowlands"
 BRB_center_of_lowlands_desc: "As the largest state in the lowlands under Burgundian rule, we enjoy certain privileges. We should encourage the use of french to invite more of their favour to our courts, lest someone else gets in the way of our prosperity."

It should satisfy their demands for now."

 ME_Brabant_Events.1.d: "Your efforts to restore the prestigious council of Mechelen have resulted in a strange cacophony of individuals, some wise, some learned, some experienced and some aren't quite sure how they got there. Among these individuals are a few particularly talented people, which deserve patronage, but we lack the resources to help them all. So who shall it be, my duke?"
