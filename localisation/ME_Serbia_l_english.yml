 Serbia_amass_wealth_title: "Amass Wealth"

 Serbia_improve_the_navy_desc: "For many years, our minor kingdom had lacked a coast, and with that, had lacked a navy.

We must build up our fleet for our future needs."

Although this means we own cities such as Constantinople, we do not have full control of the straits and we are rendered unable to take advantage of this.

 Serbia_Remove_further_title: "Control Heartland of Ottomans"
 Serbia_Remove_further_desc: "The next land that we desire to acquire is the heartland of the Ottomans itself - central Anatolia and expansion further into the east.
