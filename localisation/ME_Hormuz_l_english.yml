 ME_Hormuz_Events.1.t: "Religious Fracturing"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.1.d: "Our realm is incredibly fractured, being divided among several religions. With Hormuzi Sunni natives on our island, through the colonies in Ibadi Oman, finally reaching to the Khaleeji Shia territories, all three major Muslim Denominations are present in our country. This is of course, doing no wonders to our religious unity, resulting in feelings of distrust and general discontent. It might be beneficial to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to convert to the Ibadi denomination, or even to the Shi'ite one, considering the alliance it could bring with the Shi'ite persians."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.1.a: "Let us maintain the rule of the current elite."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.1.b: "The Shi'ite are gaining an upper hand."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.1.c: "The majority of our colonies are Ibadi, let us suit ourselves to them."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.2.t: "Determine the Future"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.2.d: "With our choice of religion complete, we must decide how we will treat other religions from now on. Of course, many would choose to repress other religions and try to forcefully convert them to our denomination, but that might be a fickle matter in our diverse country. Instead, we can opt out for a pathway of tolerance, that would keep our country divided, but would hopefully bring longterm stability."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.2.a: "We must root out all heretics!"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.2.b: "Let us enforce dialogue between all religions."

Duis semper eros nisl, eget consectetur ex blandit dictum. Donec id semper sem. Suspendisse pharetra porta sapien. Duis cursus imperdiet neque sed tempor. Proin eget rhoncus mauris, in egestas leo. Donec hendrerit leo mi, nec condimentum nunc ullamcorper in. Curabitur sed massa erat. In varius gravida dolor a gravida. In hac habitasse platea dictumst."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.3.a: "Promote the new business."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.3.b: "Indeed!"
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.4.t: "The Defeat of the Imamate"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.4.d: "Despite the conquest of the Omani Coast and the subsequent expulsion of their Imams to the Hajar mountains, their pitiful state still dares to incite rebellion and unrest in our possessions. Only way to end their cruel existence is to completely eliminate them from the maps of Arabia and the Middle East. This is why, in the year $YEAR$, we have decided to finally bring a finish to the Omani chapter in the local history. Say your last goodbyes, Omani Imams."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.4.a: "Crumble, Oman!"
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.5.t: "The Old Hormuz"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.5.d: "In ages past, only in the oral traditions and in the old annals of our kingdom, it is said that the city of Hormuz used to lie on the coast of Mogostan. Due to the defense concerns regarding the powerful Persian realms, we would eventually move to what is nowadays called in island of Hormuz. With our reconquest of the northern coast, we may choose to return and rebuild some of the old ruins into what once stood as an important entrepot in this area."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.5.a: "We shall return to Old Hormuz!"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.5.b: "We will remain on the island."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.6.t: "Gujarati Outposts"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.6.d: "The Gujarati have for decades been one of our favorite trading partners. Sunni Land of Commerce on a Hindu continent, their trade ports are always sure to be welcoming and filled with people willing to commit to trade. As such, with our direction on expanding our trading operations in India, Gujarat and the ports around it should be our first targets for investment!"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.6.a: "Establish the Outposts."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.6.b: "We have other plans for those ports..."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.7.t: "Merchants in Coromandel"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.7.d: "The tip of India, Coromandel, has to be one of the most important trade regions to control in all of the Indian Subcontinent. In the middle of the naval route between Arabia and China, an innumerable amount of ships pass through every day. With many of our merchants already in Madurai and the Malayalam lands, establishing further outposts should not be much of an issue and would benefit us greatly."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.7.a: "We shall make more visitations than ever!"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.7.b: "A bloody conquest is what we lust!"
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.8.t: "Bengali Shipyards"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.8.d: "With the policy of increased state diplomacy and the support of the Burghers, our merchants now feel safe travelling much further. As such, many of our merchants now travel to Bengal, where the Ganges river flows into the Ocean, and where our merchants can find solace in one of the many Bengali shipyards. Establishment of outposts here could benefit us greatly."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.8.a: "We will gladly anchor in their ports."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.8.b: "Those do sound great..."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.9.t: "The Spice Route"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.9.d: "As our merchants circumnavigate India, more and more of them reach the ports rich in spices in Malacca, Pasai and Aceh. With our merchants reaching so far, and our ambitions naturally leading us towards where cold, hard ducats are to be made, it was only natural that we struck some spicy deals with the locals. Will we honor our agreements and established the promised outposts, or will we opt out for a more aggressive approach?"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.9.a: "We will honor our agreements."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.9.b: "The Route must be controlled directly."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.10.t: "The Hormuzi Merchant Families"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.10.d: "Traditionally, our country is filled with many merchant families, all vying for power in this increasingly commerce-oriented country. Many of them have ties to other arabian families, especially of Yemen. As our country goes more and more in the direction of accumulating wealth, their importance and influence grows evermore. Due to this [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to double down on appeasing those families, striking a new deal with them and agreeing to establish outposts."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.10.a: "Personally, I quite like Hormuz."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.11.t: "Arrival of Merchants in Malacca"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.11.d: "The arrival of Hormuzi Merchants in Malacca hasn't been a shock. Arabian merchants have travelled to Nusantara for centuries, paving the way of the conversion of local indianized kingdoms to Islam. But lately, more than that has been happening. More and more merchants from Hormuz are being found in the various ports of Southeast Asia, not just the muslim ones. While the influence this will have is not yet fully understood, one thing is certain: Islam spread in Southeast Asia will be positively impacted."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.11.a: "Dar al-Islam has been reconnected to Nusantara."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.12.t: "Influence of [target_ORM.GetAdjective]"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.12.d: "With more and more merchants from [target_ORM.GetName] arriving in our ports in [Root.GetName], many of our native traders have begun converting to the [target_ORM.Religion.GetName]. After all, being brothers of faith gives them better deals, right? Well, while originally, only a few people had converted, this has been spiraled out of control and now the majority of the residents are part of the religion."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.12.a: "Such is Trade."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.12.b: "Fascinating, perhaps it would benefit us if we converted ourselves."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.13.t: "This is a hidden event, if you see this, then not our fault."
 ME_Hormuz_Events.13.d: "see title"
