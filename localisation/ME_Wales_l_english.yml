 ME_Wales_Events.1.t: "Eisteddfodd of [Root.GetYear]"
 ME_Wales_Events.1.d: "As expected, this year's eisteddfod does not seem to differ from last year. As ler usual,  [Root.GetMonarch.GetName] is greeted by many familiar faces and several fresh ones. Will those artists make a grand debut this year? As the ceremony begins, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is embraced by the magic of the festival, completely captivated by the various arts. However, eventually the event concludes and a new champion bard must be chosen out of so many so great. The choice of the jury will not be a simple one."
 ME_Wales_Events.1.a: "This art captivates me."
 ME_Wales_Events.1.b: "A hard choice to make, but I think this one is best."
 ME_Wales_Events.1.c: "I made my choice."

 ME_Wales_Events.2.t: "Fall of Lloegyr"
 ME_Wales_Events.2.d: "For decades, nay, centuries, the English Lion kept us down, weak and crippled. Under their oppression, our people were targetted and suffered great calamities. With our unlikely yet incredible turnaround, we have not just toppled them, but overpowered them, turning the tables and gaining the initiative. Today, we could be the ones passing Laws in Lloegyr Act. Or we could just turn the cheek."
 ME_Wales_Events.2.a: "Let us show them what it means to be repressed."
 ME_Wales_Events.2.b: "Reliving the glories of our past."

 ME_Wales_Events.3.t: "Like a Dragon"
 ME_Wales_Events.3.d: "The status of the [Root.GetAdjective] as a great power has lead many to ponder a new name for the state. \"[Root.GetName] is too simple, not glorious enough\" - some think. In this great debate however, there do seem to be clear winners. Let us pick the name that suits us best. After all, it will remain with us for centuries more."
 ME_Wales_Events.3.a: "Time for a Cambrian era."
 ME_Wales_Events.3.b: "A traditional name like Cymru suits are best."

 ME_Wales_Events.4.t: "Richard ap Meryk"
 ME_Wales_Events.4.d: "A wealthy merchant of Welsh origin has approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with the most bizarre proposition. He mentioned the theories about circular earth and how there might be new lands and trade routes to be found through the Atlantic Ocean. Willing to commit to verifying those theories, he is requesting a royal charter that would allow him to fund an expedition to the west. Alternatively, we could employ him as a means to an end, since such action would also permit him to follow through with his plans."

 ME_Wales_Events.6.t: "The Welsh Senedd"
 ME_Wales_Events.6.d: "The English rule left us with many of their institutions still alive and kicking. One of them is their parliament which has taken the name of \"Senedd\". Though our [Root.GetNobilityName] used to hold similar meetings, the ratification of the parliamentary powers has been a major change for us. We should make a choice whether we should continue to hold the meetings."
 ME_Wales_Events.6.a: "Focus on modernization."
 ME_Wales_Events.6.b: "It's a tool to please the commons!"
 
 ME_Wales_Events.7.t: "The Clans of Yore"
 ME_Wales_Events.7.d: "Centuries of English rule and a few centuries more of their neighborhood led to the disappearence of the traditional celtic clan system from our state. With the national resurgence, we could take an inspiration from our gaelic kin and have the clan system restored in our state. We could also roll with the wind, and keep it the way it is, hoping that fewer differences in our social castes will lead to greater stability and cohesion."
 ME_Wales_Events.7.a: "Promote the Clans."
 ME_Wales_Events.7.b: "We need them not."
 
 ME_Wales_Events.8.t: "The Future of the Clans"
 ME_Wales_Events.8.d: "Being relatively isolated from the rest of the Celtic nations has left us with a situation quite different to theirs. While Ireland, Mann and Scotland have powerful castes of the Clans, we only have feudalized manor lords acquired from England. However, we could promote the reestablishment of the clans as a way to divulge power in our court and to form a group that would be more staunchly opposed to the advance of the English nobles."
 ME_Wales_Events.8.a: "We must ensure their loyalty."
 ME_Wales_Events.8.b: "Limit their influence."
 ME_Wales_Events.8.c: "Grant them further privileges."

 ME_Wales_Events.9.d: "Of Welsh heritage, John Dee has become renowned as a scientist pursuing a noble craft of alchemy. Though insofar relatively unsuccessful, we hope that in the near future, he will be able to make great strides in progression of his field. We are certainly in need of ways to turn lead to gold and, should such a method be found, we will be sure to monopolize on it. Capitalize. Capitalize on it."
 ME_Wales_Events.9.a: "An excellent alchemist!"
 
 ME_Wales_Events.10.t: "Fate of the Welsh Marches"
 ME_Wales_Events.10.d: "As of $YEAR$, our territories in Wales are organized and governed through many different ways. Some of the lands are beholden to the crown itself, being ruled by the Princes of Wales, while others belong to the power Welsh marchers who have been granted vast lands at the border with Wales. Whatever the case may be, we might want to tighten our grip on the Welsh to increase our power level."
 ME_Wales_Events.10.a: "Favor the establishment in [england_target.GetName]."
