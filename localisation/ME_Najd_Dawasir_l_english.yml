 NAJ_egypt_title: "Prince of Egypt"
 NAJ_egypt_desc: "The connection of Egypt to the Arab World used to be scarce at best. But since the conquest of Egygpt in 639, Egypt has become an inseparable part of the Dar al-Islam and its grain is inconsequential to the prosperity of our state. We must take full control over it."
 NAJ_iraq_title: "House of Wisdom"

 NAJ_holier_than_thou_desc: "Our school, Hanbali, has been pushed to the sidelines. In the meantime, the other schools of Islams have diverged from the truth of Allah. Many may find our actions as patronizing and condescending, but it is true, we are holier than them."

 ME_Najd_Events.1.t: "Hanbali Authority"
 ME_Najd_Events.1.d: "The four main Maddhabs (schools of thought within the jurisprudence) are Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali. In this assortment, Hanbali is the odd one out, as all three other schools occupy massive swathes of land and control lots of territories. In fact, Hanbali has only recently taken this spot, as the Zahiri school preceded it in this ranking. This irrelevance of Hanbali leads many scholars of the other schools to repress the rulings of our Ulema. We cannot allow this to continue! Though, adopting a more aggressive tone might make us some enemies in the dar al-islam." 
 ME_Najd_Events.1.a: "Hanbali's teachings are the only way forward!"
 ME_Najd_Events.1.b: "We should aim to be a moderate state."
 
 ME_Najd_Events.2.t: "I am a Hidden Event!"

 ME_Najd_Events.3.d: "As the bustling city of [Root.GetName] expands, the previously perfect industries of Date farming and Camel breeding are slowly being replaced by more luxurious ones. Indeed, as the city had gained famed and notoriety, many artisans have moved into the city, kickstarting the very first bookmaking worshops and the first weaving businesses. Decades have passed since then, and [Root.GetName] has a choice. We may support one industry, which one will it be?"
 ME_Najd_Events.3.a: "It is §YCloth§! that is now dominant."
 ME_Najd_Events.3.b: "Let us grow our §YPaper§! industry."
 ME_Najd_Events.3.c: "Horses and Camels are the best of our §YLivestock§!."
 
 ME_Najd_Events.4.t: "Ambitions of a Nimble State"
 ME_Najd_Events.4.d: "Despite our small size and relative irrelevancy, we are a weak, yet ambitious state! With our rulers set on establishing a new dynasty and power, it is certain that we can achieve success, if we play our cards right, that is. That though, remains to be seen, as the future is unveiled with each passing day, month or year. Bring the fire! For the flames of war yearn for blood of our enemies."
 ME_Najd_Events.4.a: "Kindle the flames of war!"
 
 ME_Najd_Events.5.t: "Our Position on Wahhabism"
 ME_Najd_Events.5.d: "With the rise of Wahhabism, spearheaded by [From.GetName], our Ulema have demanded we make a public statement, condemning the movement. Previously relatively unknown and irrelevant, the Hanbali Maddhab has garnered popularity thanks to the efforts of the rulers of [From.GetName], who, allied with a preacher, have decided to reform their entire school under the guidance of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. While still relatively on the sidelines, their rise cannot be understated and must be reckoned with. How will [Root.Monarch.GetName] treat those developments?"
 ME_Najd_Events.5.a: "Interesting. We will keep an eye on their career."
 ME_Najd_Events.5.b: "Blasphemous!"
 ME_Najd_Events.5.c: "Let us embrace that new wave!"
 
 ME_Najd_Events.6.t: "New Hires"
 ME_Najd_Events.6.d: "With [Root.Monarch.GetName] decision to embrace the new wave of converts to the Hanbali fiqh, came a flow of Hanbali scholars into [Root.GetName]. Indeed, as Wahhabism gains ground in [Root.GetName], there might soon be a new player in the region. At this rate, Hanbali will no longer be considered to be on the sidelines."
 ME_Najd_Events.6.a: "Let us surround ourself with Hanbali scholars."
