 mamluk_reforms_events.1.d: "On this faithful day, the brave personal guard of [Root.Monarch.GetName] was able to put down an attempt on the Sultan's life as part of a greater coup initiated by the supporters of a rival emir. Though it may be shocking to many, it is not all an uncommon occurence, for the Mamluk Oligarchy is quite powerful.\nIndeed, the Sultan's government is but a house of cards, one careful blow is enough to put an end to the rule.\n\nHowever, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is having none of this, he did not meticulously plan his accession to the throne for years, making powerful allies, to be taken down by yet another coup. In fact, [Root.GetName] is a different mamluk, for he is determined to centralize his rule with the help of his powerful allies."

 mamluk_reforms_events.2.d: "Our mamluk government has surely been a blessing to all the mamluks governing the country all over the years, but also a great inhibitor to the various policies. The thing is, that the accession of a new Sultan is often met with much disagreement and opposition, which leads to a deposition further down the line, many times a few times in the span of years. This can heavily destabilize the country and prevent things from getting done. To change the current status quo, a faction of Mamluk reformers emerged, aiming to create a more unified oligarchy."

It's time to get rid of those corrupt administrators, even if it means years of instability and ages of revolts. It is regrettable that this has to be done in the wake of a revolution and not during time of peace."

 mamluk_reforms_events.5.d: "As was to be expected, the Mamluk Oligarchs chose to collect their retinues and march on the capital as a mean to stop our reforms from occurring. Fools!

 mamluk_reforms_events.6.a: "They will meet their fate at last."

 mamluk_reforms_events.7.d: "Having defeated the bulk of the enemy force and the first wave of our opponents, their leaders have shamefully gone into hiding, while their soldiers have dispersed.
