 ME_Mamluks_Events.3.d: "In the pasts, we were a titan of luxury goods that the world would throw money hand over fist for. As our influence over the Mediterranean waivered, so did our luxury industry. Craftsmen of luxury goods have pursued other interests, and we have reverted to an agriculturally dominant economy.

 ME_Mamluks_Events.10.t: "Mamluks Request our Vassalage"
 ME_Mamluks_Events.10.d: "The Mamluk sultan in Qahirah has requested us to swear vassalage to their sultanate. Seeing as they control most of the wealthiest lands in the region, including Syria, the Egyptian farmlands, and the other Turkish beyliks, we would be hard pressed to refuse them.

With their victories over the Christian world in Varna and Constantinople, they have solidified their rule over the Balkans, and are now shifting their interests to Anatolia and the east. Considering our many holdings in the region, our historical rivalry during Turkish Bahri rule, and their evidently ramping war machine lead by Janissary generals, the Ottoman Turks will have no qualms in launching an invasion. We must prepare for a long and arduous confrontation!"

As the Sultanate is much like an oligarchy, the Mamluks themselves wield an uneasy amount of power, and often use this power to intimidate others into accepting unfavourable trades, corrupt deals and much more. It is even more dangerous when the Mamluks unite against what they perceive to be a weak monarch. Evidently, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been determined to be one of these weak monarchs and to be easily manipulated. They have risen up as one and have called for him to accept their demands."

 # ME_Mamluks_Events.23.b: "Confirm their privileges."
 
 ME_Mamluks_Events.24.t: "Mamluks as Muhtasibs"
 ME_Mamluks_Events.24.d: "The explosive growth of the cities [358.GetName] and [361.GetName] has meant that the markets of both cities has grown enormously from the humble roots it once has. Vast trade goods from all over the world are sold to merchants and peasants alike, meaning the quality of these markets directly affects our reputation. To ensure no suspicious activity, faulty goods and maintain general peace in the markets, the appointment of Muhtasibs are required. Seeing as we owe favours to the Mamluks of the Sultanate, it would be a simple affair to appoint them as such. However, we need to ensure they do not attain power over every facet of the state."
 ME_Mamluks_Events.24.a: "Sell the posts to the Mamluks."
 ME_Mamluks_Events.24.b: "Ridiculous proposal! We cannot let the Emirs gain any more power."
 
 ME_Mamluks_Events.25.t: "Well-Guided Secret"
 ME_Mamluks_Events.25.d: "It was once the Yemeni people that maintained the secret of coffee. Now, one way or another, we control the rich valleys of coffee plantations to the point we have attained a monopoly. It is our turn to maintain the secret, and ensure it stays within our borders." 
 ME_Mamluks_Events.25.a: "That is fantastic."
 
 ME_Mamluks_Events.27.t: "The Fall of the Mamluks"
 ME_Mamluks_Events.27.d: "For centuries, the corrupt Mamluk state has festered the land and feasted on the poor people of Egypt and the Levant; Mamluks siphoning resources meant to develop towns into their own wealth, resulting in the stagnation of culture and the economy. With their administration finally falling to outside hands, a new start can be made for the region, free from this oligarchal past."
 ME_Mamluks_Events.27.a: "Alright."
 
 ME_Mamluks_Events.29.t: "Coptic Minority Forms"
 ME_Mamluks_Events.29.d: "Our holdings in Nubia and Abyssinia have always been of coptic majority, and many of their people travel up the African continent, along the Nile into our Egyptian heartland, especially in [Mam_29_coptic_minority_prov.GetName]. For one reason or another, many have decided to settle, be it more fertile and temperate lands, or generally seeking better opportunities. Regardless, the Coptic following in [Mam_29_coptic_minority_prov.GetName] has recently exploded in number."
 ME_Mamluks_Events.29.a: "Nice."
 ME_Mamluks_Events.29.b: "By this point it's a majority."
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.1.t: "Attempted Coup"
 mamluk_reforms_events.1.d: "On this faithful day, the brave personal guard of [Root.Monarch.GetName] was able to put down an attempt on the Sultan's life as part of a greater coup initiated by the supporters of a rival emir. Though it may be shocking to many, it is not all an uncommon occurence, for the Mamluk Oligarchy is quite powerful.\nIndeed, the Sultan's government is but a house of cards, and one careful blow is enough to put an end to the rule.\n\nHowever, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is having none of this, as he did not meticulously plan his ascension to the throne for years, making powerful allies, just to be taken down by yet another coup. In fact, [Root.GetName] is a different mamluk, for he is determined to centralize his rule with the help of his powerful allies."
 mamluk_reforms_events.1.a: "The Reformists and the Oligarchs shall face on the battlefield!"
 mamluk_reforms_events.1.b: "We must delay this as much as we can."
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.2.t: "A Faction of Reformers Emerges"
 mamluk_reforms_events.2.d: "Our Mamluk government has surely been a blessing to all the mamluks governing the country all over the years, but also a great inhibitor to the various policies. Seeing as the ascension of a new Sultan is often met with much disagreement and opposition, it evnetuallys leads to deposition further down the line; and this has occured many times in the span of few years. This readily destabilizes the country to the point of crippling the nation and prevent anything from getting done. To change the current status quo, a faction of mamluk reformers have emerged, aiming to create a more unified and efficient administration, even while maintaining their own power."
 mamluk_reforms_events.2.a: "Support the Reformists."
 mamluk_reforms_events.2.b: "Support the Mamluk Oligarchs"
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.3.t: "Weeds in the Garden"
 mamluk_reforms_events.3.d: "Many of the Mamluk Oligarchs are corrupt and rotten to the core, which severely jeopardises our goals of reforming this wretched country. It is time we get rid of those corrupt administrators, even if it means years of instability and ages of revolts. We must persevere now and suffer a term of pain to earn a lifetime of strength. It is regrettable that this has had to be done in the wake of a revolution and not during time of peace."
 mamluk_reforms_events.3.a: "We will root them out."
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.4.t: "The Opposition Flees"
 mamluk_reforms_events.4.d: "As a response to our crackdown, many of our greatest opponents have fled to our subject lands in order to incite revolt and defiance of our orders. We had already sent the local governors demands of extradition, but time will tell if they will dare defy our will. Heads will roll..."
 mamluk_reforms_events.4.a: "They shall be hanged in [Root.Capital.GetName]!"
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.5.t: "Oppositionists in [Root.Capital.GetName]!"
 mamluk_reforms_events.5.d: "As to be expected, the Mamluk Oligarchs have chosen to collect their retinues and march on the capital as a mean to stop our reforms from occurring. Fools! Their demise will only help cleanse this country of this rot. Their delusions will be purged from the likes of this world!"
 mamluk_reforms_events.5.a: "They will be crushed!"
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.6.t: "Oppositionist Across the Country"
 mamluk_reforms_events.6.d: "Many of our internal opponents have decided to opt to revolt in smaller cities of the realm, expecting less resistance and more time to gather their forces together. Let's see if their accursed faces will be able to attract any help beyond pity of their wives."
 mamluk_reforms_events.6.a: "They will meet their fate at last."
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.7.t: "The Oppositionists Retreat!"
 mamluk_reforms_events.7.d: "Having defeated the bulk of the enemy force and the first wave of our opponents, their leaders have shamefully retreated into hiding, while their soldiers have routed and dispersed in every direction. What is certain though, is that they will return and once again attempt to resist our changes. Somehow, it is doubtful that they will succeed."
 mamluk_reforms_events.7.a: "They will be back..."
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.8.t: "The Second Wave"
 mamluk_reforms_events.8.d: "We have foreseen this second wave of oligarch revolters for many months. They have consolidated their forces into one remaining army; but that will not help them. Their consolidation only means that they will all be crushed at the same time... " 
 mamluk_reforms_events.8.a: "Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!"
 
 mamluk_reforms_events.9.t: "The End of the Mamluk Civil War"
 mamluk_reforms_events.9.d: "With the crushing defeat of the mamluk revolts led by the former oligarchs of the state, the country is no longer suffering from crippling inner turmoil. Stability now returns to the state, and we can look to a better future, free from the shackles of greed and self-interest."
 mamluk_reforms_events.9.a: "The New Era is upon us."
