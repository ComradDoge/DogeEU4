 HKC_ideas_start: "Hokucho Traditions"
 HKC_ideas_bonus: "Hokucho Ambition"
 empowered_bakufu_of_japan: "Empower the Shogun"
 empowered_bakufu_of_japan_desc: "Japanese people only truly prosper under strict military guidance and authority. The shogun knows just how to help enforce this and will indeed do so with the emperor tucked away in a nice palace where people can think he is nothing more than a nice leading figure. The shogun's guidance must indeed lead to rightful conquest for the Japanese people."
 disempowered_emperor_of_japan: "Disempower the Emperor"
 disempowered_emperor_of_japan_desc: "With the emperor out of the way and having little actual legislative or military power throughout our land and all of Japan itself, there will be little in the way of us cultivating a strong military that strives for upholding the peace and prosperity of our land, the lands of the Northern Court."
 proper_vassal_ties: "Proper Subject Ties"
 proper_vassal_ties_desc: "The matter of how we deal with our subjects, both ones that pay regular tributes and ones that do not, is going to be something that comes up routinely in the politics of Hokucho. Let us tend to these matters with diligence and discipline so as to obtain the most out of our subject states, for that is the only way we will be able to ensure a strong and stable diplomatic sector."
 emphasis_on_military_skill: "Emphasis on Martial Prowess"
 emphasis_on_military_skill_desc: "The shogunate embodiers martial prowess emphasized over other matters, and though at times the administration itself is quite decentralized there is a staunch focus on military quality when ascending upwards in rank and title. As time goes on, our officers and commanders will be seasoned in military strategy and tactics so that the troops they command are led properly and without worry from the shogun."
 disciplined_samurai_class: "The Discipline of the Samurai"
 disciplined_samurai_class_desc: "Though at times the samurai of our Hokucho can be unruly, there is little doubt that they have great military potential. If we can tame them and integrate them into Hokucho ranks throughout the coming decades, there will be few that will be able to compete with our soldiers and the discipline they possess."
 solve_administrative_conflicts: "Conflicts of Interest"
 solve_administrative_conflicts_desc: "Inside the administration of the Northern Court, politics can often get messy between various advisors and officials, especially when it comes to various family ties and land grants. The shogun and those around him should ideally work toward a stable system of politics that can regularly appoint people to positions of prominence without worry of backlash from others since doing so will certainly create a good deal of legitimacy amongst the people."
 undo_rival_lord_power: "A Sword to Petty Rivals"
 undo_rival_lord_power_desc: "And within the lands of the Hokucho, shugo lords and certain daimyo who think they can oppose the will of the shogun will be handed their own head separated from their body. There will be no tolerance for unruly governors and such and we will ensure that loyal soldiers will cut down all who stand in the way of the progress of Hokucho."
 NNC_ideas: "Nancho Ideas"
 NNC_ideas_start: "Nancho Traditions"
 NNC_ideas_bonus: "Nancho Ambition"
 the_three_japanese_regalia: "The Three Sacred Treasures"
 the_three_japanese_regalia_desc: "Kusanagi no Tsurugi representing valor, Yata no Kagami representing wisdom, and Yasakani no Magatama representing benevolence; these are the three sacred treasure of Japan. Brought to our land by Ninigi-no-Mikoto, the legendary ancestor of the Imperial House of Japan, the Southern Court is the one that holds these grand relics. Those of the Northern Court or any other possible court in Japan are mere pretenders to the title of emperor and the power it wields and with these relics, we will make it known."
 restoration_of_true_imperial_power: "Restore True Imperial Power"
 restoration_of_true_imperial_power_desc: "With daimyo being scattered across Japan and a civilian administration not being present in the slightest, the people seeing the emperor in Nancho as both legitimate and taking the reins of command emboldens them in the face of adversity. No longer is it a military authority that is trying to lead the Japanese people, but rather it is the emperor himself and those loyal to him and the traditions of old. Let these traditions guide us into the future and strengthen the heart and soul of our military."
 reinstate_offices_of_civil_governors: "Reinstate Civil Governors"
 reinstate_offices_of_civil_governors_desc: "During the Nanboku-cho Jidai of 1336 to 1392, the office of 'civil governor' was gradually taken over by shugo lords all across Japan. They were in essence both governors with legitimate duties to uphold and feudal lords that vied for power amongst other feudal lords, causing both tension and decentralization throughout the land. If we can dismantle the system that brought the shugo lords to power and reinstate the offices of civil governors, we can ease the administrative burden on the Southern Court."
 disempower_the_shugo_lords: "Disempower the Shugo Lords"
 disempower_the_shugo_lords_desc: "Once we are done disempowering the shugo lords that once held a great deal of power over the lands of Japan, we can focus on bringing up the diplomatic posture of Japan to outside powers and people. Formalizing diplomatic relations and also ensuring that our land is free from foreign intrigue will go a long way in ensuring the prosperity of Nancho."
 endurace_of_the_southern_court: "Endurance of Nancho"
 endurace_of_the_southern_court_desc: "Though the Northern Court was slowed by a number of administrative difficulties during the Nanboku-cho Jidai, they still retained great military power and used it against the Southern Court, grinding it down into dust eventually. But, the Southern Court did not simply yield to these efforts from the north in one single battle, no, they endured for decades knowing that they were the rightful rulers of Japan. It is this enduring spirit that we must cultivate once more in our people."
 expand_and_reform_the_kanrei: "Expand and Reform the Kanrei"
 expand_and_reform_the_kanrei_desc: "The kanrei has been a sort of deputy to the shogun and has served as one to help in administrative functions throughout the shogunate in the past; Ashikaga Yoshiakira (son of Ashikaga Takauji) had Hosokawa Yoriyuki as his kanrei and was successful in a a variety of political matters concerning shugo lords. If we can emulate this position of deputy for the emperor and expand the position with perhaps multiple deputies, there could be a great deal of legislation that becomes easier to discuss and push through."
 sole_legitimacy_over_japan: "The Only Keeper of Japan"
 sole_legitimacy_over_japan_desc: "The mon of Nancho will be what people gather to support the rightful emperor. Whether they be clans like the Kitabatake, the Tsutsui, the Date, or any others, they will know that there is one sole protector and leader of Japan and that is the emperor of the Nancho, the Southern Court. May the names of the Northern Court pretenders forever be tainted with illegitimacy."
 KNM_ideas: "Kenmu Ideas"
 KNM_ideas_start: "Kenmu Traditions"
 KNM_ideas_bonus: "Kenmu Ambition"
 spearhead_of_the_emperor: "The Emperor as our Leader"
 spearhead_of_the_emperor_desc: "The concept of the 'Kenmu Restoration' was spearheaded by Emperor Go-Daigo amidst the collapsing authority of the Kamakura Shogunate in the early 1330s. His ambition to retake authority away from the shogun and to bring back the power of the emperor is something to look up to as it is a shining example of what our lands could have been like without harsh military leadership."
 properly_deal_with_the_samurai_class: "To Deal with the Samurai Class"
 properly_deal_with_the_samurai_class_desc: "The class of unruly and powerful samurai in Japanese society has been a consistent factor in determining which daimyo thrives or dies, which shogun rises to power or dies mysteriously, and what laws get enforced on the local level in various provinces. We cannot let this continue and we must find a way to satisfy the samurai via proper military centralization and a thoroughly thought out army organization."
 land_owndership_questions: "How to Deal with Land Ownership"
 land_owndership_questions_desc: "Land ownership is also a tricky matter we must deal with if we are to be a true successor to the older Kenmu Restoration. Back then it was poorly handled thanks to Emperor Go-Daigo's various allies and supporters being people he didn't want to take land from, but we are stronger now administratively and can properly push through legislation that will refine the laws on land ownership without causing a breakdown in society."
 go_daigos_failure_with_civilians: "Emperor Go-Daigo's Civilian Failures"
 go_daigos_failure_with_civilians_desc: "A key failure in Emperor Go-Daigo's methods was not fulfilling his ambition to bring back the control of lands to civilians which angered quite a few people. If we can sort through the old laws on the books and build upon our earlier work that focused on land ownership, we can properly satisfy our people's need for land reform."
 the_military_class_do_not_rule: "Organize Classes in Society"
 the_military_class_do_not_rule_desc: "All too often we see the military class come forth to try to take control of the administration and away from the emperor. Indeed this is how the Ashikaga Shogunate came to power since its founder, Ashikaga Takauji, believed that the military class had the right to rule which flew in the face of Emperor Go-Daigo. We of Kenmu will not let this happen again and we will instead ensure that the military is kept under a tight and disciplined leash."
 go_daigos_corruption_failures: "Emperor Go-Daigo's Corruption"
 go_daigos_corruption_failures_desc: "Another facet of the Kenmu Restoration under Emperor Go-Daigo was the corruption and inexperience inherent within the tribunal system he set up. We should strive for a new tribunal and court system like Emperor Go-Daigo wanted, but place a much greater emphasis on education for the various positions needed and also work to make sure that corrupt ties do not seep into the system."
 put_the_governors_back_into_place: "Reinstate the Emperor's Authority"
 put_the_governors_back_into_place_desc: "The time for military governments is now over; the time for civilian governments is now. The emperor may not seem much different from the shogun, but in reality he rules with a comparatively lighter hold on the land and is not keen on a decentralized system of authority that places faith in military governors backed by unruly samurai. In time, the emperor's authority will become a welcome presence in all domains that the Japanese rule over."
 LML_ideas: "Lombard League Ideas"
 LML_ideas_start: "Lombard League Traditions"
 LML_ideas_bonus: "Lombard League Ambition"
 in_defense_of_the_peninsula: "In Defense of the Peninsula"
 in_defense_of_the_peninsula_desc: "The Italian Peninsula is rife with disruptions what with the Pope wanting power and various minor dukes and officials wanting power as well, but if there is one thing we are unified in, it is in defending the peninsula from foreign influence and aggression, especially when it comes the north. The Lombard League will stand tall and ready to defend the northern part of the peninsula once more!"
 papal_sanctioned_protection: "Sanctioned Defense"
 papal_sanctioned_protection_desc: "The Pope sanctioned our defense of the Italian Peninsula from the Holy Roman Empire's Frederick I and Frederick II, thus giving our military more justification and legitimacy when they took to the various walled cities to defend against invading armies of the Holy Roman Empire. The defense of the peninsula will of course be sanctioned once more should it be necessary, and even if the Pope cannot sanction us right at the time we need it, a cardinal or bishop will do just as well."
 cities_opposed_to_the_hre: "Opposition to the Holy Roman Empire"
 cities_opposed_to_the_hre_desc: "Those inside the Holy Roman Empire who stand against expanding influence of the emperor are mostly of Italian descent since our identity and culture is far different from places such as Bavaria, Saxony, and Verden. Though it will be tough to properly coordinate politics and military affairs amongst the various Italian cities of the north, we can be sure that if we succeed in coordinating a unified strategy for our combined military forces, there will be none who can break the Lombard League."
 beyond_driot_de_regale: "Beyond the Driot de Regale"
 beyond_driot_de_regale_desc: "The Peace of Constance in 1183 established a compromise between Italian cities and the emperor of Holy Roman Empire wherein, the cities would retain a level of autonomy (driot de regale) in exchange for loyalty to the emperor. This agreement is long forgotten by many people in the heart of the Holy Roman Empire, but Italian cities remember it dearly. There will be more than just autonomy for the Italian cities, there will be independence with Italians governing themselves!"
 turn_over_any_imperial_ban: "An Imperial Ban is Nothing"
 turn_over_any_imperial_ban_desc: "When Emperor Frederick II tried to gain more power in the peninsula, he issued an Imperial Ban on the Lombard League wand waged war against it back then. This is seen by us as a badge of honor instead of a mark of shame as we fought back bravely against the armies of the Holy Roman Empire and won at the Siege of Parma in 1248! Let others who oppose the central power of the Holy Roman Empire join our effort to dismantle it!"
 reform_the_universitas: "Reform the Universitas"
 reform_the_universitas_desc: "The 'universitas' of the old Lombard League was a council that consisted of representatives appointed by individual municipalities; it voted via a majority on various matters like new members being admitted and whether to wage continued war or strive for peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Reforming this representative part of our government will help keep the spirit of republican ideals alive and well."
 customs_union_and_trade_privleges: "Refine the Customs Union"
 customs_union_and_trade_privleges_desc: "Whilst the Lombard League has traditionally been a decentralized confederation of sorts overall, the past iterations of it saw the creation of a customs union that handled matters of trade much more effectively than smaller trade guilds used to. If we can build upon that foundation of a customs union and refine it as time goes on with better business practices, the Lombard League may indeed be more profitable when united like this."
 SMA_ideas: "Somali Ideas"
 SMA_ideas_start: "Somali Traditions"
 SMA_ideas_bonus: "Somali Ambition"
 united_somali_communites: "United Somali Communities"
 united_somali_communites_desc: "The various Somali communities and towns that are spread across the Horn of Africa have been fractured in the past, swearing loyalty to different leaders so that one day they would see unification. It was a turbulent path to unity but out of the fires of war and through firm diplomacy, Somali people can finally say with confidence that they are united behind one flag and one state, ready to defend it no matter the cost."
 dominant_merchant_fleets: "Fleets of Somalia"
 dominant_merchant_fleets_desc: "Somali people have made their living off of trade for centuries thanks to the great coastal cities that provide safe places for merchant vessels. Guarding these waters against attacking raiders and such is also part of what earns Somali people prosperity and a good reputation, and it is because of this protective attitude toward our coasts and trade routes that we have amassed such a magnificent fleet."
 hegemony_over_ports: "Harbors of Somali Strength"
 hegemony_over_ports_desc: "Improving and building up our habors and docks is a natural part of promoting trade growth. From setting up new docking areas to building new structures for merchants to do business in, each one of our coastal cities and harbors is key in attracting merchants from everywhere we can think of."
 formal_clan_duties: "Formal Clan Duties"
 formal_clan_duties_desc: "The various clans of Somalia are diverse in their origins and they pose a possible threat to our power if they become dissatisfied with our authority. By structuring the government of Somalia in such a way that it gives each formal clan a workable position in Somalia, we can lessen the threat they pose and increase the amount of resources they give to us, the most important one being men capable of fighting."
 somali_honor_guards: "Somali Honor Guards"
 somali_honor_guards_desc: "We have been the victims of our own ambition, in a sense. We desire wealth and prosperity through trade, thus we lacked the ambition to formulate a proper military on land that could at least defend Somali communities effectively. It is now that we will turn this around and begin instituting strong reforms to the Somali soldiers aimed at instilling discipline in them. It will take a long time to achieve our goals for our military, but laying a solid foundation here and now will go a long way in Somalia's future."
 command_east_africa: "Command of East Africa"
 command_east_africa_desc: "Our ambitions in East Africa are known all across our administration and as we continue to project our power over the great cities of wealth that line the coast of East Africa, we will only see our revenue rise higher and higher. Few can contest the amount of wealth made in cities such as Zanzibar and Mombasa as it is, now imagine how much more wealth they would bring in if we controlled them."
 somali_ocean: "The Somali Ocean"
 somali_ocean_desc: "The vast ocean to our east, it is rife with opportunity if we can claim it for ourselves, but we will not be the only ones sending ships out there to claim trade routes and mercantile chances. Our ships and sailors need to be ever present and ever vigilant of what threats there are to our extensive trading in the ocean, and when intruders try to break into the Somali Ocean despite our hegemony, we will gladly send them to the dark depths of the ocean."
 FJI_ideas: "Fujiwara Ideas"
 FJI_ideas_start: "Fujiwara Traditions"
 FJI_ideas_bonus: "Fujiwara Ambition"
 foremost_clan_closest_to_power: "Fujiwara Soft Dominance"
 foremost_clan_closest_to_power_desc: "From about the 900s to about the 1100s, the Fujiwara Clan was at its peak with soft power being extended all around Japanese land thanks to familial connections to the emperor. It is time that the Fujiwara Clan is known once more in every part of Japan instead of these petty clans that split off from our old rivals so long ago. Our sons and daughters will find good company in various families of prominence and we will find ourselves with an immense amount of power in time."
 the_sessho_and_kampaku_positions: "Positions as Sessho and Kampaku"
 the_sessho_and_kampaku_positions_desc: "Sessho is a title traditionally given to the regent of a child emperor; kampaku is traditionally something of a chief advisor, first secretary, and regent who assists the adult emperor. It was during the Heian Period some centuries ago that the Fujiwara Clan held these two positions with relative ease and without worry (a cadet branch named Hokke was able to establish a hereditary claim to the position of regent as a whole). It is time that these two positions come back to being firmly under the Fujiwara Clan as a whole."
 strong_links_via_soft_power: "Utilize Familial Connections"
 strong_links_via_soft_power_desc: "Perhaps our most prominent familial ancestor was Fujiwara no Michinaga (966-1027). Grandfather of three emperors, father of six empresses, and the grandfather of seven other imperial consorts, it is by no means an exaggeration to say that he symbolized the apex of Fujiwara power and influence. We will strive to do similarly to Fujiwara no Michinaga and establish dynastic ties and links with foreign families to ensure that our soft power spreads even further, possibly beyond the lands of Japan itself."
 uphold_strict_family_governance: "Strict Family Governance"
 uphold_strict_family_governance_desc: "During the height of the Fujiwara Clan's power, several lesser members were court nobles, provincial governors, members of the provincial aristocracy, and even some were known as samurai. By emphasizing strict family governance and promoting better education efforts for the Fujiwara Clan as a whole, we can ensure a much stronger administration that can keep our lands stable no matter what happens."
 to_become_the_puppet_master: "Becoming the Puppet Master"
 to_become_the_puppet_master_desc: "Slowly but surely, Fujiwara influence is seeping into every part of Japanese society. Those clans that might still hold out against our resurgence will not hold out for much longer as our network of nobles and warriors will surely catch them out sooner or later. When all is said and done, there will be only the Fujiwara Clan left to be the military and administrative puppet master of the entirety of Japan."
 a_new_period_of_cultural_flourishing: "Renewed Cultural Flourishing"
 a_new_period_of_cultural_flourishing_desc: "Whilst our administration is handling the likes of provincial matters and passing laws to ensure that our power is felt all across the land, many members of the Fujiwara Clan are seeking a renewed period of cultural insight through the likes of poetry and plays. Though this path may seem useless and not worth the effort to various samurai leaders, we recognize that we have the power to establish a new golden age of Japanese culture if we simply empower our people to strive for it."
 steady_enforcement_of_fujiwara_power: "All under the Fujiwara Clan"
 steady_enforcement_of_fujiwara_power_desc: "Though our influence declined beyond the 1100s due to the Taira Clan and the Minamoto Clan fighting for power in Heian-kyo, they remained dominant in terms of being close advisors the emperors. Now that there is one grand clan that is uniting all of Japan under its authority, few will be able to oppose the soft power we project through our family members and also the hard power we have in the form of a strong military sector."
 TAA_ideas: "Taira Ideas"
 TAA_ideas_start: "Taira Traditions"
 TAA_ideas_bonus: "Taira Ambition"
 the_kanmu_heishi_lineage: "The Kanmu Heishi Lineage"
 the_kanmu_heishi_lineage_desc: "Some grandchildren of Emperor Kanmu (736-806) were the first to actually take on the name 'Taira' after 825. Though other descendants of Emperor Nimmyo, Montoku, and Koko took on the name 'Taira', it was the ones descended from Emperor Kanmu that became the most prominent in Japan. Those of the Kanmu Heishi lineage, founded in 889 by Taira no Takamochi, became some of the most influential people during the Heian Period. Though times have changed since the days of the Heian Period, the Kanmu Heishi lines of descent are still very much around and we will utilize them as much as we can."
 taira_no_kiyomori_samurai_lineage: "Taira no Kiyomori's Samurai"
 taira_no_kiyomori_samurai_lineage_desc: "Learning from what Taira no Kiyomori did with those under his command will help us better organize the Taira military sector since Taira no Kiyomori organized one of the first samurai government structures in all of Japan. If we can compound on this and refine the structure as time goes on, officers and commanders of our military will be in a much better position whenever war comes to our clan."
 the_hogen_and_heiji_rebellions: "The Hogen and Heiji Disturbances"
 the_hogen_and_heiji_rebellions_desc: "The Hogen and Heiji Disturbances were relatively short civil wars that resulted in a variety of politics shifting in Japan for the time, but the most prominent shift was the Fujiwara Clan falling from power and us, the Taira Clan, becoming stronger than ever before. We remember this time fondly and live for the day when we can restore our power to this point, but we must contend with the fact that it may be a while before we hold most of Japan under our authority."
 rein_in_the_kanmu_heishi_lines: "Rein in the Branching Clans"
 rein_in_the_kanmu_heishi_lines_desc: "The various clans that branched off of the Kanmu Heishi lineage became various local governors and daimyo as time went on. Those of the Chiba, Miura, and original Hatakeyama Clan are just some of the most prominent branches of the lineage and they will need to be reined sooner rather than later so that the Taira Clan itself has no true opposition to its power. If we cannot rein them in via diplomatic means, then we will fight them in the field of battle."
 learn_from_loss_in_the_genpei: "Losses in the Genpei War"
 learn_from_loss_in_the_genpei_desc: "The Genpei War was more or less the end of Taira power since Minamoto no Yoritomo's rebellion culminated in the Kamakura Shogunate. If we are to restore our old power and retain it through the fires and rebellion, then we must build up our military tactics and strategy to the point that we can counter any internal threats we may face."
 defeat_minamoto_power: "Defeat the Minamoto Descendants"
 defeat_minamoto_power_desc: "Though the Kamakura Shogunate ended after the Kenmu Restoration, the various branching dynasties of the Minamoto Clan are still a viable threat to the power of the Taira Clan. Building up a large enough military to combat them will be key since in this age of ever evolving diplomacy and military technology, they could bring to light things we have not yet faced. No matter what it takes, we must crush any lingering source of Minamoto power."
 restoration_of_proper_power: "Revived and Refined"
 restoration_of_proper_power_desc: "With our resurgence close to being fully realized and few others standing in our way, there are few who can doubt the legitimacy of our administration and its leadership. The Fujiwara Clan is out of politics for good, Minamoto Clan is thoroughly swept out of any scene we care for, and the Tachibana Clan has been gone for centuries now. Let us usher in a new age of grandeur for the Japanese people, and let the Taira Clan bring a new age of prosperity upon a united Japan."

 the_21_genji_lines: "The 21 Genji Branches"
 the_21_genji_lines_desc: "The various branchs of the Minamoto Clan are descended from various emperors from the past. Though some branches are no longer around, many still are and hold a considerable amount of power around Japan, power that we will need to take for ourselves if we wish to succeed in the future. Once all the branches are reined in, we will have an a vast amount of manpower to draw from for future conflicts."
 guardians_of_heian_kyo: "Guarding Heian-kyo"
 guardians_of_heian_kyo_desc: "When the Fujiwara Clan was in power, they often called upon Minamoto Clan members to restore order in Heian-kyo when things broke down into violent clashes. This legacy of guarding the imperial capital is what instills discipline into the heart of many Minamoto soldiers and leaders and we will continue the tradition long into the future. The greatest of our soldiers will know honor and grandeur in the imperial capital, but they will never drop in their disciplinary missions or measures."
 destruction_of_the_taira_clan: "Destruction of the Taira Clan"
 destruction_of_the_taira_clan_desc: "The rule of the Taira Clan was brief by some accounts, but it was a long and arduous period for the Minamoto Clan. It was only by Minamoto no Yoritomo's efforts in starting the Genpei War that we came to ultimate power, founding the Kamakura Shogunate shortly after and bringing a great amount of prestige and honor to our clan. Let this destruction of the Taira Clan be a memory that all in the Minamoto Clan cherish, for it was the time when we saw our grand rise to power."
 legacy_of_the_first_bakufu: "Legacy of the Kamakura Shogunate"
 legacy_of_the_first_bakufu_desc: "The Kamakura Shogunate was where we held immense amounts of power throughout Japan, but it was not complete as there were those who tried to oppose our authority and decentralize the administration. If we can reinstate our authority with a new shogunate and cultivate a much stronger central administration, there will be none who can escape our grasp and enforce their own local edicts."
 restoration_of_minamoto_power: "Restore Minamoto Power"
 restoration_of_minamoto_power_desc: "To properly restore Minamoto power, land will need to be annexed, local lords will need to be culled, and strict adherence to our laws must the norm. The largest hurdle for us will be the annexation of land though, since there are many in Japan and even outside of Japan who would oppose the grand unification that we dream of."
 revoke_the_power_of_shikken: "Revoke the Power of the Shikken"
 revoke_the_power_of_shikken_desc: "During the time of the Kamakura Shogunate, the shikken was a titular post traditionally held by a member of the Hojo Clan. They were supposed to be a regent for us until the young leader-to-be was ready to take hold of command, but throughout political moves and various ties to family members, the Hojo Clan was able to maintain ultimate authority in the administration whilst the shogun was reduced in power. We will learn from this and ensure that no shikken is ever able to use the Minamoto Clan in such a way like a puppet master would."
 the_one_true_leader_of_japan: "Ascend Feudal Politics"
 the_one_true_leader_of_japan_desc: "From the grounds of feudal politics, the Minamoto Clan has found both great power and solid foundation for its rise to power. Through the discipline of our military and through the military-oriented administration of the shogunate, we will cultivate a new future for our people that is brighter than ever before! The Minamoto Clan will know no boundaries and its blades will cut through any enemy that stands in the way!"

 lvn_symbol_of_italian_unification_desc: "Shattered into feuding duchies and republics that want power, wealth, and prestige, the lands of the Italian Peninsula are rife with warfare and tension that others have exploited for centuries. With the unification of Lombards and Venetians though, there is something that can finally begin to fully unite the people of Italy together into one cohesive state that is governed by Italians, for Italians. Let those pesky French, Spanish, and German monarchs be cast away as we make our grand rise to power!"
 lvn_land_and_sea_arsenal: "Lombard Armories; Venetian Arsenals"
 lvn_land_and_sea_arsenal_desc: "Whether by sea or by land, we will always be ready for battle. Foundations in Milan and Venice mean that we are capable of fielding proper troops and ships in an organized fashion that is comparable to the likes of other large states; the only thing limiting us in this regard is how much we can really afford. Disciplined troops and strudy ships are not cheap, but we know for a fact that Lombardy-Venetia can produce both without failure."
 lvn_honest_representation_of_italians: "Represent the Italian People"
 lvn_honest_representation_of_italians_desc: "Monarchy? Republic? Both are options for Lombardy-Venetia, but what is not an optional is representing the various Italian people in our domain. They have suffered for too long at the hands of outside influences trying to extract wealth and prestige from them whilst being too weak to ever truly fight back. We will turn this around and give proper representation in the government to Lombards, Venetians, Ligurians, Neapolitans, Umbrians, and all others who can truly call themselves, 'Italian'."
 mlo_epitome_of_the_renaissance: "The Peak of the Renaissance"
 mlo_epitome_of_the_renaissance_desc: "Though we can't really define when the Renaissance started and ended, we can define the period of heightened cultural and scholarly output of the Italian Peninsula! Milan, Mantua, Venice, and several other cities thrived during this time and we will continue this emphasis on being where thinkers, musicians, poets, and artists flock to so that their work is spread far and wide."
 mlo_a_permanent_military_force: "From Mercenary Times Onwards"
 mlo_a_permanent_military_force_desc: "Condottieri have come and gone in the Italian Peninsula, but their legacy lives on in our military today. Several officers and commanders in Lombardy-Venetia are descendants of previous condottieri which means we do have a bit of mercenary blood in our ranks, but in order to prevail in the future, we will need to build a standing army. Slowly but surely, we will enacy steady reforms aimed at lessening our reliance on mercenary contracts and increasing our actual military potential."
 mlo_enlightened_rulership: "Enlightened Principles"
 mlo_enlightened_rulership_desc: "It is not enough to be held to the standards of French, Spanish, or German traditions of how leaders should rule; they rule with iron fists and edicts stemming from the heavens through the clergy, but we see the need for more concrete and rational principles in governance. We must rule for the benefit of not only wealthy merchants and nobles, but also for the good of our own people, and we also need to work on creating solidarity and trust between our commoners and our bureaucrats."

 mlo_rally_lombards_and_venetians_desc: "When the time comes for war against German soldiers, French cavalry, or Spanish ships, people will rally to the cause of Lombardy-Venetia. The noble flame carried forth by our grand union between Lombards and Venetians will not be put so easily by pompous kings and emperors from afar. The people of the Italian Peninsula know what they fight for is right and just, and the fight will burn into the dead of night should it need to."
 ven_influences_beyond_adriatic: "The Reach of the Venetians"
 ven_influences_beyond_adriatic_desc: "If it was not for the Republic of Venice and its great reach beyond the shores of the Italian Peninsula, would there be any power that thought of the Italians as viable threats? Most likely not! And it is because of this great reach that the Venetians cultivated that we are so connected throughout the Mediterranean Sea and beyond. In time, we are going to make more friends and allies who can aid Lombardy-Venetia in its endeavors and perhaps we can strike a trade deal or two with them."
 ven_trade_monopolies: "Mediterranean Trade Monopolies"
 ven_trade_monopolies_desc: "Securing trade monopolies is not an easy thing to do, but if anyone can do it, it is the people of Lombardy-Venetia. The mercantile skills of the Venetians combined with the martial prowess of the Lombards can easily net us a strong position if we need to make a violent entrance into a market, but even if we don't, the expertise of our merchants will slowly increase our trade power in all markets around Lombardy-Venetia."
 ven_naval_bases: "Expand our Arsenals"
 ven_naval_bases_desc: "To help keep our many trade routes safe, it would be wise for us to build up more arsenals and naval bases at our coastal holdings around the Adriatic and Mediterranean Sea. It will cut down on maintenance and also bolster our naval strength compared to the likes of other rival powers around us."
 ven_protect_what_is_ours: "Protected Assets"
 ven_protect_what_is_ours_desc: "Fending off rival merchants is a bit of risky task as it could easily lead to trade wars if state officials get involved from both sides. Still though, we are dedicated to ensuring that trade flowing into and out of Lombardy-Venetia is safe and secure so that our profit margins are where we want them to be; if we have to fight to secure our profits from foreign smugglers or raiders, then we will absolutely do so!"

 hxa_unite_the_scattered_cities: "Unite the Scattered Cities"
 hxa_unite_the_scattered_cities_desc: "The coasts of our land have scattered cities and villages, just as the mountains and hills do if one travels further inland. For far too long they've been without unity and without central guidance, but that is no more. We will build up these villages into towns, and we will build up infrastructure inside these towns and cities so that they can provide more manpower, taxes, and also produce more crops for our empire."
 hxa_central_religious_unity: "Destroy the Foreign Faiths"
 hxa_central_religious_unity_desc: "Foreigners might think of us having strange traditions that must be taken down, but we are much stronger than before. Our religious officials and devoted people have done much in the way of reforming religious rituals and traditions to the point where we can effectively enforce a unified state religion throughout the land. We will do as such through edicts and laws, and we will eradicate these foreign faiths that seek to erase what traditions have been passed down to us."
 hxa_workings_of_gold_and_jade: "Goldsmiths and Jade Artisans"
 hxa_workings_of_gold_and_jade_desc: "The lands of our people are rife with gold, jade, and other precious materials that many value for their quality and rarity. Because we have so much time to refine how we work these materials in terms of sculptures and artwork, many works we produce are traded across the world for high prices and some merchants even come back to our shores seeking more. It is this kind of mercantile and artisnal work that helps keep Huaxyacac in a position of prominence beyond its own shores."
 hxa_codices_of_our_history: "The Works of our History"
 hxa_codices_of_our_history_desc: "We have tried for centuries to keep track of our past with codices and writing, but our scattered languages and unrefined writing systems have produced more difficulties than possibilities for us. If we concentrate on working out a common writing system and a foramlized set of language for Huaxyacac as a whole, then we can track our history through works of writing and art with great precision and it will also help track the lineage of the royal family."
 zap_religious_heart_of_mitla: "Mitla, the Religious Heart"
 zap_religious_heart_of_mitla_desc: "The Zapotec people have had their high priest, the Uija-tao, stationed at Mitla. A place where Mixtec architectural styles mix with Zapotec styles in a beautiful display that is also the gateway between the world of the living and the world of the dead, Mitla is a place uniquely suited to be where our religious power comes from in our capital region. Priests and devoted followers of our faith will surely make regular trips to Mitla and we will recruit faithful followers there without question."
 zap_empire_building_once_again: "To Build Another Empire"
 zap_empire_building_once_again_desc: "Who is friend, and who is foe? The days of the Tlapanec, Mixtec, and most all the Zapotec people stretch back for centuries and in those old days, the Zapotec people cultivated perhaps the largest empire out of the three groups of people. Though it did not stretch far, it was very impactful on the people and they still strive for those days of being a truly dominant power in the region. If we are to build another empire, we must ensure we can have strong allies and small rivals whilst building up our internal domain through governors and advisors."
 zap_beyond_obsidian: "Fashioning New Weapons"
 zap_beyond_obsidian_desc: "The weaponry of our ancestors are no longer capable of winning battles and wars, for the days of obsidian arrows and spears are long gone. Now we must take to gunpowder weapons both large and small, building up a military that can effectively use them in battle against whatever enemy they encounter. We will prioritize our infantry in this matter since our homeland is not suited for masses of cannons or cavalry moving through the thick jungles and steep hills."
 mix_connect_the_city_states: "Roads through Huaxyacac"
 mix_connect_the_city_states_desc: "As we build up the infrastructure of our towns and cities, we will of course need proper roads to go between them all so that communication is much easier for both civilians and military officials. Simple dirt paths won't be enough through the jungles and hills of our region, no, Huaxyacac needs strong roads made of stone so that walking, running, or marching on said road is not a hazard in any sense."
 mix_learn_from_previous_battles: "Cultivating Endurance"
 mix_learn_from_previous_battles_desc: "Centuries of warfare in the jungles and hills of the region have hardened the Mixtec, Tlapanec, and Zapotec people. They know exactly what war brings to the land and to their own communities and they know exactly what precautions must be taken when the horns of war sound off. The struggles now may bring many to the point of death or close to it, but sacrifice right now will lead to success after the war is won."
 mix_refine_tribute_systems: "Taxation & Tribute"
 mix_refine_tribute_systems_desc: "The way taxes and tribute have been conducted and sent throughout the region in centuries past has led to tenuous holds on power since it was unorganized and fairly open to corruption. Now that we of Huaxyacac are fairly keen on centralizing things and reforming our economic potential, ensuring that our system of collecting taxes and tribute is able to function properly is what we need to focus on."
 tla_reformation_of_cotton_armor: "Beyond Cotton Armor"
 tla_reformation_of_cotton_armor_desc: "Cotton armor has been a consistent piece of armor throughout our region as it is light, flexible, easy to gain the ingredients, and can stop a variety of light attacks. Things are changing fast though and cotton armor is no longer capable of standing up to newer weapons. We need to employ new armor with new materials so that our troops can keep themselves safe in the heat of battle, or can at least survive a blow or two from being up close and personal."
 tla_endless_wars: "Endless War"
 tla_endless_wars_desc: "The fact that the Tlapanec, Zapotec, and Mixtec people have faced centuries of warfare not only internally, but also externally too means that the people are no stranger to what it is like to be called up for military service. Our training standards need to be more formalized and with better equipment so that any and all soldiers we enlist are ready when for battle at a quicker rate."
 tla_strong_internal_domain: "Strengthen our Foundations"
 tla_strong_internal_domain_desc: "The foundations of Huaxyacac can seem weak to outsiders and indeed to some officials they are still weak as of today. Reforming the way laws are passed and how local officials handle the enforcement of laws can give us a much stronger foundation since it will allow for us to have confidence that our local communities are providing what they can for the empire as a whole."

 the_two_domains: "The Two Domains"
 the_two_domains_desc: "England and France are both vast in their stretches of land and diverse in the people who fought for both. By uniting them together into one single political entity, we can combine the forces through various integrative efforts and make a unified military for the Angevin Realm itself, one that is proud, brave, and courageous enough to stand against the foes of Europe."
 inter_disciplinary_standards: "Inter-Disciplinary Standards"
 inter_disciplinary_standards_desc: "Across the Channel on both sides, the standards for military service may have been different in some senses, but they were also similar in other regards. By refining both and taking the best from both the English and the French ways of training and disciplining troops, those of the Angevin Realm can benefit from the highest quality training around."
 subjects_of_the_crowns: "Subjects of the Crowns"
 subjects_of_the_crowns_desc: "When Henry II was around to claim a majority of what is considered Angevin, there were several subject feudatories that held the realm together. Though we are more centralized now, we still rely on subject states here and there and as such should be ready to keep these subjects in line and loyal to the unified crown, whether by English or French means."
 english_channel_control: "Channel Control"
 english_channel_control_desc: "The heart of trade for us is quite obvious: the English Channel. It's a haven for trade and very profitable for us, and along with that, it has given us ample opportunity to refine our naval efforts and tactics, as well as giving us a safe gateway to the west and the east. It's our natural duty to ensure that our power propagates out from the English Channel and never fades from it."
 fertility_of_french_land: "Fertility of French Land"
 fertility_of_french_land_desc: "With the extremely fertile lands of France under our control, we can reform the agricultural practices over time and ensure an ample supply of food (as well as other resources) for our people. It might take some time to do, but it will be more than worth it in the end when the military and citizens of the Angevin Realm are well fed and prosperous."
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres: "Interlocked Administrative Cadres"
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres_desc: "With the unification of the crowns comes administrative questions and some are tougher to handle than others, but we are not without the will to overcome these obstacles. Cultivating a unified court between both the English and French will help us achieve this goal of an integrated and well connected administration, one that can manage the vast domains of the Angevin Realm."
 industrialization_measures: "Industrialization Measures"
 industrialization_measures_desc: "A new age is coming about, an age of new technologies and ideas that the people of the Angevin Realm are seeing as both dangerous and full of potential. It may be foolish of us to rush into this new age, but the benefits of its industrial techniques and new technologies are simply too good to pass up. Whatever problems come with entering this new age we will deal with, but industrial matters must become a central part of the Angevin Realm."

 pacify_the_berbers_desc: "Despite the numbers of Moroccans, Tunisians, and Algerians around North Africa, the Berbers are still very powerful and very influential in politics around the various areas we control. We must meet with them on equal terms and accept them as our own so that we do not invoke their ire. Should we turn our backs on the numerous Berber tribes in our borders, we could face a civil war the likes of which few have ever seen before."
 caliphate_status: "Caliphate Ideals"
 caliphate_status_desc: "The Caliphates of the past have stretched across the Maghreb in centuries past, leaving lasting influences on the various people that still remain in the Maghreb. Though some Islamic theologians preach different doctrines and ideals within our borders, we strive for something that nearly all within our borders agree with: the status of a being a caliphate. Like our ancestors of the Almohad and Fatimid Caliphates and our kin from the Rashidun, Corodoba, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates, we will follow in their footsteps and spread the word of the prophet Muhammad to all corners of our thriving nation."
 masterful_defenses: "Defensive Mastery"
 masterful_defenses_desc: "The ally of the Maghrebi people has always been defensive strategies since the arid land we inhabit is inherently hard to attack into. Where we live, the Christians of the north have strived to conquer before but have succumbed to the likes of the natural terrain whilst we were able to maintain ourselves in well placed defensive positions. Let us compound upon this mentality in the future and prepare even better defenses in the future for any invader who thinks that the Maghreb is an easy target for conquest."
 command_north_african_trade: "North African Trade"
 command_north_african_trade_desc: "The lucrative trade across North Africa is prized by many since it provides an alternative to the Christians across the sea. Not only this, but the Saharan trade routes also rely on trade routes throughout North Africa thus making our position even more lucrative. Capitalizing upon this and trying to make Maghrebi merchants and markets skilled and valuable will yield greater trade profits for the entirety of the region. If we're good enough at this, we might even be seen as a better alternative to the Christians in time!"
 maghrebi_guard: "Royal Maghrebi Guard"
 maghrebi_guard_desc: "We must not be as reliant on mercenaries and levied armies as much as we have before; the loyalty of these kinds of armies is fickle and prone to change when the tides of war change. The Maghreb must have its own professional, standing army that can help maintain the integrity of the entire nation better than any levied or mercenary-based army. This transition is going to take a fair amount of time and some groups within the Maghreb will not like this change, but we must be ready to adapt to the coming changes of the future."
 promote_barbary_pirates: "Corsair Traditions"
 promote_barbary_pirates_desc: "What else is the coast of the Maghreb known for? Piracy! Corsairs! Privateers! They've played a role in Maghrebi history for centuries now and have helped maintain the power of Maghrebi people against Christians to the north, therefore it is only natural that we would continue to fund and use them to our advantage. Let the coasts of our enemies and the merchant ships of our rivals know no peace!"
 formal_maghrebi_nation: "Formalize the Maghrebi Nation"
 formal_maghrebi_nation_desc: "Tribal confederacies and small kingdoms battling each other for dominance in battle, sometimes joining because of dynastic ties and breaking up because of petty disputes, the Maghreb has seen a very colorful history in this regard. This is, however, very much just that, history, for now we are ready to ascend to a new state that is beyond these squabbles and disputes. The dream of a united Maghreb is finally upon us and we must be ready to keep its administration in the best condition possible as it serves the people by promoting prosperity, growth, and unity."

 representation_of_russian_people_desc: "The Veche is the foundational building block of our republic and we must always hold it in high regard just as we did in decades before. From boyars to merchants to common citizens, they can and will be heard by the authorities of the land; they will be represented in our govenment when legislation is being passed and reforms are being made, and it is through them that Russia will be held up and propelled forward."
 system_of_tribute_and_taxes: "System of Tribute and Taxes"
 system_of_tribute_and_taxes_desc: "Through the legislative system of councils and magistrates in place, we can institute our republican values elsewhere. Though monarchs still thrive in this age, the ideals we hold as a republic can help mend and boost relations between us and our subjects who lie further away from the heart of the Russian Republic. Better this than enforcing harsh tribute on them and executing their officials on the spot for small matters, no, we must compromise and seek resolutions with them in a just and righteous way."
 strengthen_democratic_institutions: "Strengthen Republican Institutions"
 strengthen_democratic_institutions_desc: "We need not fall back into the times before the Veche was at our core, back to the days of princes and boyars running politics and abusing the peasants of the land like they were near slaves that they owned. Every adult Russian citizen in the Russian Republic must and will have a say in the legislative process. The council members as well as magistrates must adhere to the ideals we have had for decades now and we will be enforcing them at all possible points. It is through this triumph of republican values over the ones of monarchy that we will carve a future that is truly bright and glorious for the Russian people."
 beyond_the_urals: "Beyond the Urals"
 beyond_the_urals_desc: "The Ural Mountains were once the stopping point of the people of Novgorod; the tribes of the Urals had to pay tribute to Novgorod regularly though, times have certainly changed since they last paid tribute in that manner. We must now look past the Urals and toward the east where vast open swathes of land that can help maintain the strength of our republic and help ensure its prosperity for the future. Though the various tribes of the cold tundra and forests may resent us at first, they will learn to accept our authority over them."
 promoting_russian_arts: "Promote Russian Art"
 promoting_russian_arts_desc: "With several Eastern Orthodox Churches in our land as well as a magnificent cultural history backing the us up, it is no wonder that Russian art and architecture is able to flourish under us. The old days of monarchy restrained artistic styles at times, but we can become true patrons of many styles and develop a uniquely cultured feel to the landscape that few other nations can boast about. Not only this, but the marvelously built churches have also served to deepen the faith of our people, leading to more internal stability throughout Russian land."
 baltic_dominance: "Baltic Dominance"
 baltic_dominance_desc: "The Neva River and its bay have been crucial for trade opportunities and also for the Russian navy to get its start. The Baltic may traditionally be home to the Swedes, the Danish, and the Finnish, but the Russians are now becoming a key player too thanks to a multitude of factors. If we can secure more Baltic trade for ourselves and expand our shipyards further along the coast, we'll be able to reap control away from the pesky Scandinavians."
 reformed_military_standards: "Reformed Military Standards"
 reformed_military_standards_desc: "To defend the Russian Republic will require the utmost discipline and fighting power. We are not so entrenched in the past that we are going to fire arrows at our enemies who fire lead shot back at us, instead we will readily adopt the new firearms being used by other powers and incorporate them into our military so that they can use the new military standards devised in conjunction with modern weaponry. If we let our military become decadent, we risk losing the entire republic from war itself."

 dismantle_coastal_forts_desc: "The coasts of our adversaries are being fortified as it is against our efforts but this will not stand for long. We need to strengthen the weaponry on our ships and train our sailors better so that they can more effectively take down fortification after fortification from a distance. None near the water will be able to withstand the might of the Wokou for long!"
 force_open_trade_routes: "Force Open Trade Routes"
 force_open_trade_routes_desc: "The Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans are continually trying to block all trade with us. Few families and clans are willing to open their trade routes to us, meaning that many of our markets are starved of (shady) customers and merchants alike. This must be put to and end somehow; we must force open these trade routes by any means so that we can feel the blood that is trade flow smoothly again."
 command_the_waters: "Commanding the Waters"
 command_the_waters_desc: "The seas and open waters are valuable to many from all over the regions around us. Plenty of trading potential and power to be gained from controlling these waters, right? Well then we should capitalize on our already shady presence and make sure that the waters stretching from Northern Japan to Southern China are ours and only ours!"
 repurpose_enemy_ships: "Repurpose Enemy Ships"
 repurpose_enemy_ships_desc: "Not all of our enemies ships are useless once we defeat them, this is a simple fact we need to observe. Along with this, our own docks and harbors are not as high quality as those of China, Japan, or Korea, thus our capability to build ships is much more limited than many others around us. If we can effectively repair captured enemy ships and man them with enough sailors loyal to the Wokou, we can bolster our fleet numbers without nearly as much effort or resource spent."
 gunpowder_convoy_raids: "Gunpowder Convoy Raids"
 gunpowder_convoy_raids_desc: "Gunpowder is shipped around the waters we inhabit regularly and along coastal routes without end, meaning these transport routes are easily open to raids by our sailors and military. The more gunpowder we raid for and store up, the more firepower we will have later on for our ships and for our military, both of which we will need if we are to sustain our grip on power."
 multi_ethnic_formation: "The Many Wokou"
 multi_ethnic_formation_desc: "The Wokou are not just one simply population of people of Japanese, Korean, or Chinese descent, but rather it is an amalgamation of people from various cultural groups who have come together to take on a new life, one that promises better treatment and opportunity than what their previous life offered. Even the ones we capture eventually come around to joining the Wokou and with all these cultures within our ranks, it'd be wise for us to unite with them rather than discriminate against them."
 age_of_the_wokou: "The Age of the Wokou"
 age_of_the_wokou_desc: "They fight to keep us down, but the spirit and might of the Wokou cannot be tamed so easily. We do not readily submit to foreign authority like we all once had before and we will continually strive for an age where we are in charge. The age of the Wokou will come forth in some form or another, or we will die trying to see it through."

 cnut_the_greats_empire_desc: "The forebearer of our great empire, Cnut the Great, united the crowns of the Denmark, England, and Norway into one single political entity that was decentralized to a good degree. Following in Cnut's footsteps, we should not mistreat the churches or locals of the lands we conquer but instead slowly but surely bring the laws of Denmark upon them. Integration rather than straight and bloody conquest and the pillaging of each and every house we find is what we need."
 rulers_of_the_north_sea: "Rulers of the North Sea"
 rulers_of_the_north_sea_desc: "The North Sea is a prosperous and vital place that many ships cross through for trade and combat. Taking control of it entirely is what allowed the North Sea Empire of our ancestors to thrive and exert control over vast stretches of land. Our resurgent control of the North Sea will only serve to help propel our naval power to the ends of the Earth."
 divide_and_rule: "Divide and Rule"
 divide_and_rule_desc: "The concept of 'divide and conquer/rule' is not a new one since the it has been employed in the times of the Greeks and Romans from centuries before. The North Sea Empire is perhaps another beneficiary of such a political outline since dividing up our lands and our territories into certain departments, provinces, and sectors can ease the burden on our administration as a whole."
 fierce_norse_fighters: "Ferocity of Norse Fighters"
 fierce_norse_fighters_desc: "Norse fighters, from the lands of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, are renowned for their ferocity and might. Though not the most disciplined or the most technologically advanced at times, they were universally seen as fearsome and courageous warriors that were to be feared. This legacy lives on in the blood of our soldiers to this very day and we will see to it that they fight with the same valor as people from our lands did in centuries past!"
 english_administrative_structures: "Comprehensive Administration"
 english_administrative_structures_desc: "The English have developed certain administrative structures and techniques that Denmark well, has struggled to develop over the decades. Mired by political struggles in the north and south, we could can and should incorporate some of the English techniques of administration into our own so that we can better manage the vast swathes of land in the North Sea Empire."
 enforce_danelaw: "Rekindle and Expand the Danelaw"
 enforce_danelaw_desc: "The Danelaw was both an administrative structure used by the Danes from the 880s onward (after the formalization of the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum in 886) and a term for where the Danes took control of and held sway in the British Isles. It is only right that the North Sea Empire revive the Danelaw and refine it over time, bringing the Isles closer into fold of the Danes and more prosperous as a whole."
 might_of_the_north_sea_empire: "The Might of the North Sea"
 might_of_the_north_sea_empire_desc: "From the mighty northern waters, fjords, and coasts is where we of the North Sea Empire shall descend upon the world. Our military and navy will be ready to fend off any invasion into our lands and after the pikes of our enemies shatter upon our shields, we will repay them for what they did with added interest.

External forces have helped push us in this direction undoubtedly and it is felt by all who assemble by the Seven Council Fires that strength and determination must come through unity. Through this unity, we will expand our borders outward and make allies out of the other tribal people we come to encompass."
 councils_of_the_nakota: "The Wichiyena Councils"
 councils_of_the_nakota_desc: "The Wichiyena (otherwise known as the Nakota though this is a misnomer) encompass the Yankton and Yanktonai peoples and their history as the middle Sioux has been integral to the very heart of our confederacy. Unlike the other councils, they are less oriented to warfare and are more keen on internal matters like societal cohesion as opposed to making new warrior societies. It is with the words of these two that the nation will thrive with administrative prowess."
 reformation_of_sioux_politics: "Reform the Political Structure"
 reformation_of_sioux_politics_desc: "The previous tribal makeup of the Sioux people has had a lasting effect on relations at all levels of society. From small-scale communities to previous chiefs who are now leaders with different titles, tribal feuds and debts are still seen as playing a large part in our politics and it makes for a great number of messy endeavors, unfortunately. By making a concentrated effort to make sure these old feuds and debts are repaid and resolved, we can ensure that the nation is strong at its very core."
 councils_of_the_lakota: "The Teton Councils"
 councils_of_the_lakota_desc: "The Teton (otherwise known as the Lakota) most disciplined and war-like group within our nation. Comprising of three councils (the Northern, Central, and Southern Lakota) and showing just how fierce they are when fighting other people on the plains, it should come as no surprise that they wield a great amount of influence. Balancing out their power and influence with the others is key, and utilizing their adaptation to the changing technologies of warfare will serve to help modernize us as a whole."
 plains_warfare: "Ruthless Plains Warfare"
 plains_warfare_desc: "The Great Plains is where the bison roam and where several people groups come to clash over hunting grounds and territorial rights. We are no stranger to this at all, and with the dawn of the age of gunpowder weapons well upon us, it would do us well to utilize this power on horseback and on foot. The shock of cavalry charges and long range skirmishing on either horseback or on foot will serve to drive out any enemy of the Seven Council Fires."
 councils_of_the_dakota: "The Santee Councils"
 councils_of_the_dakota_desc: "The Santee (otherwise known as the Dakota) have brought their experience in from the east when they were defeated by the Ojibwe people around Lake Superior. The integration of their traditions and customs from outside the Great Plains has helped our nation become more welcoming of outsiders, though that does not mean we will let foreigners seize land from us unfairly. What happened to the Santee will not happen to us and we will be sure of it."
 seven_fires_to_light_our_way: "Seven Fires Light the Way"
 seven_fires_to_light_our_way_desc: "As we look to the future, it is very much a shroud of fog that we can't see past. Some are scared of what lurks behind the fog, could disaster await the Sioux people? Or could there be a great age of Sioux expansion and prosperity? Whatever is waiting for us in the future, the Seven Council Fires will be there to light the way for a strong, unified, and capable people. No matter the challenge we may face, the Sioux will bring all they can against it and overcome it."

Those who came across the great waters to our land know not of these religious principles and instead want us to embrace their own, but their bloodless rituals will not sustain the world. We will guide them by force or by coercion to what is truly meant for this realm."
 meritocratic_military_ranks: "Ranks of the Nahua"
 meritocratic_military_ranks_desc: "The Aztecs and those around them blessed the greater region of Nahua people with military skills, but corruption in the form of noble bloodlines and wealthy individuals seeking to buy ranks in the military are what hold us back. Let us embark on a path that leads to a more skillful and merit-based military ranking system that relies on actual fighting technique and military knowledge."

 refine_the_colonizing_system_desc: "We have triumphed over the deathly blows our enemies across the water sought to deal to us, learning and cultivating a new and revitalized state for the Nahua people. Now the task is to spread forth, claim what lands are rightfully ours, and bring forth a new age of dominance stemming from our heartland."
 refine_the_tributary_system: "New Nahua Tributaries"
 refine_the_tributary_system_desc: "The way warfare was back during the time of Aztec dominance in the region led to subjugation of smaller alteptls, exacting tribute from them in the form of slaves, prisoners-of-war, or food and resources. Now that times have changed, we must take to refining that old way of warfare and subjugation whilst also instituting a more structured way of exacting tribute from our subjects."
 cultivation_of_harsh_land: "Cultivation of Harsh Land"
 cultivation_of_harsh_land_desc: "The jungles and highlands of our native region are not the easiest to make do with. We have managed to build great buildings and grand farming structures sure, but with new technology and ideas coming into our society at a consistent rate, we would be better off cultivating the land with more advanced methods. Chinampas and other farming methods, as an example, could be vastly improved with the new equipment we have been able to obtain."
 currency_transition: "Minting Nahua Coinage"
 currency_transition_desc: "The currency of the international markets is not what our ancestors would have used at all. Whilst our military traditions are stronger than many others, our finances are going to lag behind if we cannot start minting our own coins and controlling the flow of money into and out of Nahua territory. Thus, a large scale endeavor will be needed to start this process, but we will get it done in time."

 write_the_yukars: "Writing of the Yukars"
 write_the_yukars_desc: "Great stories of heroism and sorrow, people from our past and spirits along our path, these are what the yukars tell of. Spoken in our own language for as long as we can remember, these Yukars have made us masters of narration and memory as time has gone on. But with each death of an Ainu elder, a library of information is lost with them and we cannot recover everything from their death. Thus, we should begin writing down these Yukars for future generations to read instead of relying purely on oral testimony from generation to generation."
 bring_back_what_japan_once_was: "Jomon Land Once Again"
 bring_back_what_japan_once_was_desc: "Long ago, the Jomon people roamed the lands of Japan without fear and lived off the land freely. Then, as one of our Yukar tells, the Children of the Sun came and began settling on the lands of Japan and eventually stirring tensions with the Jomon people. Though the Jomon people eventually lost this great struggle over the centuries, their descendants that are us, the Ainu people, are now able to reclaim the land that they lost gradually. The Wajin/Yayoi (old name for Japanese people) will know firsthand the atrocities they inflicted upon our people."
 reprisal_against_the_wajin: "Reprisal Against the Wajin"
 reprisal_against_the_wajin_desc: "The Wajin have waged wars and dealt horrible losses to the Ainu people both in the recent and distant past; they care not for our lives or culture. Just as they have done to us in the past, we will do to them and inflict harrowing losses on the Wajin in open combat. Whether it is by the shrines they hold dear or the castles they build to protect themselves, the Wajin and any others in Japan will fall to our people."
 judged_by_others_in_the_community: "Refine the Judgement of People"
 judged_by_others_in_the_community_desc: "Traditionally, Ainu communities judged crimes via communal judgement. Various amounts of people could gather in and help decide what should be done to a criminal, but we are finding this system to be too unwieldy for our growing state. If we can set up a strong court system that takes some notes from how the Wajin structured their legal system, the Ainu people can build up a robust set of rules and laws that effectively deal with crimes and people who commit said crimes."
 the_kamuy_guide_us_to_war: "The Kamuy and Warfare"
 the_kamuy_guide_us_to_war_desc: "Our traditional religion entails animism to a large degree. Kamuy Fuchi, goddess of the hearth, Kim-un- Kamuy, the god of bears and mountains, Repun Kamuy, god of the sea, and Kotan-kar-kamuy, the creator of the world, are just some of the the spirits that are encompassed in the term 'kamuy'. Through our transformations as a people, the Kamuy have come to symbolize a great many things for the Ainu people, but with the sounds of war never far off, we must seek out what answers the kamuy have in regards to conflict with our neighbors. Through their guidance, we will be able to establish a strong faith for the Ainu people in times of peace and in times of war."
 chasi_forts_secure_trade: "Chashi for our Trade Routes"
 chasi_forts_secure_trade_desc: "Hill forts in our land, traditionally called 'Chashi', have been around for a long time and they served to protect vital areas of trade (which were usually along the banks of nearby rivers). These fortifications can prove to be even more useful if we build them up further with new defensive measures like strong stone walls and intricate garrison systems, similar to what the Wajin use in their own lands."
 unify_the_ainu_people: "Unify the Ainu"
 unify_the_ainu_people_desc: "To unite all of the scattered Ainu people is a tough task as many are on remote islands or have not contacted us in ages. We must reach out to them instead with our own officials and soldiers ready to greet them with warm smiles and gifts of food and materials. Once we've incorporated all the Ainu settlements into our domain, we can still use this expansionist policy toward other places that are relatively unorganized and unclaimed; the legacy of the Ainu people will reach to where the sun sets and where the sun rises!"

 ainu_wajin_feud_settling_desc: "Whilst we do not exactly like the Wajin and what they've done to our ancestors that were the Jomon and the Emishi people, we realize that we cannot exactly live without what they have built up. If we work to settle past feuds on the local level and also work to incorporate the Wajin into our administration alongside our own people, we'll be able to pass much more effective laws and regulations throughout our republic."
 representation_of_all_in_ezo: "Represent All in Ezo"
 representation_of_all_in_ezo_desc: "Some may not exactly be keen on representing all the people in Ezo, but many upper level officials realize that not representing the various people in Ezo will lead to a great amount of unrest that will help topple our government. Our strength not only comes from the Ainu people, but also from the other people in Ezo and ensuring that they are taken care of by our administration; this republican ideal is exactly what will help us keep our cohesive state together for ages without end."

Through our transformations as a people, the Kamuy are becoming more of a symbol of our steadfast nature as a people and how great our endurance is despite outside influences from Buddhism and Shintoism. The Kamuy shall show us a bright future, one where peace is had through words and writing instead of through constant bloodshed."
 to_defend_ezo_itself: "In Defense of Ezo"
 to_defend_ezo_itself_desc: "Ezo must be defended at all costs, it is as simple as that. Our home must have a honored military guard and a strong navy the likes of which our previous generations of people have never seen before. Guardians of our land will stand ready for whatever strikes out from the sea, and when we claim land through conquest, we will ensure that it is maintained as a vital territory similar to how our capital is."

 through_talk_and_blood_desc: "The word of the prophet must spread to all corners of the world, as most Muslims already know, but the lands of Lusong and nearby islands are rife with beliefs that are heterodox to what is recorded in the Quran. Whether it is through gentle persuasion and knowledge sharing or through religious wars of great bloodshed, we will spread Islam to the the various islands that Lusong will come to control and there will be unity amongst the people."
 multiple_hearts_of_trade: "Multiple Hearts of Trade"
 multiple_hearts_of_trade_desc: "The lands of Tondo, Madyas, Cebu, and other places in our home islands are great centers of trade and commerce. They have been this way for centuries what with merchants from the west and north coming to these tropical paradises to do business, and now that we are unified into a single political entity, there is nothing stopping us from profiting even more from these centers of trade! Come, let us build up a few more structures in these cities and build them up higher so that the money never stops flowing into Lusong!"
 muslim_merchant_fleets: "Armed Muslim Merchants"
 muslim_merchant_fleets_desc: "The waters around us are dangerous for Muslims and they have been for generations now. Buddhist, Hindu, and sometimes even Christian ships float around these islands and are willing to contest Muslims for trade rights throughout the entire region. It is time that we fight back and arm the Muslim merchants of Lusong with gunpowder weapons and techniques that stem from the great bastions of Islam in the west like Persia and Arabia."
 protected_coasts_of_lusong: "Protections of Lusong"
 protected_coasts_of_lusong_desc: "The tropical paradises Lusong holds as its own are not just a joy to visit and do business inside of, but they are also quite hard to take via invasion. We are building up the defensive structures around these centers of trade, yes, but they are also situated in a region that is plagued by heavy rains, tropical diseases, and rough landing spots if they aren't landing at a designated port or harbor. Keeping these factors in mind and playing our defense around these defensive tactics will ensure that few invaders will be able to even touch the walls of our cities."
 expertise_in_mercantile_matters: "A History of Expertise"
 expertise_in_mercantile_matters_desc: "From the time of the 700s and 800s, Muslim merchants sailed far and wide in the Indian Ocean to not only spread the word of Islam, but also to make money and do business wherever they could. Such a legacy of expertise in mercantile matters is something we have in our blood and we will use it as much as possible to bring in greater profits."
 more_and_more_islands: "The Nation of Islands"
 more_and_more_islands_desc: "Our heritage lies not only in being a nation of traders and sialors, no, the other key element in our heritage is being a nation of islanders as well. Our home islands, connected by a common sense of culture and religion, hold immense power within them and we only need to channel it through strong and righteous authority our own people. Once we have done this, we can look toward other islands where our kin have settled upon and bring them into the fold, or perhaps even sail off and find new land for people of Lusong to inhabit."
 influx_of_muslims_scholars: "The Muslims Bastion of the East"
 influx_of_muslims_scholars_desc: "We are perhaps the furthest bastion of islam there is, far from the deserts of Arabia and mountains of Persia. This gives us a unique place in the world of Islam as, though there are several other sultans and emirs to our west, they do not have the perspective nor the connections that we have. In time, this reputation as being the 'eastern bastion of Islam' will garner us more scholars of Islam and we will utilize them as much as possible in our court."
 indianization_of_the_islands: "Ancient Influences..."
 indianization_of_the_islands_desc: "The culture of the subcontinent, the traditions of Hinduism, and the legacy that was imparted onto us from the days of the Chola Empire... All of these have come together into the nation we are today. Various facets of our culture are undeniably influenced by the grand and extensive history of Indian culture spreading throughout the islands of Southeast Asia and it is through this Indianization that many new ideas were imparted onto our people centuries ago. Such a history of cultural change and innovation via cultural exchange is what we can foster as we go forth into the future."
 bastion_of_brahmic_tradition: "Bastion of Hinduism"
 bastion_of_brahmic_tradition_desc: "As Islam and Buddhism fire arrows at each other and do battle over the various islands of Southeast Asia, Hinduism has found a safe haven in the likes of Lusong. These islands have known a number of traditions in the past and are still home to small pockets of Muslims, Buddhists, and Anito followers, but we are not going to impose harsh restrictions on them. Though Hinduism may be dominant in our administration and various cities, we are willing to come to terms with these other faiths."
 promote_further_indianization: "... Renewed in Lusong"
 promote_further_indianization_desc: "Even though Lusong can feel the influences from ancient times, that does not mean it should simply shrug them off and keep them only to Lusong. Indianization spread to many, many islands and areas all throughout Southeast Asia in past centuries, it is only right that they come back to the tradition that gave many of these cultures initial footing so long ago."
 dominate_nusantara: "Calls to War"
 dominate_nusantara_desc: "Much like how we refused to accept the dominance of foreigners on our own shores, there are those around the lands of Southeast Asia who refuse to accept the dominance of Lusong soldiers and sailors in their land. We will need to strengthen our resolve and build up our forces if we are to take over our rivals in the regions around us since many would see the light of the Brahmic tradition in the east snuffed out altogether."
 confucian_buddhist_trade: "Trade from the North"
 confucian_buddhist_trade_desc: "The northern trade routes from the Chinese and from the Vietnamese and Cham people are lucrative in what they provide. Various riches and luxury goods flowing into our markets whilst at the same time giving us a mercantile template to follow for ages to come, there are many merchants in Lusong that are trying to emulate the soft dominance that was projected into Lusong's northern area from ages ago."
 harmony_with_other_faiths: "Inter-Faith Peace"
 harmony_with_other_faiths_desc: "There is no use in trying to enforce the practices of Buddhism and Confucianism through heavy-handed trading measures, it will only invoke harsh reprisals against us in the future. Instead, we should attempt to come to peace with other people of various faiths so that we can have a much more honorable and reputable name in the numerous markets around us."
 gunpowdcer_from_the_north: "Gunpowder Imports"
 gunpowdcer_from_the_north_desc: "Gunpowder is no longer a secret held by just the Chinese and the innovations that those around us have made with gunpowder are absolutely astounding. Adopting it as quickly as we can for our soldiers and sailors will give them the power they need both on land and at sea to fend off rival armies and navies, but we will always need to refine the tactics we use with gunpowder weapons so that we do not become stagnant in our military capabilities."
 tributaries_of_our_own: "Tributaries of Lusong"
 tributaries_of_our_own_desc: "Much like how the various states of Southeast Asia adopted tributary states instead trying to directly annex land, we of Lusong will adopt this route as well. Having a network of tributary states can be much more beneficial to Lusong since they still provide yearly influxes of various materials whilst also projecting the influence of Lusong into various other regions we are in."
 encompass_all_of_the_archipelago: "The Efforts of All Islands"
 encompass_all_of_the_archipelago_desc: "There are several places in our state that hold beliefs that are strange to the usual Anito way of thinking about spirituality and life, but we do not come at these different faiths with hostility. The Lusong administration is going to work with these communities of people so that they do not feel alienated in the land they've regarded as home for generations; in time, their efforts will be gathered with all others inside Lusong and there will be a unified military and navy that can defend our state regardless of what happens."
 masterful_sailors: "Masterful Sailors"
 masterful_sailors_desc: "Home to great sailors and merchants, others might perceive Lusong as perhaps no different to those of Sumatra and Java but this is far from the truth. The difference with us lies in just how well we can master the waves and wind around us with regards to sailing, and when fights break out between hostile ships and our own, our sailors are more than capable of punching above their weight. It is time that we put these sailors to good use in a unified Lusong fleet."
 harbors_and_naval_bases: "Harbors, Docks, and Naval Bases"
 harbors_and_naval_bases_desc: "The nature of Lusong as a state makes having good places to dock ships a priority. The more we build in terms of harbors for trade, docks for building ships, and naval bases for securing territory, the more Lusong will prosper as a whole. Few can boast just how much of a vital position we are in with regards to being able to field a massive fleet of ships, and few will ever be able to match our strength in this regard."
 fertility_and_unity: "Prosperity from Unity"
 fertility_and_unity_desc: "Through the collective efforts of all Lusong people regardless of their religious adherence, we are seeing a new age of prosperity and prestige. Villages are expanding, coastal towns and cities are becoming larger than ever, and the productive potential in our land is higher than ever before. If we can keep up this sense of unity in the face of new threats on the horizon, Lusong will be able to become stronger than any other power in Southeast Asia."

It is our duty to reunite the lost Anishinaabe people back into the Council of Three Fires and become whole once more in the face of incoming hardship from the east."
 ojibwe_tempered_ambition: "Tempered Ambition"
 ojibwe_tempered_ambition_desc: "The ambition of the our older brother, the Ojibwe, is strong and akin to that of fires in a great raid, yet they have been pushed back time and time again along with the rest of the Anishinaabe people. If we can manage the ambitions of old and new together and formulate proper plans for the future, we can efficiently wage wars of conquest in the future."

 potawatomi_seven_grandfather_teachings_desc: "Carried forth from generations past to the present are the Seven Grandfather Teachings from our Younger Brother, the Potawatomi. Each child in our nation learns these teachings: wisdom, respect, love, honesty, humility, bravery, and truth toward each other and all creation, though we do try to keep them on the righteous path when they go off course as some inevitably do. It is these teachings that help ground the Anishinaabe people and help keep the peace within our grand state."

Despite what others might think of us, the Ottawa do a great job at representing Anishinaabe interests in markets all around us."

 ojibwe_keepers_of_the_faith_desc: "The keepers of our traditional faith are the Ojibwe and they take great care in the rituals performed as well as the materials used.

 potawatomi_keepers_for_the_fire_desc: "Lastly, to keep our fire safe and burning throughout all of the future ages are the Potawatomi. Though they are perhaps the meekest of all of us, they are also perhaps the most vital to keeping our internal structure of cooperation, development, and political unity intact. As we grow, prosper, and expand outward, the Potawatomi will be there at every step of the way keeping our fires lit, our path bright, and our people uplifted."
 ottawa_keepers_of_trade: "The Ottawa, Keepers of Trade"
 ottawa_keepers_of_trade_desc: "And as our influence spreads forth, the keepers of trade that are the Ottawa will be there to ensure that markets far outside of our territory still feel the prosperous influence of Anishinaabe merchants. There is a great amount of money to be made as we expand our trade routes and avenues for production, we just need to channel this money through the Ottawa."

Foreigners may try to cut down vegetation to get open lines of sight or take time to scan the area in front of them before taking their shots, but the Tupi know this land all too well.

It stands approximately 260 ft. tall with an octagonal base of about 97 ft., and it is built mostly out of white porcelain bricks to reflect the sun's rays during the day. Truly in keeping the Porcelain Tower maintained for all to see, it is a monument not only to the dedication to our people, but also to the governance of the land that we call our own."

It is a center of trade for many cities surrounding it, it is situated in a great location for development, and it can have defensive positions built around it as time goes on. Not only this, but it has been used as capital for a number of previous great dynasties of the Middle Kingdom, giving it a reputation unlike many other cities around us.

 the_sichuan_dialect_desc: "Long ago, before the likes of the Qin Dynasty, the Sichuan basin was very distinct in culture and language from the rest of the Middle Kingdom and its plethora of slightly different forms of Chinese culture. It was not until the Sichuan people were annexed that they became mixed together with Chinese culture as a whole, yet there remains a distinct identity for Sichuanese people, especially those living in Xijing. Our dialect is quite unique when compared to other places such as Luoyang or Suzhou and it is this facet of our culture that will make us stand out as a truly unique contender for the Mandate of Heaven."

Whilst the name 'Sichuan' itself may stem more from the name 'Four Plain Circuits' as opposed to 'Four Rivers', these rivers provide deal of irrigation and productivity to the land in and around our capital city.

Though there have been multiple times where the defenses at the edge of the basin were broken by a variety of forces, we will ensure that refugees who are currently looking for a place to hold out in will find Xijing and its surrounding land as a new home. All we ask for is partial military service so long as they are living within our territory."

 foreign_entries_of_the_south_desc: "We are on one of the frontiers of Chinese culture, more or less, due to the fact that we border the Viet, Zhuang, and other non-Chinese cultures to our west and south. Though we do skirmish with some of them at our border, we shouldn't be so keen on annexing all of them as quick as we can since it will be hard to administrate such dense tropical terrain from afar. Instead, we should welcome the foreigners and keep up diplomatically with them, slowly bringing them into our fold as the years go by."
 new_center_of_chinese_growth: "New Center of Growth"
 new_center_of_chinese_growth_desc: "There are some who would doubt the prospects of a thriving southern state in the entirety of the Middle Kingdom, but we are living proof that it can happen with enough unity and strength. Our example is bringing more and more people to our cause and soon enough, we'll have soldiers from every major city in the Middle Kingdom under our banners. Can any other state say that with confidence?"
 more_than_dangerous_trading: "Dangerous Waters"
 more_than_dangerous_trading_desc: "The waters of the east toward Suzhou and Beijing are safer than the waters around Guangzhou. We must contend with traders who speak radically different languages and practice a myriad of religions, meaning that piracy, smugglers, and coastal raiders are a much larger threat for us. We are not without our own tactics, however, as we can just as easily turn these tricks on our enemies via utilizing our fleet in a number of ways. Trade is good and all, but when it is being undermined by foreigners who do not care for trade, we will force them to care."
 migrations_southward_from_northern_chaos: "Migrations to the South"
 migrations_southward_from_northern_chaos_desc: "To migrate across the Middle Kingdom so that you may find safety is not new at all. Past fractures of power have made migrations necessary for many groups of people, meaning different areas get an influx of manpower and productive potential. The current state of politics in the Middle Kingdom is spurring on a migration as it is though perhaps it is not as large as previous ones. Still it is granting us a great amount of military potential that we can use in our efforts to push northward."
 amends_with_the_western_expanse: "Amending with the Zhuang"
 amends_with_the_western_expanse_desc: "The Zhuang people to our west, along with a variety of other smaller groups of people, have been disconnected from the rest of the Middle Kingdom for centuries. Though some consider them to be Chinese, their language and culture is far from being anything like that of the Sichuanese or Cantonese. We must rein these scattered people in through a coordinated and peaceful process so that we have a larger base of power to draw from in the future, and a secure western flank."
 the_capital_of_guangzhou: "The Capital of Guangzhou"
 the_capital_of_guangzhou_desc: "Naturally a port for traders and a city for eager merchants, Guangzhou is quickly becoming the epicenter of our state and the entire region that surrounds it. Keeping up with trade practices and protecting what water ways we can so that merchants always feel welcome and safe in Guangzhou will propel the city upwards and bring unprecedented amounts of prosperity to it. In time, it may even pass the likes of Nanjing or Beijing in terms of wealth."

 robust_northern_bueracracy_desc: "The north has always been a haven for bureaucracy and administration since Xi'an, Luoyang, and Beijing have been traditional seats of power for previous dynasties. Ancient roots are found within these cities and these ancient roots still give life to grand advisors alongside strong administrators who know exactly how to enforce laws that get passed. If our enemies are deprived of such good bureaucrats, they surely will not last long in this world."
 on_the_northern_frontier: "Frontier of the North"
 on_the_northern_frontier_desc: "We border the harsh lands of the Mongols and Jurchens to the north and northeast. Though they feud over their own politics and pay little attention to us at times, we cannot count on them being disunited forever. We need to build up our defenses along the Great Wall and renovate it as much as we can so that we can hold out against any northern invasion in the future."
 recruit_nomadic_mercenaries: "Deals with the Steppe Nomads"
 recruit_nomadic_mercenaries_desc: "And just as we make preparations to defend against Mongols and Jurchens alike, we must also be ready to negotiate mercenary contracts with them should those times come. Our traditional enemies are feared with their bows and horses and we could use them in certain conflicts throughout the Middle Kingdom, we just need to pick and choose where they might be most effective."
 imperial_military_prepartions: "Imperial Military Preparations"
 imperial_military_prepartions_desc: "Our ascendance to imperial authority is slowly coming about and soon enough, the entire Middle Kingdom will be under our control. Though, in order to properly do conquests inside and outside the Middle Kingdom, we are going to need a truly imperial military that is organized and well supplied with munitions and materials. Ensuring these logistics are taken care of will help ease the burden of financially managing our troops in the future."
 strict_military_divisions: "Strict Military Divisions"
 strict_military_divisions_desc: "Utilizing our preparations from before and also drawing on some past wisdom from previous dynasties and the strategies they used, we will begin putting these divisions of regiments into use with a distinct focus on infantry. They are the lifeblood of our state and will be what carries us to ultimate victory over the other states in the Middle Kingdom."

 the_capital_of_beijing_desc: "Being founded so long ago and holding so many wondrous buildings inside of it, including the famed Forbidden City, there are few cities that can stand up to the prestige that Beijing radiates outward. It will once again be the heart of administration in the entirety of the Middle Kingdom, and it will be where the Son of Heaven rests with the Imperial Mandate."

The culmination of power, authority, and prosperity is under our authority with no other being able to contest our claim to the Mandate of Heaven or the whole of the Middle Kingdom.

 an_end_to_warring_states: "The End to the Warring States"
 an_end_to_warring_states_desc: "Swords and spears, muskets and arrows, all forms of weaponry were utilized to try to gain power amongst the warring states, but it seems that it was only thanks to our hard work both in the field of battle and at the negotiating table that peace was able to come back to the Middle Kingdom. The heavens have blessed us with the strength to get to this point, now it is time for us to honor the heavens through our good deeds and offerings and also give back to the people through meticulous and careful planning from the top down."

 reclaiming_ancient_heritage_desc: "The Xia Dynasty is mythical in many respects, but for most people in our lands the Xia Dynasty is where the Chinese people started their rise to greatness. Whether they speak one dialect or another, they still work to contribute toward the greater tree of Chinese culture that has blossomed from the very seeds planted by the Xia Dynasty. It is time that this heritage of ours was properly reclaimed and examined with a keen and patient set of eyes."
 two_crownings_and_three_respects: "The Two Crownings and Three Respects"
 two_crownings_and_three_respects_desc: "Unlike what some foreigners might think of our dynastic rises and falls from the past, the new dynasty that comes to power usually gives powerful positions to the old royal family so that said old royalty are not shunned from society or sent off into exile. Indeed they still hold sway in some circles even after being taken down from power and indeed we of the Later Xia will enact just such a policy to those were previously in power."
 splendor_of_ancestor_veneration: "Veneration of our Ancestors"
 splendor_of_ancestor_veneration_desc: "Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism influences the various lives of our citizens in a myriad of ways, but if there is one constant throughout our entire history it is the fact that we respect and honor our ancestors no matter what. These traditions should not be shunned away as new ideas come into our land, but rather these traditions should be enshrined as part of our grand heritage and made to show just how much we pay attention to our past."
 empowered_by_the_stories: "Empowering Heroism"
 empowered_by_the_stories_desc: "The past is rife with tales of heroism, bravery, and great figures of both moral goodness and spiritual goodness. These classic and ancient tales, especially those from the Xia Dynasty in our ancient past, should be preserved as much as possible and perhaps made into live plays so that not only are our citizens inspired, but also so that our military are inspired. If we can adopt the heroic attitude and courage that some of these mythical figures had, who knows just how far we could get in future wars."
 the_finality_of_the_middle_kingdom: "The Finality of the Xia"
 the_finality_of_the_middle_kingdom_desc: "Some in our court think of our coming about as a sort of fulfillment of the past. They see us, the Later Xia, as the finality of the Middle Kingdom and the embodiment of old traditions revived with new and grand ideas. Whether or not this is actually true is up for debate, but we should not relax now and take things easy just because our courtiers say nice things about us. We should use this up-and-coming reputation as a way to strengthen ourselves from the inside out, cultivating a developed and structured state that can defend itself no matter what happens."

 legacy_of_the_oracle_bones: "Legacy of the Oracle Bones"
 legacy_of_the_oracle_bones_desc: "The Shang Dynasty of old was very intent on divining answers from oracle bones. Questions submitted to deities would be submitted via carvings into bonues or shells and the subsequent cracks on the bones/shells would be what determines the answers to the questions (interpreted by a skilled person of course). Whilst we do not practice such rituals anymore, these practices of trying to ascertain answers to pressing matters still comes through in prayers to our ancestors and various deities. Perhaps it is time our ruler begins doing public prayers and rituals so as to reassure the public at times."
 age_old_steppe_nomad_rivalries: "Age Old Rivals"
 age_old_steppe_nomad_rivalries_desc: "The people of the steppe that often times refuse to submit to our authority also refused to submit to Shang authority in the past; such rivalries between nomadic and settled people never seem to go away. The Shang, though, were not strong enough to venture our and defeat the nomads in the steppe and instead increased their defensive position when it was possible. Though some would find it strange for us to do this, it is a viable strategy and can stop the advance of not only nomadic neighbors, but also regular foot soldiers with siege equipment."
 compound_upon_shang_diplomacy: "Internal Diplomacy"
 compound_upon_shang_diplomacy_desc: "The internals of the Shang Dynasty were basic and not very strong as one might expect. Distant rulers who were still nominally beneath the head of the Shang Dynasty had a great amount of autonomy and often times the Shang king needed to make alliances with these people who were supposedly still inside the Shang domain. Though we have much better communication and stronger administration all around, we should learn to have a strong internal network of diplomacy going on so that we can know just what exactly is going on even in the furthest reaches of our empire."
 order_amongst_religious_life: "Ordered Religious Matters"
 order_amongst_religious_life_desc: "Just as how the Shang Dynasty of old had their religious matters calculated out via assigning various officials to tasks like divination and tomb preparation, we too shall have our religious matters squared away. If we allow the religious sector to go untouched for too long, corruption could easily creep in and start making us bleed from the inside out. Controlling clerical matters is just something that must be done so that the state can be even more fully realized to its greatest extent."
 the_focus_on_town_upkeep: "Garrisons Upon Garrisons"
 the_focus_on_town_upkeep_desc: "Taking our defensive mentality one step further with defensive artillery and even more layers of walls is exactly what we need! What our towns used to see as just stone walls and towers protecting them from outside dangers will become armorie and training facilities fit for making sure no enemy can hold a siege for long, lest they wish to encounter both a powerful Later Shang army and a hardened Later Shang sortie."

 cut_down_the_power_of_kings: "Divide up Internal Power"
 cut_down_the_power_of_kings_desc: "We have read about several pieces of the old Han Dynasty, but we of the later Han must look closely at the Rebellion of the Seven States and what was done after it. After this disastrous time, the Imperial Court enacted a series of reforms to better divide up the land of the Han Dynasty so that large chunks of territory could not so easily rebel. We of the Later Han must also look at doing the same since we could face similar issues if we allow large sections of the land to be ruled by singular authorities."
 discipline_of_frontier_life: "Frontier Discipline"
 discipline_of_frontier_life_desc: "The invasions of the Han Dynasty into the western reaches and taking over the old places like Shule and Loulan was remarkable to say the least. The Protectorate of Western Regions, as it was called back then, instilled a great deal of discipline in soldiers who were stationed there but it also gave rise to the possible danger of soldiers rebelling and splitting off. Still, a frontier region is valuable even to us as we know just how vital it can be to maintaining influence elsewhere and enhancing our own troop quality, even if it means the possibility of soldiers rising up later on."
 the_blurring_of_the_four_occupations: "The Changes we Can't Stop"
 the_blurring_of_the_four_occupations_desc: "The traditional view of the Four Occupations (gentry scholars, peasant farmers, artisans/craftsmen, and merchants/traders) has held sway in the culture of the Middle Kingdom for centuries without end, but as times change and we see the fruits of global trade connecting states like never before, the Four Occupations as a concept is unfolding and the classes of society are blending together somewhat. Instead of fighting this change, we should embrace it and actively work with the people in these new emerging social classes so that we can produce more internally."
 establishing_dutiful_subjects: "Dutiful Subjects"
 establishing_dutiful_subjects_desc: "It is not enough to simply project power internally amongst our various internal pieces of land. We must also strive to do as the Han Dynasty of old did and project our power outward either through conquest or diplomacy. Whatever route we take, we can rest assured that our envoys and diplomats are doing their work in keeping up with the politics of our subject states and collecting what tribute is necessary from them."
 the_issue_of_conufcianism_and_taoism: "Confucianism & Taoism"
 the_issue_of_conufcianism_and_taoism_desc: "Mending the teachings of Taoism, Confucianism, and Legalism is by no means an easy task, but scholars and administrators alike are capable of sifting through the dense words and thick passages to make a cohesive understanding of all three. Just like the Han Dynasty of before and how it mended these three together, so to will we for the great good of the people themselves. Harmony at every level of society!"

 the_most_capable_son_shall_rule: "The Most Capable Heir"
 the_most_capable_son_shall_rule_desc: "The Liao Dynasty of old had to contend with serious issues of their steppe traditions conflicting with traditions of the Middle Kingdom, one of these issues being how the Khitan people usually handled succession. We realize that how the Khitans of old did it, that is choosing the most capable son as the rightful heir, is much better than having the oldest born son being the heir since sometimes our oldest son is not viable for one reason or another. Merit over status! That is what we need!"
 khitan_legacy: "Khitan Legacy"
 khitan_legacy_desc: "The Khitan people had to inherently be accepting of other cultures, especially the culture of the Middle Kingdom since it was a very lucrative place to hold sway over. Despite adopting some traditions from the Middle Kingdom, the Liao Dynasty kept true to many of their own traditions and attempted to mesh the two groups together at times. Though their efforts more or less failed back then, we can strive to complete their efforts as we go into the future."
 experience_from_the_steppe: "Steppe Experience"
 experience_from_the_steppe_desc: "The blood of the Khitans was similar to the blood of other steppe people like the Mongols and the Jurchens: teeming with cavalry capability, particularly when it came to head-on cavalry strategies. Now that the Later Liao is reviving some of these old Khitan traditions, being skilled in cavalry warfare will be something we strive for so that we may carry on the legacy of old."
 parallel_administrative_bodies: "Two Administrations for Two Lands"
 parallel_administrative_bodies_desc: "What the Liao Dynasty of old attempted to do what put in place two parallel administrations: One for the lands of the Khitans and one for the lands of the cultures of the Middle Kingdom. It never was truly effective and it brought about more instability than prosperity, but we see it as a model that can be built off of. A sort of composite administration that seeks out to govern various geographic areas evenly and with locals in positions of power could serve us well in developing a more robust administration."
 rethinking_the_status_of_women: "Women of the Later Liao"
 rethinking_the_status_of_women_desc: "Unlike how the Middle Kingdom thinks of women in society, the Khitan people of old as well as us today think of women in a much different light. We value their contribution to society to a much greater degree and they have more autonomy in our society as compared with some stricter parts of the Middle Kingdom. In time we should work toward spreading this more equal idea for men and women throughout society, though understandably that will take many generations to do."

He excelled in statecraft, was a mathematician, astronomer, botanist, diplomat, military general, economist, hydraulic engineer, and so many other things that even today he is still fondly remembered by many. Even his work in politics in the New Policies Group and in the Hanlin Academy is still recorded for us to look back upon, and it is with him as an example that our scholars and advisors will pursue the greatest truths in this corporeal world."
 new_wave_of_minor_major_reforms: "Overhaul and Reshape the Government"
 new_wave_of_minor_major_reforms_desc: "Politics and administration were the main component of the Song Dynasty of old and the various waves of political reforms shows us just how dedicated they were to keeping things cogent in the face of political rivalries and military threats. The Qingli Reforms (or 'Minor Reforms') that were implemented from 1043 to 1045 and the New Policies (or 'Major Reforms') that were implemented from 1069 to 1076 ensured two things: administrative competency throughout the entirety of the land, and more political rivalries. Despite what rivalries we might see today, we absolutely must work to utilize reforms like the Song Dynasty of old did."

 how_the_southern_song_survived_desc: "When the Liao Dynasty of the north were vanquished by the Jurchens of the Jin Dynasty, the Song Dynasty of old was pushed back south beyond the Huai River. Despite this setback, our ancestors still managed to thrive economically thanks to putting an emphasis on trade through docks and ports. We too must realize how vital these places are to our economy and bring them to more modern standards so that our trade sector can bolster the economy even more."
 pivotal_naval_strength_of_the_song: "Dominate the Coasts and Rivers"
 pivotal_naval_strength_of_the_song_desc: "Our ancestors utilized great water vessels in the rivers and on the coasts so that they could dominate trade and conflicts at various points. Though we don't need as much river control, we do need a great amount of sea control which means we will need to improve our heaviest warships with larger cannons and sturdier hulls."

 the_military_does_not_threaten_us_desc: "In order to make sure the the administration can keep functioning smoothly, we need to be sure that the military of all things does not rise up against us in any capacity.

 learn_from_the_sui_founding_desc: "The Sui Dynasty of old was founded as a sort of insurgency. Yang Jian (who would later become known as Emperor Wen of Sui) was originally to be the regent of the Northern Zhou court which was ruled by ethnically Xianbei people, but instead of continuing things as per usual, he usurped power and founded his own dynasty that helped push back against the Xianbei. We should be watchful and careful about who steps into our court and who is close to our royal family as we would rather not be subjected to the plans of another Yang Jian."
 costly_wars_against_the_cham: "Learn from the Cham Conflicts"
 costly_wars_against_the_cham_desc: "When our ancestral Sui Dynasty held power, they sought out not only land in the east, but also land in the south. These conflicts in the south were particularly brutal at times as the Cham and Viet people proved to be much stronger than previously imagined. We should learn from these incursions southward and equip our military with better provisions and materials when they are out on campaigns."
 buddhist_influences_entrenched: "Embrace Buddhist Influences"
 buddhist_influences_entrenched_desc: "The Northern and Southern Dynasties period saw a great influx of Buddhist teachings, people, and art as local Buddhist schools in the lands of the Middle Kingdom started to flourish. The Sui Dynasty of old helped bring life to this growing Buddhist movement inside the Middle Kingdom and we are heirs to this legacy. By coming to terms with the various schools of Buddhist thought embracing the Buddhist people in our lands without turning them away, we will be able to ease some tensions in our growing population."
 revive_the_army_that_invaded_east: "Revive the Fateful Army"
 revive_the_army_that_invaded_east_desc: "The Goguryeo-Sui Wars, the fated wars that helped end our ancestral dynasty, are full of lessons to be learned by our scholars and royal family. As we learn from them though, we must keep in mind that the power the Sui Dynasty held at that point effectively culminated in a grand army and navy that few had ever seen before. It is time we revive this grand army and field more troops than ever before, for we know that we can succeed where our ancestors failed."
 not_to_over_extend_our_economy: "Later Sui Economics"
 not_to_over_extend_our_economy_desc: "What helped lead to the downfall of our ancestors was the disregard and over exertion of the economy at the time in order to fund the unsuccessful wars against Goguryeo. If we are to ever become a cogent and stable state that can fund massive construction projects and decent military, we must first look to our economics and focus our efforts on proving that we can take care of our own finances."

 the_heat_of_northern_weis_founding_desc: "The Northern and Southern Dynasties period was chaotic for a great many people in the Middle Kingdom, but the Northern Wei brought a sense of stability to the north. The foundation they stood upon was carved by blades from all sides and as such it was made strong enough to withstand for several decades. Not only this, but it was strong enough to exert military potential outward during this tumultuous period, a trait we should strive to live up to."
 buddhism_of_the_northern_wei: "Buddhism of the Northern Wei"
 buddhism_of_the_northern_wei_desc: "During this period of when the Northern Wei rulers carved out a place for themselves in the world, Buddhism was spreading throughout the lands of the north. Northern Wei rulers converted to Buddhism and were great patrons of the various Buddhist sects, bringing together a great many people under their banner. It would be wise for us to patronize Buddhism just as our ancestral dynasty did so that we too can feel the benefit of having people flock to our banners."
 address_hostility_between_the_two_people: "The Hostility of our People"
 address_hostility_between_the_two_people_desc: "As many in the Middle Kingdom think and see, there are two distinct groups of people: the steppe nomads and the settled citizens; eternally hostile and eternally suspicious of each other. If we are to survive longer than our ancestral dynasty did, we need to work on mending these differences between settled people and nomadic people so that conflicts do not break out between our own internal provinces and groups of people."
 honor_the_warriors_of_our_land: "Respect for our Fighters"
 honor_the_warriors_of_our_land_desc: "If we do not respect and pay those who put their lives on the line to protect our state from harm, then we will collapse and be but another dynasty in books for the future. As time goes on we will ensure that soldiers serving us are paid regularly and honored with proper respect during and after their service so as to keep every part of our military running smoothly."

 the_developing_frontiers_desc: "Though our frontiers are behind in development compared to our heartland, we still care for our frontiers via building outposts and small settlements throughout so that they are not completely left to the elements.

 tattered_history_of_our_name_desc: "There have been several instances of the name 'Zhao' being applied to states that rebelled and tried to make themselves something of a true dynasty for the whole of the Middle Kingdom, but each time the name Zhao surfaced to be seen, it was snuffed out by a larger foe. Now that we have chosen to take up the Zhao name and bring honor and respect back to it, we will work to instill righteous authority and proper laws throughout the land so that we do not fall so easily to external hostilities when they come knocking."
 adaptives_form_of_fighting: "The Discipline of Adaptation"
 adaptives_form_of_fighting_desc: "If there is one characteristic the old Zhao states had in common, it was trying to adapt to their surroundings so that they could survive the political and diplomatic climate around them. Though their efforts did not ultimately do much, we can still glean lessons from these failed attempts and discipline our own soldiers in adaptive forms of warfare like the various Zhao states of the past did. That way we can hold our own in future wars that come to the borders of the Middle Kingdom."
 realize_our_potential_han_zhao: "Realize our Potential"
 realize_our_potential_han_zhao_desc: "The rulers of Han Zhao (304 to 319 and 319 to 329) were astute and intelligent as many records indicate, but they were incompetent to the point of bringing their own state to ruin. There was potential in their state as many of our scholars now recognize, and just like them there is a great amount of potential in our own state, but we must learn from the mistakes of the Han Zhao and bring about a more cultivated administration that knows what moderation means, especially in times of war (since many rulers of Han Zhao were known to be cruel in times of war)."

 reform_the_court_later_zhao_desc: "The Later Zhao (319 to 351) that defeated the state of Han Zhao by capturing Liu Yao in 329 was filled with political intrigue and unstable court rivalries. This ultimately led to the downfall of the Later Zhao and its annexation which leads us to our own court today: What can we do to stabilize it? Focusing on working with rival court factions and utilizing multiple points of view on certain situations could alleviate some stress on the Zhao administration, we just need to be careful about how we go about this."

 eternal_peace_with_the_zhao_desc: "Bringing about a new age to the entirety of the Middle Kingdom is no easy task, but we of the Zhao Dyansty have proven ourselves worthy of doing just that. We are focused on our people and providing what they need when they need it. Bolstering urban growth and ensuring that each of these large cities is defended to the best of our ability is crucial in maintaining prosperity and ensuring a bright future for us; soon enough, all of the Middle Kingdom will be at peace with the Zhao Dyansty."

 legacy_of_liu_yu_desc: "The man who started the Liu Song Dynasty of old, Liu Yu, can truly have been said to have carved out the dynasty for himself. His work as a general for the Jin Dynasty of old made sure that he had the martial talent when it was truly needed, and the fruits of his labor was that of a lasting military legacy that we today are dedicated to carrying on. Still, there is work for us to do before we can ever hope to achieve great victories like Liu Yu did."
 permanent_threats_to_our_power: "Permanent Threats"
 permanent_threats_to_our_power_desc: "Much like how the Liu Song of old had the permanent threat of the Northern Wei, we too have our own permanent threats. In order to address the threats we face, we must be ready with a military force that can outnumber anything our foes can muster whilst also supplying them with enough gunpowder, swords, spears, rations, and horses. In time we will be able to overwhelm and crush our foes so that we may know some semblance of lasting peace."
 remedy_military_shortcomings: "Do Not Lose Heart"
 remedy_military_shortcomings_desc: "Military failures were part of the reason why the Liu Song Dynasty of old fell into chaos since the Northern Wei were able to take advantage of the disunity of command going on amidst Liu Song ranks in various battles. If we can establish a solid chain of command and have clear communication networks when campaigns begin, our troops will never lose heart in battle and have confidence that the leaders of the military know exactly what they are doing."
 weeds_in_the_royal_dynasty: "Settle the Royal Feuds"
 weeds_in_the_royal_dynasty_desc: "Another reason why the Liu Song Dynasty of old crumbled was the constant atmosphere of political schemes and feuds between various prominent members. This led to assassinations of key figures and disunity across the entirety of the land, something we would do well to avoid by making sure any issues in the royal family are settled either by family members or in legal courts. We cannot risk breaking up due to internal feuds between various parts of the royal family."

 poets_and_scholars_of_chaos_desc: "Even though our ancestral dynasty never was in the best of shape, poets and scholars still thrived across the land. They created poetry, art, and studied the stars above whilst the fires of war and the daggers of intrigue swept across the land; who is to say that our own scholars and artisans can't thrive in tense times too? All it takes is ensuring them some safety and keeping internal revolts from happening."

All three played pivotal roles in the development of Tamilakam into a thriving region full of trade, prosperity, and culture, though all three also contributed to many great conflicts that occurred in the region. Now that the region is united once more, we may set out with the backing of our own people and the blessing of our ancestors."
 chera_spice_trade_connections: "Spice Trade Connections"
 chera_spice_trade_connections_desc: "The Chera, though first to decline out of the three powers, was in large part the spice trading power of the three. Once holding power in the coastal area of Kerala, they thrived off incoming traders from the north and west since they all desired the wondrous spices produced on the coast. We'd do well to pick up where they left off without hesitation since we could always use the trade money for great things."
 chera_wootz_steel: "Legacy of Wootz Steel"
 chera_wootz_steel_desc: "Wootz Steel was a particular kind of strong steel from the lands of the Chera. Being exported almost solely by them, it was this steel that was said to be 'the finest steel in the world' by various Roman, Egyptian, Chinese, and Arab sources. Utilizing Wootz Steel today and refining it over time will give the Tamil people an undeniable edge in combat, and instructing them properly on how to use such high-quality material will be key for us."
 chola_naval_expeditions: "New Naval Expeditions"
 chola_naval_expeditions_desc: "To prepare for conquests as great as our ancestors of the Chola Empire, we must expand our fleet to sizes unmatched by our neighbors. Recruiting sailors and admirals as well as building new and improved ships will all be part of our ongoing effort to rule the waters of the vast ocean waters around us."
 chola_grand_invasions: "Grand Invasions"
 chola_grand_invasions_desc: "The legacy of the Chola Empire lies not only in naval battles and invasions from the water, but it also lies in conquest on land. They carved out an empire vast enough to stretch into the Deccan and challenged the once mighty Chalukya Empire for hegemony, meaning that we too have a duty to seek out lands throughout the heart of India."
 pandyan_surviving_and_still_fighting: "Survived the Past"
 pandyan_surviving_and_still_fighting_desc: "The Pandyas survived from ancient times until the 1400s, surging and then collapsing time after time again. Their legacy is a grand one like that of the Chola Empire, though their prowess did not lie in conquest. Their tenacity and will to survive for such a long time in the face of bleak and harrowing times is what we must learn from; a military that is ready to face such times is what we will need."
 pandyan_reassemble_the_sangams: "Reassemble the Sangams"
 pandyan_reassemble_the_sangams_desc: "The legendary Sangams (also known as 'the Academies') were gatherings of scholars under Pandya influence. Whilst the first two Sangams may be mythical at best, the Third Sangam that was seated in Madurai was established some 1850 years before Christianity emerged and gathered some 449 poets to create some of the greatest and most well remembered works of Tamil literature. As we go forth, we shall create a new Sangam and patronize Tamil literature as much as we can so that our cultural continues to thrive like never before."

 reinheitsgebot_for_our_beer: "Reinheitsgebot!"
 reinheitsgebot_for_our_beer_desc: "For far too long we have seen beer in German lands be made with a great deal of wrong and impure ingredients. While it is true that previous regulations regarding beer making have been passed at more local levels, in Austria-Bavaria there will be a much more strict enforcement of this legislation so that price competition with bakers for wheat and rye does not arise. The only ingredients allowed for beer made in our lands are as follows: water, barley, and hops."
 the_troublesome_south_and_east: "Troubles to the South and East"
 the_troublesome_south_and_east_desc: "Whilst Bavarian lands have been relatively safe inside of the Holy Roman Empire, Austrian lands have been plagued by issues with Hungarians, Turks, and Slavs of different sorts in the Balkans. These skirmishes and border conflicts to our south and east have given the military of Austria-Bavaria a fairly good understanding of how the field of battle works and it continually gives them motivation to keep the borders safe from further incursions."
 fugger_and_welsers_of_ab: "Fuggers and Welsers"
 fugger_and_welsers_of_ab_desc: "The illustriously wealthy mercantile families that are the Fuggers and Welsers know great fortune throughout Augsburg as well as other lands throughout the Holy Roman Empire, but none more so than perhaps Austria-Bavaria. If we can continue to harness their financial skills for our own affairs, Austria-Bavaria will always be ready for whatever financial mishaps come through in the future."
 navigating_hre_politics: "Navigating Holy Roman Politics"
 navigating_hre_politics_desc: "Moving through political schemes and diplomatic incidents throughout the Holy Roman Empire is not easy in the slightest, but the Austrian nobility and administration are adept at handling such matters. Bavarians may handle other duties better than Austrians, but when it comes to ensuring that diplomacy and politics are stowed away safely and without worry, Austrians are the ones to look toward."
 monpolizing_various_industries: "Monpolize German Industries"
 monpolizing_various_industries_desc: "Whether it is the copper industry, the salt industry, or even the paper-making industry, Austria-Bavaria is likely to have interests in it. German industries of various economic goods are thriving already, but we know that they could thrive even more if they were simply under better management and leadership. We shouldn't stress too much over this though, for in time we will obtain full hegemony over these economic factors and there will be less competition against us."
 discipline_of_the_grenzers: "Age of the Grenzers"
 discipline_of_the_grenzers_desc: "Keeping up with our borders is no easy task and though our military are motivated to keep it protected, new tactics and strategies that incorporate new military technology need to be developed. By shifting over to light infantry as opposed to continuing with heavy infantry will be key to Austria-Bavaria keeping up militarily, and these new Grenzers (otherwise known as 'frontiersman') will help us master new methods of doing battle."
 mastery_of_soft_power: "Master of Soft Power"
 mastery_of_soft_power_desc: "To project soft power outward and to use it to the benefit of the state is something that few in history have ever come to master. There are those few states and families that were able to thread the needles just right and get their family members and friendly courtiers into specific courts and halls to make a huge difference for one particular side. Austria-Bavaria will be exactly that kind of state, as its power not only comes from the words of its diplomats and royal family members, but also from its military that backs up every decree and action."
 attract_those_of_the_german_renaissance: "German Renaissance Attraction"
 attract_those_of_the_german_renaissance_desc: "The birth of great scholars and artists alike in the Italian Peninsula has led to a plethora of people from the Holy Roman Empire becoming inspired to bring these ideas northward over the decades. The German Renaissance, as some have called it, has thus brought great ideas and minds to Austria-Bavaria which is something that both Bavarian and Austrian courts benefit from greatly. Not only will our prestige last throughout the ages, but the ideas we espouse as well will last beyond our current generation."
 absolutist_power_means_a_standing_army: "To be Absolutist"
 absolutist_power_means_a_standing_army_desc: "The authority of the monarch is increasing as time goes on despite attempts to pull them back from this culmination of absolute authority. Though Austria-Bavaria has its own share of thoughts on Absolutism as a whole, we cannot deny that having a strong standing army is becoming a sign of a modernized and capable state. We must work on dismissing the system of feudal levies and work toward making our military something of a professional standard that can withstand foreign tactics and strategies."
 army_restructuring: "Prepared for the Next Age"
 army_restructuring_desc: "Just as Austria-Bavaria is becoming its own by slowly building up its power through diplomatic and military means, there are others out there who seek to best Austria-Bavaria in the heat of a large war for succcession or land. What then must be done? Perhaps the only thing that can be done is to restructure the military to handle these larger threats on our border whether they are French, Russian, Turkish, or some other state looking to pry off pieces of Austria-Bavaria."

Though it was hard to gain the status we currently hold and many may not like us currently, we can build up from where we are and build a solid state that listens to its people and represents them fairly."
 distinct_from_dutch_and_french: "Distinct, yet Familiar"
 distinct_from_dutch_and_french_desc: "Belgium is a mish-mash of two distinct though familiar cultures in the region the Low Countries. The Walloon people come from the lands of France whilst the Flemish people come from the Netherlands, though both have felt just how horrible things can be when the governing body if ineffective in every single way possible. Now is the time for both Flemish and Walloon to flourish into a truly charismatic and prestigous state that can stand out amongst European states as one that seeks both righteous governance and honest diplomacy."
 refusal_of_pure_despotism: "The Cracking of Monarchies"
 refusal_of_pure_despotism_desc: "Belgium's inception is something of bell ringing out all across Europe: the age of monarchs ruling with absolute power is not an age that will last forever. Some dynasties and leaders think the sun will shine on them until the end of time, but Belgium is almost living proof that the authority of despotism cannot go on forever without revolution from beneath later on. From this point on, Belgium must be a bastion of reform and compromise in its highest levels of office, even if we choose to have a monarch in power."
 shift_to_flemish_and_walloon_language: "Promote Flemish and Walloon"
 shift_to_flemish_and_walloon_language_desc: "French has been the traditional language of our court and official documents for a while now, but hanging on to the French identity through their language is only going to make Belgian politics more and more messy as time goes on. We should start shifting toward using Walloon and Flemish as the standard language of our courts so that we better represent our own people and we aren't leaning so hard on the traditions of others."
 continual_french_support: "Continual French Support"
 continual_french_support_desc: "Some of the French are eager to support us for one reason or another; perhaps it is to undermine the power of the Dutch or to gain influence further eastward. Whilst some in Belgium are suspicious of the French and their intentions, touting that they will want to annex Belgium altogether in the near future, we shouldn't be so quick to turn down French support after how far we have come. If we can build up our infrastructure and military based on French military principles, we'll be able to have an easier time fielding Belgian regiments in general."
 formulate_belgian_political_parties: "Solidify Belgian Politics"
 formulate_belgian_political_parties_desc: "The landscape of Belgium is diverse in some aspects, but also quite monotonous in other respects. Where it becomes especially interesting is in regards to political matters as the linguistic and cultural groups have drawn their rough lines all throughout Belgium already. Learning more about these groups on a person-to-person basis will allow for the formation of more stable and less violent political movements as we continue forth."
 evenly_distribute_the_burden: "The Even Burden"
 evenly_distribute_the_burden_desc: "And as we pass laws and edicts toward our diverse yet strong populous, we do so knowing that we are attempting act in their best interest at all times. Shady deals and corruption scandals may arise, but we will root out the traitors to Belgian politics as quickly as we can and maintain the great peace in our land that should always be present."
 as_thrifty_as_any_dutchmen: "Business is Business"
 as_thrifty_as_any_dutchmen_desc: "Though the Flemish may be seen by the Dutch in the Netherlands as 'lower' Dutchmen, the Flemish can do just as well with regards to trade negotiations and making a good profit. If our rivals want to compete against Belgian interests in markets around Europe and outside of Europe, then we will give them no quarter and ensure that all profits stream back to us whenever possible."
 satiate_german_and_french_minorities: "Minor Cultures of Belgium"
 satiate_german_and_french_minorities_desc: "Those who are distinctly French and German are easy to spot in Belgian land since they do not identify with Walloon or Flemish people and will make that fact known if counted in a census of any sort. These minorities should be rightfully accounted for and given some form of representation so that there is good communication between the minor groups of people in Belgium and the administration itself."
 high_level_diplomacy: "A Look in the Mirror"
 high_level_diplomacy_desc: "As we settle our internal affairs and seek out both alliances and trade treaties with states around us, we need to always be mindful of how we look to foreign powers. Is Belgium overstepping its limits? How does our military seem to foreigners near to us? These are just a couple questions our diplomats and officials should keep in mind when conducting diplomacy since it can help determine how we should be doing things inside our nation."

 IKI_ideas_bonus: "Jodo Shinshu Ambition"
 power_from_the_bottom_up: "From Humble Roots"
 power_from_the_bottom_up_desc: "The origins of the Ikko-Ikki and indeed where the Jodo Shinshu school of Buddhism comes into play are humble in origin, but it is the daimyo of the land that and the overarching militaristic style of governance that drove the Ikko-Ikki into open conflict. Granted some parts of our faith and movement preach an aggressive doctrine of salvation via faith, our origins still are more humble and enticing to a great many people and we intend to keep that image at our forefront."
 defensive_temple_towns: "Righteous in our Defense"
 defensive_temple_towns_desc: "Temples had become havens when the daimyo and Ikko-Ikki clashed both politically and militarily. Fortifying them and attracting peasants and workers who are skilled in labor practices helped make the temples into highly defensive bases of operation for the Ikko-Ikki. Even today we still see them as a defensive places for the lower classes of society should revolts break out, but we are careful to ensure that the temples never do turn against our authority."
 recruit_the_sohei: "Recruit the Sohei of our Land"
 recruit_the_sohei_desc: "Warrior monks known as sohei have been around for centuries and have proven to be crucial to the military strength of various daimyo around the land, but some are skeptical as to whether or not we should recruit them into our state. They have been enemies of the Ikko-Ikki at times, but also at other times they were friendly to the monks and peasants who fought against the unjust authority from the various lords. Perhaps now that the Jodo Shinshu school of Buddhism now has its own state, we can ensure that any sohei we recruit will not turn against us."
 listening_to_the_commoners: "Listen to the People"
 listening_to_the_commoners_desc: "Jodo Shinshu is quite different from other schools of Buddhism in the fact that, it appealed to the lower classes of Japanese society (and it still does today) thanks to not focusing on the esoteric practices normally found in, for example, Shingon and Tendai Buddhism. We carry forth this appeal to the lower classes of our own society today and regularly listen to what commoners have to say about current laws, practices, and even the politics that make their way into smaller communities."
 preach_to_the_downtrodden: "Preach to the People"
 preach_to_the_downtrodden_desc: "Upon the conquest of new land and attempting to make peace with the new people under our authority, it would benefit us to spread the messages and doctrines of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism at the level of peasants and workers. Having our monks and priests practicing the more straight-forward and less esoteric parts of traditional Buddhism and connecting them with the daily lives and labor of newly conquered people will help them embrace the Jodo Shinshu school in time."
 hail_to_buddha_amida: "Hail to Amitabha!"
 hail_to_buddha_amida_desc: "During the clashes between the Ikko-Ikki and the various daimyo of the land, some Ikko-Ikki banners had traditional nianfo (meaning repetition of the name of Amitabha) on banners to bolster the morale of their brothers-in-arms. This sort of fighting with faith as a helping force to bolster the spirits of the military is exactly what will aid our soldiers going forward into the future, and perhaps we will continue to use such nianfo chants on our banners so that all may know of our religious convictions."
 disband_the_samurai_class: "An End to the Samurai"
 disband_the_samurai_class_desc: "Samurai leaders were the bane of the Ikko-Ikki at multiple points since many sought to tear down the power of the lowly peasants and priests attempting to defend themselves from the abhorrent edicts and laws from above. The samurai that supported both the daimyo and Ikko-Ikki simply cannot be trusted to roam the lands and possibly influence politics as much as they used to; we must work to dissolve the samurai class if we are to have a stable state."

 the_courage_of_the_celts: "Enduring Courage"
 the_courage_of_the_celts_desc: "Ages upon ages have worn down the will to go on for many communities of Celtic people as the English, French, and even Norse people subjugated various Celtic communities and treated them as merely second-class citizens. Now that the tables have turned and the Celtic people are seeing renewed growth, vigor, and wealth, the courage inside that was once dimmed by foreign invaders can shine forth! We will never back down from challenges or conflicts that threaten our state or our people!"
 legacy_of_the_norse_invasions: "Norse Imprint on the Celts"
 legacy_of_the_norse_invasions_desc: "The great sailors and ruthless ravagers that were the Norse invaders from centuries ago have been culled in their efforts to subjugate these fair Isles, but the mark they left on Celtic traditions across the various lands we inhabit is undeniable. Combining our old seafaring heritage with the ambitious naval efforts engaged in by the Norse in the past centuries will yield lands never before seen by our sailors and commoners, and when others contest our naval prowess actively, we will undoubtedly send them to a watery grave."
 traditions_of_celtic_bards: "Rich Oral and Literary Tradition"
 traditions_of_celtic_bards_desc: "Tales as old as time itself run through the lands of Celtic people and this is nothing new. For centuries we have had bards and poets who memorize vast lines of dialogue in order to recite them for ceremonies later on, and since paper is becoming more and more available, these bards and poets are beginning to put their oral tales of the past into writing. In keeping this heritage of ours alive and well whilst preserving it throughout time through paper and books, we honor our fallen ancestors and help bring a sense of peace to the land of the Celts."
 resettling_celtic_lands: "Expansion of Celtic Settlements"
 resettling_celtic_lands_desc: "Despite what incursions were done against us by the English, French, and Norse people, Celtic settelements never died out and never stopped retaining their distinct identity. It is our duty now to not only protect these identities, but to ensure their safety from those groups of people within our borders who seek to still erode away Celtic languages and traditions."
 compile_celtic_laws: "Compilations and Reformations"
 compile_celtic_laws_desc: "One of the largest aspects of our state is the fact that there are varying legal systems derived from previous ones in each of the lands Celtic people occupy. Instead of hoping this mish-mash of laws keeps working without much refinement, we should take an active role in reforming these legal systems into a comprehensive system of laws and edicts that can be understood in all lands of the Celtic people. It won't be easy translating these laws into about six different languages, but it will ease the administrative burden later on."
 six_official_languages: "The Six Celtic People"
 six_official_languages_desc: "The core Celtic people groups are the following: The Irish, the Welsh, the Breton, the Manx, the Cornish, and the Scottish. Unification of these six groups has been not easy on anyone in our administration, diplomatic sector, or military, but it has been well worth the hardship. Bringing a sense of greater unity to the Celtic people and overcoming the foreign aggression consistently put toward us has led to a great number of clans and families willing to put their own lives on the line for this nation, the land of the Celts."
 from_the_brink_of_death_and_back: "Back from the Brink"
 from_the_brink_of_death_and_back_desc: "Resurgent and revived like never before, the Celtic people are now a true force to be reckoned with. No longer will the other monarchies and republics of Europe look down on any on of the Celtic people groups; instead there will be a respect that should have always been there from the beginning. Despite our best efforts to garner respect though, there are still others who think they can sufficently test their mettle against us and win, forcing us back like the English and French did in past centuries. What more can we say to these rivals of ours other than, we will never surrender."

 expand_apache_borders: "Age of the Apache"
 expand_apache_borders_desc: "The Apache people were scattered before, but now they are unified with a strong foundation grounded in tradition yet also aided by new ways of thinking and administrating. It is not enough for us to sit idly by as the land around us is taken up by these foreigners who think the world is only for them, no, we must turn these lands into our own and integrate these smaller tribes into the greater state of Apacheria. Through this expansion, we will grow stronger internally and be able to fend for ourselves in this new age."
 give_it_all_for_apacheria: "We Give It All"
 give_it_all_for_apacheria_desc: "If it was not diseases that struck down the Apache people before when the foreign marauders arrived, it was the skirmishes and conflicts they engaged in with our people. Though the enemy may think that Apacheria is nothing more than a small gathering of Apache people who barely know how to govern, we will show them that we are ready to give our all to the cause of defending Apache lands from foreign aggression and foreign interests. Many of these foreign folks simply do not seek just normal trade relations and diplomacy with us; they seek to conquer us by force. Let us give them a proper response paid in blood."
 apache_rifle_riders: "Riding with Rifles Ready"
 apache_rifle_riders_desc: "The black powder muskets and other similar rifles are becoming more useful as time goes on and Apache kin groups all across our land are integrating firearms into their ways of life as time goes on. Utilizing these firearms on horseback has also allowed Apache people both experienced and inexperienced to be able to raid and deal great amounts of hit-and-run damage against enemy forces, meaning that the method of fighting is becoming increasingly popular. In these open lands that make up the heart of Apacheria, we should recruit more of these 'rifle riders' and make them a signature part of our military so that we can best our enemies in open combat."
 manage_our_internal_ecosystem: "Know the Shifting Land"
 manage_our_internal_ecosystem_desc: "We still have some nomadic Apache people in our land, but many are taking to settled life as the decades go by. This means that we are seeing changes in both society and the ecosystems we rely on, the latter of which we need to keep in especially careful check. By planning out what crops we should be planting, what animals we should be hunting, and how much of the land we use up for our own needs, we can keep several parts of our land fertile for both animals and plants alike. In respecting nature and what it provides, Apacheria will see a more robust economy build up inside itself."
 mobile_apache_cannons: "Mobility in Apache Ranks"
 mobile_apache_cannons_desc: "The vast stretches of land in Apacheria mean that logistics and mobility are key issues we strive to address. Dirt paths and gravel roads are not exactly the best way of going about marking the paths in our land, but we can build upon these over time and have our military practice communicating and moving along these routes so that they know exactly where to go when the time comes. If we cannot be mobile with even our own cavalry and horse-drawn siege equipment, how are we to survive when enemies invade from multiple sides?"
 infantry_and_cavalry_skirmishes: "Flexibility in Apache Tactics"
 infantry_and_cavalry_skirmishes_desc: "On top of being mobile, Apache fighters both on horseback and on the ground need to be able to work together in a variety of situations. Training them to work together and to work in formations where the cavalry lead the way will certainly aid Apacheria when it faces off against enemies in the open plains and arid drylands. In time, we will be unmatched in cavalry strength and military might in all of the Great Plains!"
 killer_of_enemies_and_child_of_the_water: "Killer of Enemies; Child of the Water"
 killer_of_enemies_and_child_of_the_water_desc: "Apache traditions stretch back many generations as our ancestors passed along oral stories of great heroes and various deities, but two of the most prominent are as follows: One of the Sun named 'Killer of Enemies', and one of the moon named 'Child of the Water'. Both of these grand heroes of legend embody a number of traits which many Apache people strive for and stand as beings who help dash down creatures harmful to humanity. In striving for these righteous traits, we, and especially our leader, become stronger with time and more at peace with our past."

 engage_in_greater_cooperation_desc: "We have had a very long history cooperating with the Pueblo people nearby, and it is partly through the cooperation between us that we have grown to be as significant as we are. Though violence is to be had when feuds erupt past fierce diplomacy, all of our core people no matter their clan have learned to take a cooperative stance toward other people groups around us as we expand outward."
 mutual_understanding_and_kinship: "Through Helping, there is Hope"
 mutual_understanding_and_kinship_desc: "Engaging in diplomatic talks on both communal and high levels with other groups of people is key to ensuring that Dinétah stays internally sound in its politics. We know just how quickly feuds between clans can flare up and cause tensions that stretch from horizon to horizon, and this is exactly what we are aiming to prevent by hosting diplomatic councils of sorts. Special hogans can be built for these talks as well since hogans have been the traditional homes our ancestors lived in since as long as we can remember."
 navajo_farmlands_extended: "More than the Three Sisters"
 navajo_farmlands_extended_desc: "Traditionally, we have grown crops in what are known as 'Three Sisters Fields', which grew mainly corn, beans, and squash. These sustianed our ancestors for as long as they lived, but our encounters with new people from far off lands that bring to our region new crops of all kinds means that our fields are no longer capable of just growing three traditional crops. Utilizing them in more efficient ways and growing a more diverse set of crops all across Dinétah will help provide all of our people with food to eat and store away."
 the_fearing_time_is_over: "The Fearing Time is Over"
 the_fearing_time_is_over_desc: "When those foreign folks came to Dinétah and encountered our people, there was fear and tension throughout all involved. They could outdo us in combat and could very well subjugate us through force if they wanted, but the events that unfolded favored our people over the foreigners. Skirmishes and minor conflicts that might have instilled fear in our people at first have hardened us as a whole; we no longer have to fear what the strangers might do to us, for the time to fear is over." 
 new_production_ways_and_new_ethnobotany: "Production and Ethnobotany, Refined"
 new_production_ways_and_new_ethnobotany_desc: "For many generations we have used what the land beneath our feet has offered up, season after season and generation after generation. Whether it was in the form of certain medicinal and resource-laden plants or in the form livestock brought to this land by the strangers from across the water, Dinétah is home to a great many animals and plants for us to use. Not only this, but improving our understanding through new investigative and resource-gathering techniques will only help Dinétah be more productive for all inside its borders."
 matrilineal_system_and_cant_live_without_eachother: "We Can't Live Alone"
 matrilineal_system_and_cant_live_without_eachother_desc: "The way we have done inheritance and the division between both male and female is strange in the eyes of the newcomers from across the water, but it has and still continues to serve as a strong basis for ensuring stability in Dinétah. The women of our nation own the majority of things like livestock, dwellings, planting areas, etc. and they inherit property during generation transitions whilst also keeping the man as a significant stakeholder in clan politics. This helps reflect the nature of our culture that we have had for untold amounts of time now, that nature eluding to the fact that men and women are seen as contemporary equals."
 unmatched_artistic_crafts: "Artistic Prowess"
 unmatched_artistic_crafts_desc: "The weaving and smithing of Dinétah is well known across the vast swaths of land around us. Not only are our crafts functional when they need to be, but they are clearly made with precision and care to the point where a great many woven blankets, overalls, and rugs are seen as works of art. Though our silver and goldsmiths are just getting started, they too are already showing artistic promise as they help build up our core culture throughout the ages."

 rightful_claims_of_comancheria_desc: "Tribal politics are shifting all around us, and old ties between various people groups are breaking due to technological imbalances and new ideas floating about. Comanche people are no stranger to this and are keen on taking advantage of these breaks in old ties when it is possible. The might of one's own people makes them the rightful owner of the lands here, does it not? Comanche people and others in the plains cannot sustain themselves with simple spears and bows when enemies come through with muskets and horses."
 the_lord_of_the_plains_forever_more: "Forever the Lords of the Plains"
 the_lord_of_the_plains_forever_more_desc: "Horses have forever changed how Comanche people and indeed other people around us look at warfare as a whole. No longer are we limited to moving on foot for skirmishes, and with the help of gunpowder weapons, we are no longer limited to simply using traditional bows and spears on horseback. Unlike others however, the Comanche have emphasized using the horse in warfare much more since they have been introduced to us, and since Comancheria can fund a stable military sector, equipping our cavalry with muskets will make them even deadlier. If anyone can keep the title of the 'Lords of the Plains', it is us."
 outposts_across_the_plains: "Vast Lands Require Security"
 outposts_across_the_plains_desc: "Comancheria is not without its empty parts since it rules over vast domains of land that stretch on from horizon to horizon. Bandits and criminals are ready to hide out in these open stretches of land and that means if enemies get through to them, there is almost nothing stopping them from moving around inside of Comancheria. That is where outposts and small settlements come into play; they can help lock down Comancheria and give a greater sense of security to Comanche people in general whilst also halting the advance of incoming invasions."
 well_managed_hunting: "Well Managed Hunting"
 well_managed_hunting_desc: "Hunting bison and other wildlife has been integral to the way of life of our ancestors, but is it what Comancheria will thrive on? In large part no, but hunting serves ritualistic and ceremonial purposes for Comanche people as well as others around us, and if we hunt all the animals we can find into extinction, the societal impacts will be undoubtedly terrible. Thus, we must take it upon ourselves to manage how much we hunt so as to leave enough for nature; it will benefit it later on if we can keep the balance of our people and nature even."
 unmatched_horsemanship: "Comanche Horsemanship"
 unmatched_horsemanship_desc: "Whilst we are fond of fighting on horseback and using skirmishing tactics against our foes whenever possible, we can't forget the seeds of this cavalry-oriented military of ours: Horsemanship! Cultivating a stronger and more robust base of farmers and ranchers who can raise horses that are suitable for Comancheria is what will be needed in the future, and as we get more and more horses over time, we will integrate them into our military as a whole so that we do not rely solely on men running from place to place."
 melt_into_the_plains_and_then_counter: "Melt Away, then Ambush Again!"
 melt_into_the_plains_and_then_counter_desc: "The brilliant part about emphasizing cavalry tactics in accordance to the landscape of Comancheria is that, we know exactly how to retreat and then strike again from out of nowhere. Enemies, especially those not familiar with the land, will find it shocking to see just how fast we can move away from them if things look bad at first, and then that shock will turn to dread as we strike later on with even more power and might when they least expect it. This counter-attack strategy will require effort on our part to mastery, but it will deny our enemy of a number of advantages later on."
 reformation_of_comanche_bands: "Reformation of Kinship"
 reformation_of_comanche_bands_desc: "Throughout our history, the Comanche never had a very unified identity or political system. The traditional divisions in Comanche kinship made it so that the related Comanche bands acted quite independently of each other, but as Comancheria takes shape across the vast swaths of land it encompasses, this independent mentality must be reshaped to fit the building of a stronger and more centralized administration. Through this collective reshaping of old kinship ties, we can stand together as a united people against any foreign invasion."

 encompassing_wider_kin_groups_desc: "Scattered across the vast lands around us are groups of people who sometimes speak similar languages to us, yet they do not recognize our authority and what we have to offer. As we of Selis-Qlispe expand outward and meet these groups of people our ancestors had contact with, we will negotiate their entrance into our nation formally and ensure that they're welcomed with open arms. Despite what past grievances we may have with each other, we can and must be ready to look past them or settle them through peaceful methods."
 fur_trade_of_the_northwest: "Capitalize on the Fur Trade"
 fur_trade_of_the_northwest_desc: "The foreigners who come to our shores are often in search of furs and pelts, which is good for business and making profits in Selis-Qlispe but it is not purely a good thing. These alluring profits will often attract rogue and independent merchants to sail to our land to establish trading posts or forts to sustain their own fur trading business, undermining what we are trying to keep as our own. We must continuously work to fend off these petty foes of ours and ensure that throughout our land, the fur trade is ours and ours alone."
 reorganized_housing_and_property: "Organize Housing and Property"
 reorganized_housing_and_property_desc: "With the coming of foreigners to our shores comes the fact that new ways and ideas on property and land organization are becoming a reality. We cannot always do things as our ancestors did with regards to organizing the land as we cannot stop the influx of foreigners who trade and sometimes settle in our land; these ideas on land reform will thus continue to make their way into Selis-Qlispe's administration. If we work with these ideas, however, and attempt to develop a strong sense of how the land can be developed, settled, and worked over time, we will be all the more prosperous in the future."
 the_art_of_a_diverse_nation: "Art and History, Intertwined"
 the_art_of_a_diverse_nation_desc: "It is crucial to keep our past history alive through oral tradition, and also the art produced by our people in constant circulation. The joining of more groups of people into the Selis-Qlispe nation means that our history can intermingle and converse with other histories, and our art can do just the same with new types of art brought into our fold. All of this is to say that, the culture cultivated inside Selis-Qlispe is something of a beautiful and animated thing, more than just a single idea and more than just a few shades of color; it is living, moving, breathing, and making each day into something to remember."
 canoe_and_forest_combatants: "Evolution of our Combat"
 canoe_and_forest_combatants_desc: "Combat in our land has traditionally been akin to skirmishes with spears, bows-and-arrows, and basic clubs; they never were truly pitched battles. The introduction of firearms has led to great power changes all across the land we know of, however, and we are no exception to this. Our traditional combat in canoes along the coasts and rivers, and our fighting in both forests and fields alike, they all are evolving with muskets replacing the weapons of old. If we can readily embrace them as a whole and perhaps look to start producing them locally, then we will be one step closer to being the dominant power throughout our homeland."
 keep_the_potlach_feast: "The Potlatch Feast"
 keep_the_potlach_feast_desc: "Celebrated on births, deaths, adoptions, weddings, and other major events, the potlatch feast helps make up for past grievances, settle disputes, and distribute a variety of reources. Gifts during a potlatch feast would include storable food, canoes, slaves, and decorative items like beads, and all of this contributes to helping maintain social cohesion and order within our society." 
 unmatched_terrain_experience: "Ancestral Terrain"
 unmatched_terrain_experience_desc: "To most outsiders, this land of flowing rivers, dense forests, great rains, and high up mountains is something to be conquered and subjugated by settlements. They do not respect what it has to offer and will work to mitigate the harshness of the terrain when and where possible, something we simply do not go along with. The fighters of Selis-Qlispe know how to utilize the terrain for training and regular combat purposes, turning pitched battles into routes or skirmishes into full on assaults due to the fact that they can navigate forests and hills with more ease than foreigners. Few if any can match our prowess in this regard."

 the_abode_of_clouds: "The Abode of Clouds"
 the_abode_of_clouds_desc: "Where we come from, clouds meet high up villages and towns and the moisture in the air is thick throughout most of the year. To add to this, the hills are steep, the terrain is rough, and the flor and fauna make moving through our homeland a nightmare to most foreign people. This kind of environment has shaped all of us in Meghalaya's heartland to be better and stronger, and we will show those who dare invade our lands exactly the strength we have built up over generations."
 islamic_invasions_and_islamic_ideas: "Islam's Influence"
 islamic_invasions_and_islamic_ideas_desc: "We cannot deny just how influential Islam has been in our land and in the history of the various states that came before Meghalaya. The Delhi Sultanate and the Bengal Sultanate propagated Islam's spread and it mixed together with tribal beliefs, Hindu traditions, and even some Buddhist ideas here and there throughout the lands we call home. Now we can say with certainty that Islam has helped open new topics of discussion in our schools and courts, and with its innovative ideas flowing throughout, we can do more as a cohesive state."

 untold_amounts_of_diversity_desc: "Vast are the hills and highlands of Meghalaya, are they not? Filled with people hailing from different traditions and languages, they all contribute their fair share to our internal wealth and prosperity but do not always feel as though they are appreciated as such. Whether they are the Khasi people, the Nagas, the Garo people, the Pnar people, or even more populous groups like the Bengali people or the Nepali people, they will be accepted into Meghalaya and listend to by officials both locally and at the highest echelons of power. If Meghalaya cannot recognize the parts that make up its foundations, it will collapse beneath the clouds."
 adaptation_to_tropical_agriculture: "Predict the Monsoons; Predict our Future"
 adaptation_to_tropical_agriculture_desc: "We are vulnerable to what the weather brings us, and what we are brought most of the time is... Rain. Lots and lots of rain. The rain does not come in even showers though, as sometimes monsoons come through and drench our homeland in water, causing rivers to flood and farmlands to be submerged completely; other times monsoons fail and we are stuck with lower-than-average river levels and thus worse crop yields. We need to be able to adapt our agriculture to these possible changes through better tools for flood control and farming overall for, if we can manage this, we can make our future all the more prosperous."
 the_wettest_homeland_on_earth: "The Wettest Homeland"
 the_wettest_homeland_on_earth_desc: "Even during seasons where we lack monsoon rains, our homeland still remains the wettest in the entire world. The ground will turn to mud at times and movement will be tough, but this kind of uneven and harsh terrain is exactly what our military needs to in order to train properly. Unpredictable circumstances happen during times of war and being prepared to move across whatever ground is beneath will ensure that Meghalaya's armies are never caught out."
 multi_faced_meghalaya_military: "Multi-Faced Meghalaya"
 multi_faced_meghalaya_military_desc: "Just as we listen to our many people on the local level and bring their needs to the administration, they will pledge their service to Meghalaya's defense. We cannot let petty inter-tribal or inter-cultural feuds divide up our own regiments, rather we must work to ascend our people past these local disputes so that they can cooperate more easily. Disputes should be resolved in our courts, not on a field of battle made out of Meghalaya itself."
 celebrate_like_no_other: "Celebrate Your Culture!"
 celebrate_like_no_other_desc: "None doubt the fact that we are numerous in the languages we speak and the festivals we celebrate. Bengali people do not celebrate the same festivals as the Khasi people, but what do we of Meghalaya do? Help them celebrate together! It does not matter what language you speak or what faith you follow, we are always keen on helping our own people find common ground through dances, songs, poetry, and even elaborate costume designs. We are not going to outlaw certain festivals that are foreign to us, we simply need to see how the festival can be incorporated into the wider plethora of good times that are had all throughout Meghalaya."

 the_differences_in_berber_beliefs_desc: "Berber people are spread across so many regions and so many landscapes that it should not surprise anyone that these different groupings of Berber people have interpreted the idea of religion differently, and subsequently what constitutes religious beliefs and rituals as a whole. We must not seek to whip these Berber groups into a single line of religious thinking, that will only lead to the breaking up of our state along religious lines; instead we need to be open to accepting and understanding how these different interpretations can contribute to our progress toward the future."
 respect_for_confederacies: "Respect the Historic Confederacies"
 respect_for_confederacies_desc: "For generations we have seen confederacies of Berbers rise and fall from power. Some gave rise to powerful states in the past, whilst others aided the conquests of other states spread across North Africa. What this all means to us, the leaders of Tamazagha, is that we must respect the history of our vast array of kin, and we must also work to foster good relations between the Berber confederacies that we rule over to this day. They don't hold absolute power over Tamazagha, but they hold enough power to make their voices heard and actions felt if they do not like something the administration does."
 mutual_understanding_with_arabs: "Come to Peace with Arabs"
 mutual_understanding_with_arabs_desc: "Arabs have been a constant in North Africa for many centuries now, but still we recognize that there are clear differences between Berbers and Arabs. Whilst not all differences can be mended between our two distinct cultures, we can work toward cooperating with them as we have throughout previous generations, earning the trust and respect of influential Arab families spread across our land. Perhaps in time, we can see a sort of cultural blending between Berbers and Arabs beyond the commonality of religion alone."
 camel_warfare_across_tamazagha: "Reliance on Camel Warfare"
 camel_warfare_across_tamazagha_desc: "'Ships of the desert', as some folks call the trusty camel. Indeed they have served people who dwelled in hot climates like North Africa, the Sahara, and the Arabian Peninsula, but it is perhaps in the land we reside in where camel warfare is at its height. Even with the introduction of muskets and more advanced cavalry tactics meant for horses, camels continue to be what is ideal for those of North Africa. We'll readily adapt ourselves to the coming technological innovations with gunpowder and such, but camel combat is something we cannot abandon."
 open_to_more_egalitarian_measures: "Different Views on Men and Women"
 open_to_more_egalitarian_measures_desc: "Islam has its more orthodox adherents who do things by the book and by what muftis and those of the ulema dictate, this is well known. Islam also has its habit of melding with traditional beliefs of a region it comes to so that it is more easily taken up by local people, and this is exactly what some Berber groups have done over the centuries. Our view on where men and women belong in society is not quite what Sunni, Shiite, or Ibadi Islam dictates, and our more tolerant outlook on religious views as a whole is what will help us mend our own views on roles in society with what Islam prescribes."
 regular_crossing_of_saharan_trade: "Holders of Cross-Saharan Trade"
 regular_crossing_of_saharan_trade_desc: "Trade across the Sahara has been around for centuries, much like the Berber people themselves, and as such it has led to several Berber confederacies thriving off of the wealth brought from south to north and vice versa. Taking full authority over the trade routes and keeping the trade routes safe from raiders and brigands will help ensure stability in the trade sector, thus leading to higher income margins for Tamazagha as a whole."
 modernized_ksars: "Age-Old Ksars, Reformed"
 modernized_ksars_desc: "Ah the ksar, stemming from the Maghrebi Arabic term 'qasar' meaning 'castle' or 'palace'. Long has it been a staple of Berber villages and settlements, fortified through cut stone and and mudbricks to be safe and secure. Usually housing a mosque, a bath, ovens, and even shops, these fortified villages have been aided by the presence of oases and the consistent agadir, or, fortified granary by which the ksar sustains itself, but the ksars are not a permanent solution. We must work toward reforming how they are built and what they are built out of so that they can become stronger and tougher centers of Berber life, culture, and resistance for if any invader dares come through."

Trade routes, invasion routes, and important island bases are found within this great sea, which is exactly why we must muster what naval forces we have in order to control it all. Should our naval efforts fail to secure us the Aegean Sea, the entire empire could fall into the hands of our enemies."

 frontier_against_islam_desc: "Ever since the Turks invaded through the faulty Byzantine defenses and lackluster Byzantine forces, the entirety of Christendom has been under threat from the east and south. That is where the righteous Catholic nobles from the west come through to correct what was done wrong under the Byzantines, and though our efforts were thwarted in the past by the Empire of Nicaea, our resurgent empire will ensure that the tide of Islam can be pushed back through the dynastic alliances of western Catholics and the stalwart religious vigor imbued within them."
 northern_and_southern_threats: "From the North! And from the South!"
 northern_and_southern_threats_desc: "Traditional enemies of the old Latin Empire from the 1200s were few in number politically, but they were strong enough to deal harsh blows to the empire over the course of about 60 years. Thus, it is our duty to learn from these old threats and examine how we can deal with new threats on our frontiers since not all Christians will abide by what our demolishing of Byzantine authority nor our growing power in the southeast of Europe."
 establishing_formal_latinokratia: "Latinokratia, in Full"
 establishing_formal_latinokratia_desc: "Rule of the Latins is what 'Latinokratia' roughly means and it is exactly what the Latin Empire will put into place as time goes on. Whilst we do appreciate what the old Byzantine administration did, Catholic rule necessitates Catholic changes across the entire spectrum of administrative matters. And considering that our legacy of crusading has an inherent military tint to it, securing more authority across our empire will be easier as time goes on."

 uphold_catholic_prelates_and_archbishop_desc: "The Eastern Orthodox clergy are not completely broken, but they are also not on the same level of power that they used to be what with our empire being as resurgent as it is. The Papacy is greatly pleased with how Catholicism is making its way toward eastern lands and we are working to ensure that the true and proper word of God is spread to the lands we've conquered in earnest. These lands will be organized according to Catholic-oriented doctrine and traditions, for the old Eastern Orthodox ones may now be relegated to the annals of history."

 out_of_greek_bureaucracy_and_to_a_new_form_desc: "The old systems are slowly being chipped away at and reworked to having a Catholic and Latin feel to them. Whether it is in collecting taxes or trading in various resources, the Latin Empire is transforming how the communities of Greeks served the administration so that they are more in line with Latin prospects. All of this, of course, is being aided by faithful Catholic allies in the west and Papal emissaries who wish to bolster our progress as a whole."

 legacy_of_the_crusaders_founding_desc: "The mess that was the Fourth Crusade in 1202-1204 rocked the entirety of Christendom since it involved so many influential people and states. In the ashes that fell down from the burning Byzantine cities and fortifications, the Latin Empire rose up and established itself alongside other crusader states, and of course the bastard state of Nicaea. This crusading foundation of our past is something that is not always shrouded in the best light, but it gives our leaders and soldiers a courageous and militant legacy to live up to. We certainly will strive to do, only, next time serving for a clear purpose and without international politics getting in the way."

 in_unity_we_exude_power_desc: "We have attained a status that many tribes and groups around us have not: unity! It is a simple concept to some, but to many it is something that is rare and hard to come by. This unity of ours exudes power and strength not only in numbers, but in diplomatic places as well since others around us will begin to take notice of our united confederacy and perhap wish to join in time. We can only encourage such action after it is affirmed by the Haudenosaunee Council."
 long_house_deliberation: "The Clan Mother & The Longhouse"
 long_house_deliberation_desc: "We are very much a Matriarchal in nature as the Clan Mother is what decides politics inside each longhouse. Now, longhouses can easily come to encompass hundreds of members and as such, clan mothers can easily appoint and retract chiefs appointed to positions of power (Civil, War, Peace Chief, and Sachem). On top of this, our society is stringent in its organization in that: about two longhouses will generally make up a clan; four clans will make up moiety; and two moietys will make up a 'nation' in our confederacy. Through this and our politics, the Haudenosaunee Council where the appointed Sachems meet is where the intensive and exhaustive deliberation takes place. We are all part of the same longhouse; let us govern ourselves as such."

 distribution_and_respect_for_power_desc: "Through our growing pains and formative years in prior generations, we have come to recognize who is who in our grand longhouse that encompasses the various nations of our confederacy. Some nations are seen as older siblings, some as younger siblings, and some are somewhere in the middle. No matter where they are though, they get their fair share of deliberation in the Haudenosaunee Council and their power inside our confederacy is respected. Such is our tradition, and as such it will continue to be throughout time as we welcome new siblings into our longhouse."

 the_need_to_command_the_fur_trade_desc: "Whilst our politics may be robust and refined, the matter of trade and our internal economy is a different matter. The more the foreigners from the east come to these lands near us to trade and build up new communities, the more we come into contact with them with regards to trading resources. We must obtain the upper hand in this respect against other competing tribes since there will undoubtedly be lucrative trade deals and bonuses to revenue that we can acquire if we are fast enough. Our strategic location next to the Great Lakes should also be something we use to our advantage."

 the_covenant_chain_of_assimilation_desc: "The Great Law of Peace dictates many things for our people and the various nations in our confederacy, but one thing it does not permit is the wholesale slaughter of conquered people. We must instead look to the Covenant Chain part of our Great Law of Peace wherein it encourages us to assimilate and accept subject people into our fold.

It is not an easy mentality to learn and perfect, but seasoned hunters and warriors of our confederacy can implement it to a great degree. This mentality must in due time carry over to the large battles we will face with our neighbors since we do not have the manpower to rely on in comparison.

 many_governments_but_one_authority_desc: "Ranging from the Tsars of Bulgaria to the Bans of Croatia and Bosnia and even toward the despots of Serbia, the various people of Illyria have known many governing bodies over the course of their history. South Slavic people have never stood truly united under one administration and to this day, we struggle sometimes in organizing Illyrian finances and projects because of the strongly rooted identities of each group. But where we have succeeded is in cultivating a much more formalized system of multiple smaller governments set across the territories we control, all under one strongly bureaucratic administration that seeks to overcome the differences from each South Slavic subgroup."

 in_brotherhood_as_we_are_in_statehood_desc: "The bonds that we have and are continuing to forge as we continue building up Illyria are bonds that no mere invasion or rebellion can break apart. The brotherhood between Croatians, Bosnians, Serbians, Bulgarians, Slovenes, and Montenegrins grows stronger by the month as they all work together to help propel Illyria not only to international prominence, but also unprecedented unity across the Balkans. To defend this unity and to serve Illyria so that the South Slavs may never be divided up again by foreign powers, that is where true honor and glory rests, and all Illyrians know that as a fact."

 adriatic_hostilities: "Turn Back the Doge"
 adriatic_hostilities_desc: "If there has been one pest to our west that we could not truly root out through diplomacy or warfare, it has been Venice. For centuries they have made the Adriatic their home and have dominated not only trade routes flowing in and out of the Adriatic, but they have routinely sought to conquer coastal areas for their own benefit. Whether it was in the lands of the Greeks down south or in the lands of the Croatians or Serbians, they expanded without end seemingly over the course of history, but we of Illyria are ready to put a stop to it. If we can use the Croatian positions strategically close to Venetian lands, than we can craft a navy that might just be able to contest for control of the Adriatic Sea."

 remember_the_twelve_noble_croatian_tribes_desc: "For a long while, the Twelve Noble Tribes of Croatia have served to cement Croatian influence wherever the Croatian state spread, but now that Illyria is at hand, what shall we do with them? It would be wise of us to not simply let them do whatever they please, but it would also not be wise to let them enforce Croatian dominance across Illyria (angering other South Slavs should not be our goal). Instead, we should have them in vital positions of governance yet equal in power to Serbia, Bosnian, and other noble families that span across Illyria."

 the_pandurs_of_illyria_desc: "The terrain of Illyria is nothing short of rough and hilly. Winding roads weave through the mountains and hills without end with some flat areas in between for respite, all of this we must take into account as we formalize our military. Establishing more mobile light infantry regiments called 'Pandurs' or 'Pudars' would help effectively manage the land we currently hold and would also help secure the lands of the Balkans that most South Slavs call home."
 sabors_to_represent_illyria: "Sabors of Representation"
 sabors_to_represent_illyria_desc: "To help advise the administration, there should be a governing body that is above that of the local governments but beneath that of the royal family and such. A more universal sabor is just such a solution since it has, since back in the 800s, been a place where Croatian nobility could share their opinions on various matters and eventually work toward a common resolution on various topics. If we can model the sabor for a more state-wide scale for Illyria itself, we would be in a much stronger position to hear and work through the issues of our own people."

 the_stopping_point_of_the_ottomans_desc: "When the Ottoman Empire invaded past the Aegean Sea and smited down the likes of the Serbian Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Byzantines, Croatians were understandably worried and so were Bosnians and Hungarians. Though the Ottomans took the fight north toward our lands and the lands of Hungary and Bosnia, it is in Croatia where some of the first defeats were inflicted upon the Ottomans by Christians from the Balkans. Let us relish in this notion of being one of the key factors of stopping the Ottoman threat to Europe and fortify not only our lands from the Turkish threat, but also our people themselves."

 illyrian_serbian_economics: "Silver & Gold Lined Illyria"
 illyrian_serbian_economics_desc: "The mines of the Balkans are rich in the ores they can produce, that much is true, but the rise in banking and mercantile theories across Europe has led to many prominent thinkers of Serbian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and Bosnian descent to question our economic practices as a whole. If we hope to answer these questions in full with sound economic policy, we will need to manage the ores that come out of these mines of ours since increasing silver and gold production could lead to Illyria either becoming a true economic power in Europe, or it could lead to the complete collapse of our own state."

 stability_brings_prosperity_to_illyria_desc: "The last time the Serbian people had a serious period of stability and prosperity was during the reign of Stefan Lazarevic (1402-1427) in the Serbian Despotate, but this is the same for the other South Slavs across the Balkans. Now that Illyria is founded and the Balkans are coming to peace with each other in spite of what the Ottoman Empire has tried to do, we can renew the great days of Stefan Lazarevic and others who brought prosperity to the lands of the Balkans; we will see internal development and construction on a scale our ancestors could only imagine."

 hajduks_and_hussars_desc: "Irregulars of rural areas are becoming normal in the ranks of Illyrian regiments, and so are the swift yet fierce hussars we have cultivated over the past decades. Gone are the days where we relied on poorly equipped levies of peasants and heavily armored knights to take to the field; we of Illyria are heading forth into the future with new stratagies in mind that revolve around lighter and more mobile regiments. This steady change in strategy should also help out logistical matters across the Balkans as well, but only time will tell if that is the case."
 modernize_dusans_code: "New Political Climates"
 modernize_dusans_code_desc: "Dusan's Code was made in about 1349 under the authority of Stefan Uros IV Dusan of the Serbian Empire and for many in Illyria, it is a prime example of just how forward thinking the laws of the various Balkan polities could be. Still though, we are finding more and more aspects of it that are outdated as we continue to progress forth with new ideas and innovations coming about in Illyria today. Modernizing parts of it and getting the approval of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox clergy will certainly help keep the Illyrian administration up-to-date, and we can adapt the code to new and changing standards throughout all of Illyria."
 religion_and_politics_inside_illyria: "Serbia's Lasting Legacy"
 religion_and_politics_inside_illyria_desc: "Our roots are in that of the Serbian people of generations past and their profound commitment to Eastern Orthodoxy, specifically the Serbian Orthodox Church. It has helped and hindered politics in the past, but it has never lost its importance to the people of Serbia, just like how the churches of Bulgaria haven't lost influence with the Bulgarian people. If we can mend the tensions between these various Orthodox churches and also the Catholic bishops and priests of the Balkans, then we will certainly see a more effective administration come forth inside Illyria as a whole."
 
 #Bosnian Version#
 mastery_of_balkan_defenses: "Unbreakable Defenses"
 mastery_of_balkan_defenses_desc: "Despite what some may think when they look at Illyria on a flat map of political colors, our land is something of a maze of hills, dirt paths, scattered villages and towns, and entrenched fortifications strewn all over the place. Few if any can survive a prolonged invasion of Illyrian lands just as many have tried before. The Ottomans have gained ground in the Balkans thanks to their incredible strength and versatility in regular battles, but can they (or any other invader) truly match up to our terrain and defenses when they must break through multiple layers over the course of years, not just months? The answer to that is and will always be a decisive no."
 crowned_authority_to_rule_over_the_others: "By Law and By Divine Right"
 crowned_authority_to_rule_over_the_others_desc: "Rulers stemming from the lands of Bosnia have not been the most favored ever since the fall of Tvrtko I (1353-1377 & 1377-1391) but there is legitimacy to the claims of Bosnan rulers on the thrones of Croatia and Serbia at the very least. The more we also intermarry and establish strong ties to other significant families in Albanian, Slovene, and Bulgarian lands, the better we will be able to ease the conquest of these territories into the fold of Illyria. Ensuring that our authority is backed up by established laws and religious clergy from all sides is what can make ruling over Illyria a lot easier."
 a_stronger_diplomatic_position: "Illyrian Negotiations"
 a_stronger_diplomatic_position_desc: "If there was one great thing from the reign of Tvrtko I that all of Illyria ought to remember, it is how gracious and how firm he was in negotiating with the neighboring states. Despite Bosnians not being in the best position even during his reign, he extended its influence all across the Balkans and had the Kingdom of Bosnia grow to its largest extent ever; he even almost had King Sigismund of Hungary concede at peace negotiations but Tvrtko I died in March of 1390. Now that Illyria is in such a state where it can negotiate on a much more flexible and powerful basis with its neighbors, we will succeed where Tvrtko I left off and again establish friendly relations where we can, and coerce what states we must."
 organize_mining_operations: "Minerals and Ores"
 organize_mining_operations_desc: "The various mines around the Balkans are lucrative in what they produce, but they aren't used as effectively as they could be. Despite the history of South Slavs utilizing silver mines and other minable materials to enhance their prestige and income, there is still room for improvement in how this is all done. From improved mining techniques, safer mines in general, and a more organized way of moving the resources from extraction sites to places where they can be refined and later sold, we of Illyria will come to encompass a great deal of wealth and grandeur as time goes on."
 respect_for_krstjani_catholicism_and_orthodox: "Branches of the Same Tree"
 respect_for_krstjani_catholicism_and_orthodox_desc: "Who are we to judge those who follow the Holy See? And those who follow the Serbian Church? Or the Bulgarian Church? Or any other branch of Christianity for that matter? We all stem from the same core belief in the teachings of Jesus and despite there being some in Illyria who seek out zealous conversions of other branches, we prefer to abstain from this practice altogether. Recognizing the wisdom inherent in each branch of this beautiful tree we are all included in is how we can come to learn new ideas, obtain new theological insights, and develop new respect for those around us as time goes on."
 
 #Bulgarian Version#
 ecclesiastic_politics_settled: "Matters of Faith, Settled"
 ecclesiastic_politics_settled_desc: "The ecclesiastic status of Illyria has been somewhat mysterious for a while now since our roots in the previous iterations of Bulgaria have struggled to maintain the highest status in Eastern Orthodoxy whilst also maintaining good relations with the Holy See in Rome. Pope Innocent III and Kaloyan tried to resolve things several times from 1197-1207, yet it only came forth to a sort of on-paper ecclesiastic peace. Now that Illyria is a much more serious and stable power that can speak for all of the Balkans, we can succeed where our ancestors left off and remedy any questions or disputes between Orthodox and Catholic clergy."
 at_the_edge_of_crusaders: "Memories of Crusader Kings"
 at_the_edge_of_crusaders_desc: "During the Third Crusade, Bulgarians under Asen and Peter IV offered forces to Frederick I Barbarossa to use against the Byzantines, but he declined and instead made peace with our rival; thankfully things ended in disaster for Isaac II during that time when we won a great victory at the Tryavna Pass, but we had another chance at cooperation during the Fourth Crusade. Kaloyan tried to establish friendly relations with the crusaders, but they refused his hand in friendship and instead waged war on him during the years of the Latin Empire. It is this history of being in consistent conflict with these 'crusader kings' that brings vigor to Illyrian soldiers; should any crusade ever be launched toward our domain, we will see to it that they are smited down."
 stabilize_the_southern_balkans: "Bringers of Stability"
 stabilize_the_southern_balkans_desc: "With the Balkans under firm Illyrian control and power stemming out of places like Sofia and Tarnovo, we are finally seeing politics settle down in several places. Libraries are being opened up in prominent towns, roads are being constructed through the many hills where Serbian and Bosnian people live, and we are even seeing the southern most parts of the Balkans begin to prosper as a result of our efforts. It is not without hard work that we have come this far and we will not rest anytime soon in our efforts to keep internal peace a reality."
 cooperation_against_the_ottomans: "The Southern Focus"
 cooperation_against_the_ottomans_desc: "What has been a common factor in the minds of Bulgarians, Serbians, Bosnians, and every other South Slav community is the fact that the Ottoman Empire remains a viable threat despite the efforts of several Christian states in the past. The Second Bulgarian Empire, dismantled by the Turks after the 1340s; the Serbian Empire, torn apart after Emperor Stefan Uros V's death in 1371; and even the Byzantines have been brought to the executioners table. This common cause of uniting against the Ottomans is not and will never be lost on Illyria; we will form a cohesive military and push them back as far as we can. There can be no quarter given in this life or death struggle."
 stone_walls_and_swift_movements: "Like the Wind; Like the Earth"
 stone_walls_and_swift_movements_desc: "As the ages go by and we of Illyria embrace new ideas and new technologies, we must always remember two things from our past that helped us get to where we are: strong fortifications and swift movements of our military. Building our fortresses at strategic locations and with expert engineering and then ensuring that our military is mobile enough to move through the winding hills of the Balkans without issue will keep Illyria on top of any war it is involved in. There will be none that can strike us down one fell swoop, not when we have learned so much from our past and are committed to preserving all that we have obtained."
 
 #Albanian Version#
 skirmishing_over_direct_battle: "Light Combat & Skirmishes"
 skirmishing_over_direct_battle_desc: "The terrain of the Balkans makes pitched battles something we ought to avoid if possible. Using light cavalry and mobile tactics is valuable in our land more so than in the lands of Hungary or the Italian Peninsula, so emphasizing just how swift we can flank and route our enemies whilst keeping our own ranks safe is what we shall do."
 defend_against_venetians_and_turks: "Christian and Muslim Threats"
 defend_against_venetians_and_turks_desc: "From the traitorous Venetians to the vile Turks, South Slavs of Illyria have known little in the way of mercy from outside states. Holding our own in the name of various nobles or various tsars, dukes, despots, or kings, it would be almost unnatural for there to be any sense of enduring peace with our foreign neighbors. This history is why we must always be ready to defend from all sides, and ready to strike back with expertise from commanders and officers who are educated in historic battles and innovative strategies."
 skanderbegs_legacy: "What Skanderbeg Imparted"
 skanderbegs_legacy_desc: "Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu, otherwise known as Skanderbeg, was perhaps the greatest person in generations for all of Albania. Whilst he served on the side of the Ottomans for a long while, his defection and courageous resistance in the face enormous Ottoman forces seeking to crush him and all of Albania is exactly what we of Illyria should look up to! Without his efforts as 'Dominus Albaniae' (Lord of Albania), we would only be in the dreams of men and women throughout the Balkans. Skanderbeg will forever be immortalized in the history of Illyria and will survive in the hearts of minds of all Illyrians, and his courage will flow through every soldier in our military."
 aristocrats_for_a_common_cause: "A Common Cause to Fight for"
 aristocrats_for_a_common_cause_desc: "The old League of Lezhe that was pioneered in the times of Skanderbeg to stop the Ottoman forces invading Albania is no more, but its legacy lives on in our administration to a degree and also in how we treat the nobles of our land. We consistently strive to give them all a common cause to work toward and that is usually military in nature; their wealth and land are great resources that we should utilize as much as we can as Illyria grows internally to become more militarily cogent."
 amends_with_all_the_balkans: "The Leaders of the Balkans"
 amends_with_all_the_balkans_desc: "Whilst the Albanian leaders are some of the most skilled in all of the Balkans, we can and should remember that Illyria is a nation of South Slavs and the leaders of the various regiments should ideally have a variety of South Slavs in them. From Serbians to Croatians to Bulgarians and Slovenes, all need to be encouraged toward leadership roles alongside Albanians themselves."
 
 #Slovene Version#
 illyrian_cooperation_means_prosperity: "Cooperation for Prosperity"
 illyrian_cooperation_means_prosperity_desc: "The fact that Illyria exists is monumental on the face of it, but this sort of league or union or perhaps even federation of South Slavs is not without its tensions. Whether it is due to old dynastic claims or boyars and aristocrats vying for land and wealth, we know all too well that there is going to be hard times ahead if we do not work at all levels of society to ensure cooperation. Establish proper courts, actively taking part in noble affairs to diffuse tension, and perhaps even taking a regular census of major parts of Illyria could give us a serious chance at mitigating overall unrest."
 languages_of_illyria_standardized: "A Collection of Languages"
 languages_of_illyria_standardized_desc: "Though the Austrians, Turks, and Italians may think of our languages as a mere mish-mash of hard-to-learn letters and grammar structures, we of Illyria know that there are actual concrete differences between Slovene, Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, and every other Southern Slavic language. Whilst there is some mutual intelligibility, we cannot and should not deny the differences between all our languages. Standardizing them and making them official in all courts of Illyria over time would put in a far better position in terms of cataloging our own history and fostering a more peaceful atmosphere in the Balkans."
 how_the_austrians_handle_diplomacy: "Holy Roman Diplomacy?"
 how_the_austrians_handle_diplomacy_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is no stranger to diplomacy and we are no stranger to its tendency to want to encompass more and more of its surrounding neighbors in its politics. Austria in particular has made moves eastward and southward, partially intruding on Balkan affairs from time to time and in part giving us a glimpse into how more astute and wise diplomacy is done. Emulating this and being ready with diplomats as well having our diplomats being able to speak multiple languages is something that would benefit Illyria greatly as time goes on, and it may even help gain strategic alliances inside the Holy Roman Empire."
 baroque_in_the_balkan_style: "Changing Times for Balkan Communities"
 baroque_in_the_balkan_style_desc: "As we are gaining knowledge and progressing in our own intellectual pursuits, new aesthetic styles are sprouting across major Illyrian cities. Whether it is in Cilli or Belgrade or Sofia, we should be encouraging these new styles of music and art as they will help make Illyria not only grand to outsiders, but it will also encourage a strong sense of cultural heritage for the nation as a whole. From here on out, we will be pursuing an age Illyrian aesthetics!"
 the_new_middle_class_of_illyria: "The Ever Evolving Middle Class"
 the_new_middle_class_of_illyria_desc: "Our focus on more peaceful diplomacy and fostering a cooperative astomphere in the Balkans whilst also helping introduce South Slavs to a new age of artistic concepts is shaping the middle class of Illyria as a whole. They make trouble for us at times as they demand increased wages, certain trading rights, and even some privileges that are reserved for aristocrats only, but we cannot deny the fact that they are growing in number with each generation that passes and they also help the Illyrian economy grow to a great extent. It would be a death sentence if we were try to stamp down on the middle class, yet we must also keep them on a leash of some sort."

 the_long_roads_between_us: "Long Roads; Vast Lands"
 the_long_roads_between_us_desc: "The great stretches of land we hold sway over are covered in forests and the occasional open stretch of tundra and taiga. It is not easy for outsiders to traverse this land without help from a native Koryak, but we have grown up in these conditions for generation upon generation; any path through these dense trees, hills, valleys, and winding rivers are taught to each and every Koryak that needs the knowledge. We will never be left out in the cold in terms movement from one Koryak community to another, at least not compared to outsiders."
 enlarge_the_capacity_of_siberian_trade: "Expansion of Siberian Trade"
 enlarge_the_capacity_of_siberian_trade_desc: "Thanks to our efforts to build up not only Koryak communities throughout the massive amounts of taiga and tundra we control, we are seeing Siberian trade flourish all across our state. Whilst we are still in the early days of cultivating proper trade routes through our state (chopping trees and setting down firm roads takes a lot of time and effort), we are already seeing the fruits of our past labor. Soon enough, the Koryak people will be seeing hefty amounts of profit going toward investments in up-and-coming towns."
 egalitarianism_from_bands_on_up: "From the Structure of Familial Bands"
 egalitarianism_from_bands_on_up_desc: "At the basic level of things, the Koryak people gathered in groups of 6 or 7 people for a single family and some families would come together to form a band. Despite what foreigners would believe about how our governing structure should be, we often harken back to these simpler times of bands of Koryak people and how the chief had no absolute authority over the others. Instead, a consensus was reached for decisions and often times women were taken into consideration for matters as well. This more equal approach to leadership is exactly what can help guide the Koryak governing body well into the future."
 improving_garments_of_the_koryaks: "New Materials and New Clothing"
 improving_garments_of_the_koryaks_desc: "Though we traditionally used pelts and hides for our clothing, we cannot deny that our expansion outward has granted a great influx of materials into the Koryak state. Communities all across our land are experimenting with various materials to make not only traditional clothing, but also new types of clothing that are still viable in cold climates. With these new garments and materials, there will be no shortage of clothing supplies for both civilian and military purposes."
 reindeer_riders_and_transports: "Reindeer!"
 reindeer_riders_and_transports_desc: "They have been with us since as long as we can remember and they have been faithful companions and gracious working animals. Some may not find them to be the most tame animal, but we of the frigid north have used reindeer for hundreds upon hundreds of years for transporting materials, as a food resource, and even as an animal to ride on for moderate distances. We will never abandon our herds of reindeer and we will continue to value them as a vital part of our culture and state."
 the_unforgiving_nature_of_siberia: "Siberia, Land of the White Death"
 the_unforgiving_nature_of_siberia_desc: "The land we have called home for countless generations is nothing short of a frosted-over wasteland for most foreigners. There are some who know these lands similar to us, but they are few and far between and won't be the ones who come to threaten our lands. The ones who do threaten the Koryak people will find that they are throwing men and materials into an merciless and hopeless campaign against nature itself. Whichever survive the iced-over winter months we will beat back against the backdrop of snow covered forests."
 what_is_learned_from_hunting: "To Hunt is to Learn for Life"
 what_is_learned_from_hunting_desc: "Hunting is an intrinsic part of Koryak culture, is it not? Survival in our lands has meant learning to track and hunt prey, lest death is something that is preferred. As such, each and every successful hunter of the Koryaks (of which it is most of our population as for some it has become a competition of sorts) is equipped with knowledge of tracking movements and waiting till the time is right to strike. These hunters of ours are also the backbone of our military command and as such, they take their hunting skills into whatever battle they find themselves in."

 colonizers_of_vast_taiga_and_tundra: "Settle the Taiga and Tundra"
 colonizers_of_vast_taiga_and_tundra_desc: "Through our ways of living both in a nomadic fashion and in a settled fashion, the vast swaths of tundra and taiga that cover our region have become dotted with Evenk settlements. As our numbers grow under this rather new style of governance, we will continue to promote Evenk settlements that utilize both hunted game and farmed crops to grow in an organized and healthy manner. The vast stretches of land we live in are not merely places that are meant for hunting and gathering; we can and will make these lands valuable and sustainable."
 southern_influences_on_the_koryaks: "Southern Influence on Evenk Society"
 southern_influences_on_the_koryaks_desc: "From the likes of the Mongols and Jurchens to the interesting Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese, influences in Evenk communities ranging from new religious practices to new methods of building structures are very evident. We cannot deny that these new ways of building structures and learning about philosophy and theology are intriguing to say the least, and several prominent members of the Evenk government have seen to it that trade deals be made with the various people to our south. As we get new woods, new cloths, and even new practices to incorporate into Evenk society, we will learn to become a much more innovative state in general."
 hunting_in_two_ways: "By Bow and Musket"
 hunting_in_two_ways_desc: "Whilst we have hunted by the bow-and-arrow for generations upon generations, we cannot deny the power shown to us from skirmishes and trade deals with southern people. They use these weapons of blazing fire and plumes of smoke with great success, knocking down both both human and animal alike with ease, and unlike a traditional bow-and-arrow, they need very little training with these weapons of fire and smoke. If we can take up these weapons and use them to our own advantage both when hunting for food and hunting down our enemies, the Evenks will be a much more capable people as a whole."
 the_respect_we_have_for_animals: "Respect for the Animals"
 the_respect_we_have_for_animals_desc: "One facet of our traditions that we will forever hold close to us is that of respecting the animals that thrive in nature. Though we may kill some for our own purposes like clothing and food, we do not defile animals nor do we torment animals; putting said animals out of their misery if we are hunting them is what we must always do. Thus, as our leaders carry forth this tradition as well and display their own respect for the animals found in nature, so to will others in Evenk society."
 welcoming_into_the_vast_family_home: "Welcome to the Family"
 welcoming_into_the_vast_family_home_desc: "Though our land is vast and open, it is not without its people who are closed off to outsiders, suspicious of how they act and what they might do. In an effort to help open up Evenk society and to encourage acceptance on both sides, we should encourage the view of these lands of ours being a family home of sorts. Welcoming others into it and meeting them halfway in the form of accommodations and spaces to live (since we have so much of it) can be the start of things; helping educate Evenk people on just who exactly is in the Evenk state can be the start of the other side of things."
 respect_for_nature_and_its_protection: "Cold and Protective Nature"
 respect_for_nature_and_its_protection_desc: "Our friends to the north know all too well just how harsh the lands we are in can be. Invading into the lands we hold and even further to the north is asking to be frozen to death, or to die trying to beat down an enemy far away in their warm town. The Evenks will ensure winter and its frigid temperatures will be of the utmost advantage to them when war breaks out, and our defensive measures will be ready at all times of the year so that no enemy can make it into our territory without leaving a trail of their own blood and bodies behind."

 join_together_against_common_threats_desc: "The Assiniboine and the various Cree branches have known years of peace, but not as of late. For what seems like generations now, we have struggled against the various people of the plains and the lakes who seek to either snuff us out or force us into serving their needs. Finally we have to reject this! After garnering enough power and striving for unity amongst Cree and Assiniboine bands of various places nearby, we have come together into one uneasy but undoubtedly strong confederacy. With our shared strength, there will be none who can break our hearts of iron!"
 middle_man_of_fur_trading: "Dawn of the Fur Trade"
 middle_man_of_fur_trading_desc: "Foreigners to our lands seek many things and will trade a variety of new resources for what is plentiful in the lands of ours, but just how much can we trust these new people? Whilst we debate on how much trust we will place in them, we can at the very least engage in commerce and trade throughout our land so as to gain new resources that can facilitate our expansion both internally and externally."
 confederacy_against_confederacy: "Blood for Blood; Body for Body"
 confederacy_against_confederacy_desc: "While we would prefer to keep peace with our neighboring tribes and states, we cannot simply let their raids and ambushes go on without an answer. They seek to usurp the trade routes we are holding on to and they seek to take the land by which we currently live on, what kind of response should this incur then? To those who say one of simple diplomacy, they are sorely mistaken. We will repay our neighbors for the blood they spill and the lives they shed, and the lands around us that change hands often will know peace in the hands of the Cree and the Assiniboine."
 strengthen_the_strained_bonds: "Rectify Old Bonds"
 strengthen_the_strained_bonds_desc: "The alliances and bonds that originally made up this confederacy are not as strong as they once were. The years have truly strained relations between various Assiniboine and Cree bands and leaders, yet they still find reasons to work together instead of fighting each other. Let us attempt to kindle these age-old bonds once again and rectify old tensions that have lingered for far too long. The more peace we can have internally, the more we will be able to focus on other matters."
 skirmishers_of_the_forests_and_hills: "Perfect our Fighting Style"
 skirmishers_of_the_forests_and_hills_desc: "While the terrain that we fight on is not uniform, the fighting style that we have adopted over time is more uniform in a sense. We aren't as adept with cavalry as other plains cultures are, yet we have more in the way of woods and hills in our land, meaning that cavalry are not as useful as quick moving warriors on foot. If we can train our own warriors routinely in this type of mobile, light combat in conjunction with the muskets being spread around our land, we will be in a far better position to defend our independence."
 facilitate_greater_movement_of_goods: "Moving Goods of Greater Value"
 facilitate_greater_movement_of_goods_desc: "With gunpowder, various metals, and new types of food being introduced to our land and our people, the trade routes we normally control are being used to transport more than just furs and pelts. Now we are seeing the movement of new resources that are of value not only to foreigners, but to practically everyone around us as well our people. Strengthening our grip on trade through better trade deals and more secure trading areas is what can and will keep our hold over the current trade routes absolute."

 consolidation_of_the_plains_desc: "The plains are changing, can others see it too? We have hunted the bison that roam the great plains like others, but some of our highest leaders state repeatedly that this cannot last forever. Dwindling numbers of bison in certain places and scarce numbers of animals needed for the fur trade are putting pressure on our people to adapt to this changing world. We must work toward finding new ways of making money; whether that is in producing manufactured goods or taking to a more agrarian life, we will adapt and we will survive."

 toward_all_of_ruthenia_desc: "Though the Poles and the Russians would seek to subjugate this bountiful land we call home, we refuse them at all points! Whatever price we must pay in cold money or in furious bloodshed, we will pay it, for this land of Ruthenia deserves to be governed by its own people, not by some far off foreigner in Moscow, Krakow, or Vilnius."
 all_under_the_zaoporzhian_host: "All Under the Host"
 all_under_the_zaoporzhian_host_desc: "Within the Hetmanate, there is the Zaporozhian Host which is led by the Sich Rada. The Sich Rada elects the Kosh Otaman, the host's leader, and he is aided by a number of people so that governance of the host and subsequently of the entire Hetmanate is not akin to an absolute monarchy. Power here is best when it is shared amongst proven people with merit from years of experience, and these years of experience will make them well known and well respected."
 exiles_and_freedom_seekers: "Exiled No Longer"
 exiles_and_freedom_seekers_desc: "The lands of the Hetmanate are quite different from those of the Holy Roman Empire, the land of the Russians, or even the land of the Ottomans. Many flee to our land because they have been exiled from their original homeland, meaning we have intricate and shady connections in these foreign lands. In time we will be able to use these connections to not only bolster our own numbers, but also disrupt the authority in rival states nearby."
 the_kish_the_sich_rada_and_military_court: "The Kish & The Sich Rada"
 the_kish_the_sich_rada_and_military_court_desc: "The Kish, or, Zaporozhian Host and the Sich Rada within it are very much the governing body of the land, but also beyond this they are the premier military force of the entire Hetmanate. The election at the Sich Rada is made up of cossacks as it is, and anyone who is one of the cossacks may vote regardless of their origins. This gives us a degree of administrative flexibility, but it also encourages a military tradition that transcends barriers of class that are normally present in other states around us."
 cossack_infantry_supremacy: "Supremacy on Foot"
 cossack_infantry_supremacy_desc: "The open fields of Ruthenia are known for their cavalry and the steppe people who practiced cavalry tactics without end, but the Hetmanate is not reliant on cavalry-based strategies anymore. Increasingly our forces utilize muskets and artillery pieces over melee weapons and cavalry tactics as muskets and artillery are fairly easy to learn for everyone. The more of this we encourage in our own ranks, the better off we will be in fending off invasions into Ruthenia."

 the_price_we_set_for_service_desc: "So much so is our performance in battle noticed by other European and Muslim states that we to receive offers to rent out certain regiments for service elsewhere. Whilst we are no stranger to mercenary work, integrating it more into the administration of the Hetmanate would allow for more regiments to be rented out for higher prices."
 kleinody: "Kleinody!"
 kleinody_desc: "Important items to the Zaporozhian Host, these Kleinody (a sort of imperial regalia) are prestigious and honorable objects that few in our ranks every obtain. Having one grants the status of officer, though there are specific ranks for certain kleinody (the highest one being the 'bulawa' or mace carried by the host himself). The longer we hold on to these glorious heirlooms of the past, the greater our prestige will be for future generations and in the eyes of foreigners."
