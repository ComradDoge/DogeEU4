 HKC_ideas_start: "Hokucho Traditions"
 HKC_ideas_bonus: "Hokucho Ambition"
 empowered_bakufu_of_japan: "Empower the Shogun"
 empowered_bakufu_of_japan_desc: "Japanese people only truly prosper under strict military guidance and authority. The shogun knows just how to help enforce this and will indeed do so with the emperor tucked away in a nice palace where people can think he is nothing more than a nice leading figure. The shogun's guidance must indeed lead to rightful conquest for the Japanese people."
 disempowered_emperor_of_japan: "Disempower the Emperor"
 disempowered_emperor_of_japan_desc: "With the emperor out of the way and having little actual legislative or military power throughout our land and all of Japan itself, there will be little in the way of us cultivating a strong military that strives for upholding the peace and prosperity of our land, the lands of the Northern Court."
 proper_vassal_ties: "Proper Subject Ties"
 proper_vassal_ties_desc: "The matter of how we deal with our subjects, both ones that pay regular tributes and ones that do not, is going to be something that comes up routinely in the politics of Hokucho. Let us tend to these matters with diligence and discipline so as to obtain the most out of our subject states, for that is the only way we will be able to ensure a strong and stable diplomatic sector."
 emphasis_on_military_skill: "Emphasis on Martial Prowess"
 emphasis_on_military_skill_desc: "The shogunate embodiers martial prowess emphasized over other matters, and though at times the administration itself is quite decentralized there is a staunch focus on military quality when ascending upwards in rank and title. As time goes on, our officers and commanders will be seasoned in military strategy and tactics so that the troops they command are led properly and without worry from the shogun."
 disciplined_samurai_class: "The Discipline of the Samurai"
 disciplined_samurai_class_desc: "Though at times the samurai of our Hokucho can be unruly, there is little doubt that they have great military potential. If we can tame them and integrate them into Hokucho ranks throughout the coming decades, there will be few that will be able to compete with our soldiers and the discipline they possess."
 solve_administrative_conflicts: "Conflicts of Interest"
 solve_administrative_conflicts_desc: "Inside the administration of the Northern Court, politics can often get messy between various advisors and officials, especially when it comes to various family ties and land grants. The shogun and those around him should ideally work toward a stable system of politics that can regularly appoint people to positions of prominence without worry of backlash from others since doing so will certainly create a good deal of legitimacy amongst the people."
 undo_rival_lord_power: "A Sword to Petty Rivals"
 undo_rival_lord_power_desc: "And within the lands of the Hokucho, shugo lords and certain daimyo who think they can oppose the will of the shogun will be handed their own head separated from their body. There will be no tolerance for unruly governors and such and we will ensure that loyal soldiers will cut down all who stand in the way of the progress of Hokucho."
 NNC_ideas: "Nancho Ideas"
 NNC_ideas_start: "Nancho Traditions"
 NNC_ideas_bonus: "Nancho Ambition"
 the_three_japanese_regalia: "The Three Sacred Treasures"
 the_three_japanese_regalia_desc: "Kusanagi no Tsurugi representing valor, Yata no Kagami representing wisdom, and Yasakani no Magatama representing benevolence; these are the three sacred treasure of Japan. Brought to our land by Ninigi-no-Mikoto, the legendary ancestor of the Imperial House of Japan, the Southern Court is the one that holds these grand relics. Those of the Northern Court or any other possible court in Japan are mere pretenders to the title of emperor and the power it wields and with these relics, we will make it known."
 restoration_of_true_imperial_power: "Restore True Imperial Power"
 restoration_of_true_imperial_power_desc: "With daimyo being scattered across Japan and a civilian administration not being present in the slightest, the people seeing the emperor in Nancho as both legitimate and taking the reins of command emboldens them in the face of adversity. No longer is it a military authority that is trying to lead the Japanese people, but rather it is the emperor himself and those loyal to him and the traditions of old. Let these traditions guide us into the future and strengthen the heart and soul of our military."
 reinstate_offices_of_civil_governors: "Reinstate Civil Governors"
 reinstate_offices_of_civil_governors_desc: "During the Nanboku-cho Jidai of 1336 to 1392, the office of 'civil governor' was gradually taken over by shugo lords all across Japan. They were in essence both governors with legitimate duties to uphold and feudal lords that vied for power amongst other feudal lords, causing both tension and decentralization throughout the land. If we can dismantle the system that brought the shugo lords to power and reinstate the offices of civil governors, we can ease the administrative burden on the Southern Court."
 disempower_the_shugo_lords: "Disempower the Shugo Lords"
 disempower_the_shugo_lords_desc: "Once we are done disempowering the shugo lords that once held a great deal of power over the lands of Japan, we can focus on bringing up the diplomatic posture of Japan to outside powers and people. Formalizing diplomatic relations and also ensuring that our land is free from foreign intrigue will go a long way in ensuring the prosperity of Nancho."
 endurace_of_the_southern_court: "Endurance of Nancho"
 endurace_of_the_southern_court_desc: "Though the Northern Court was slowed by a number of administrative difficulties during the Nanboku-cho Jidai, they still retained great military power and used it against the Southern Court, grinding it down into dust eventually. But, the Southern Court did not simply yield to these efforts from the north in one single battle, no, they endured for decades knowing that they were the rightful rulers of Japan. It is this enduring spirit that we must cultivate once more in our people."
 expand_and_reform_the_kanrei: "Expand and Reform the Kanrei"
 expand_and_reform_the_kanrei_desc: "The kanrei has been a sort of deputy to the shogun and has served as one to help in administrative functions throughout the shogunate in the past; Ashikaga Yoshiakira (son of Ashikaga Takauji) had Hosokawa Yoriyuki as his kanrei and was successful in a a variety of political matters concerning shugo lords. If we can emulate this position of deputy for the emperor and expand the position with perhaps multiple deputies, there could be a great deal of legislation that becomes easier to discuss and push through."
 sole_legitimacy_over_japan: "The Only Keeper of Japan"
 sole_legitimacy_over_japan_desc: "The mon of Nancho will be what people gather to support the rightful emperor. Whether they be clans like the Kitabatake, the Tsutsui, the Date, or any others, they will know that there is one sole protector and leader of Japan and that is the emperor of the Nancho, the Southern Court. May the names of the Northern Court pretenders forever be tainted with illegitimacy."
 KNM_ideas: "Kenmu Ideas"
 KNM_ideas_start: "Kenmu Traditions"
 KNM_ideas_bonus: "Kenmu Ambition"
 spearhead_of_the_emperor: "The Emperor as our Leader"
 spearhead_of_the_emperor_desc: "The concept of the 'Kenmu Restoration' was spearheaded by Emperor Go-Daigo amidst the collapsing authority of the Kamakura Shogunate in the early 1330s. His ambition to retake authority away from the shogun and to bring back the power of the emperor is something to look up to as it is a shining example of what our lands could have been like without harsh military leadership."
 properly_deal_with_the_samurai_class: "To Deal with the Samurai Class"
 properly_deal_with_the_samurai_class_desc: "The class of unruly and powerful samurai in Japanese society has been a consistent factor in determining which daimyo thrives or dies, which shogun rises to power or dies mysteriously, and what laws get enforced on the local level in various provinces. We cannot let this continue and we must find a way to satisfy the samurai via proper military centralization and a thoroughly thought out army organization."
 land_owndership_questions: "How to Deal with Land Ownership"
 land_owndership_questions_desc: "Land ownership is also a tricky matter we must deal with if we are to be a true successor to the older Kenmu Restoration. Back then it was poorly handled thanks to Emperor Go-Daigo's various allies and supporters being people he didn't want to take land from, but we are stronger now administratively and can properly push through legislation that will refine the laws on land ownership without causing a breakdown in society."
 go_daigos_failure_with_civilians: "Emperor Go-Daigo's Civilian Failures"
 go_daigos_failure_with_civilians_desc: "A key failure in Emperor Go-Daigo's methods was not fulfilling his ambition to bring back the control of lands to civilians which angered quite a few people. If we can sort through the old laws on the books and build upon our earlier work that focused on land ownership, we can properly satisfy our people's need for land reform."
 the_military_class_do_not_rule: "Organize Classes in Society"
 the_military_class_do_not_rule_desc: "All too often we see the military class come forth to try to take control of the administration and away from the emperor. Indeed this is how the Ashikaga Shogunate came to power since its founder, Ashikaga Takauji, believed that the military class had the right to rule which flew in the face of Emperor Go-Daigo. We of Kenmu will not let this happen again and we will instead ensure that the military is kept under a tight and disciplined leash."
 go_daigos_corruption_failures: "Emperor Go-Daigo's Corruption"
 go_daigos_corruption_failures_desc: "Another facet of the Kenmu Restoration under Emperor Go-Daigo was the corruption and inexperience inherent within the tribunal system he set up. We should strive for a new tribunal and court system like Emperor Go-Daigo wanted, but place a much greater emphasis on education for the various positions needed and also work to make sure that corrupt ties do not seep into the system."
 put_the_governors_back_into_place: "Reinstate the Emperor's Authority"
 put_the_governors_back_into_place_desc: "The time for military governments is now over; the time for civilian governments is now. The emperor may not seem much different from the shogun, but in reality he rules with a comparatively lighter hold on the land and is not keen on a decentralized system of authority that places faith in military governors backed by unruly samurai. In time, the emperor's authority will become a welcome presence in all domains that the Japanese rule over."
 LML_ideas: "Lombard League Ideas"
 LML_ideas_start: "Lombard League Traditions"
 LML_ideas_bonus: "Lombard League Ambition"
 in_defense_of_the_peninsula: "In Defense of the Peninsula"
 in_defense_of_the_peninsula_desc: "The Italian Peninsula is rife with disruptions what with the Pope wanting power and various minor dukes and officials wanting power as well, but if there is one thing we are unified in, it is in defending the peninsula from foreign influence and aggression, especially when it comes the north. The Lombard League will stand tall and ready to defend the northern part of the peninsula once more!"
 papal_sanctioned_protection: "Sanctioned Defense"
 papal_sanctioned_protection_desc: "The Pope sanctioned our defense of the Italian Peninsula from the Holy Roman Empire's Frederick I and Frederick II, thus giving our military more justification and legitimacy when they took to the various walled cities to defend against invading armies of the Holy Roman Empire. The defense of the peninsula will of course be sanctioned once more should it be necessary, and even if the Pope cannot sanction us right at the time we need it, a cardinal or bishop will do just as well."
 cities_opposed_to_the_hre: "Opposition to the Holy Roman Empire"
 cities_opposed_to_the_hre_desc: "Those inside the Holy Roman Empire who stand against expanding influence of the emperor are mostly of Italian descent since our identity and culture is far different from places such as Bavaria, Saxony, and Verden. Though it will be tough to properly coordinate politics and military affairs amongst the various Italian cities of the north, we can be sure that if we succeed in coordinating a unified strategy for our combined military forces, there will be none who can break the Lombard League."
 beyond_driot_de_regale: "Beyond the Driot de Regale"
 beyond_driot_de_regale_desc: "The Peace of Constance in 1183 established a compromise between Italian cities and the emperor of Holy Roman Empire wherein, the cities would retain a level of autonomy (driot de regale) in exchange for loyalty to the emperor. This agreement is long forgotten by many people in the heart of the Holy Roman Empire, but Italian cities remember it dearly. There will be more than just autonomy for the Italian cities, there will be independence with Italians governing themselves!"
 turn_over_any_imperial_ban: "An Imperial Ban is Nothing"
 turn_over_any_imperial_ban_desc: "When Emperor Frederick II tried to gain more power in the peninsula, he issued an Imperial Ban on the Lombard League wand waged war against it back then. This is seen by us as a badge of honor instead of a mark of shame as we fought back bravely against the armies of the Holy Roman Empire and won at the Siege of Parma in 1248! Let others who oppose the central power of the Holy Roman Empire join our effort to dismantle it!"
 reform_the_universitas: "Reform the Universitas"
 reform_the_universitas_desc: "The 'universitas' of the old Lombard League was a council that consisted of representatives appointed by individual municipalities; it voted via a majority on various matters like new members being admitted and whether to wage continued war or strive for peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Reforming this representative part of our government will help keep the spirit of republican ideals alive and well."
 customs_union_and_trade_privleges: "Refine the Customs Union"
 customs_union_and_trade_privleges_desc: "Whilst the Lombard League has traditionally been a decentralized confederation of sorts overall, the past iterations of it saw the creation of a customs union that handled matters of trade much more effectively than smaller trade guilds used to. If we can build upon that foundation of a customs union and refine it as time goes on with better business practices, the Lombard League may indeed be more profitable when united like this."
 SMA_ideas: "Somali Ideas"
 SMA_ideas_start: "Somali Traditions"
 SMA_ideas_bonus: "Somali Ambition"
 united_somali_communites: "United Somali Communities"
 united_somali_communites_desc: "The various Somali communities and towns that are spread across the Horn of Africa have been fractured in the past, swearing loyalty to different leaders so that one day they would see unification. It was a turbulent path to unity but out of the fires of war and through firm diplomacy, Somali people can finally say with confidence that they are united behind one flag and one state, ready to defend it no matter the cost."
 dominant_merchant_fleets: "Fleets of Somalia"
 dominant_merchant_fleets_desc: "Somali people have made their living off of trade for centuries thanks to the great coastal cities that provide safe places for merchant vessels. Guarding these waters against attacking raiders and such is also part of what earns Somali people prosperity and a good reputation, and it is because of this protective attitude toward our coasts and trade routes that we have amassed such a magnificent fleet."
 hegemony_over_ports: "Harbors of Somali Strength"
 hegemony_over_ports_desc: "Improving and building up our habors and docks is a natural part of promoting trade growth. From setting up new docking areas to building new structures for merchants to do business in, each one of our coastal cities and harbors is key in attracting merchants from everywhere we can think of."
 formal_clan_duties: "Formal Clan Duties"
 formal_clan_duties_desc: "The various clans of Somalia are diverse in their origins and they pose a possible threat to our power if they become dissatisfied with our authority. By structuring the government of Somalia in such a way that it gives each formal clan a workable position in Somalia, we can lessen the threat they pose and increase the amount of resources they give to us, the most important one being men capable of fighting."
 somali_honor_guards: "Somali Honor Guards"
 somali_honor_guards_desc: "We have been the victims of our own ambition, in a sense. We desire wealth and prosperity through trade, thus we lacked the ambition to formulate a proper military on land that could at least defend Somali communities effectively. It is now that we will turn this around and begin instituting strong reforms to the Somali soldiers aimed at instilling discipline in them. It will take a long time to achieve our goals for our military, but laying a solid foundation here and now will go a long way in Somalia's future."
 command_east_africa: "Command of East Africa"
 command_east_africa_desc: "Our ambitions in East Africa are known all across our administration and as we continue to project our power over the great cities of wealth that line the coast of East Africa, we will only see our revenue rise higher and higher. Few can contest the amount of wealth made in cities such as Zanzibar and Mombasa as it is, now imagine how much more wealth they would bring in if we controlled them."
 somali_ocean: "The Somali Ocean"
 somali_ocean_desc: "The vast ocean to our east, it is rife with opportunity if we can claim it for ourselves, but we will not be the only ones sending ships out there to claim trade routes and mercantile chances. Our ships and sailors need to be ever present and ever vigilant of what threats there are to our extensive trading in the ocean, and when intruders try to break into the Somali Ocean despite our hegemony, we will gladly send them to the dark depths of the ocean."
 FJI_ideas: "Fujiwara Ideas"
 FJI_ideas_start: "Fujiwara Traditions"
 FJI_ideas_bonus: "Fujiwara Ambition"
 foremost_clan_closest_to_power: "Fujiwara Soft Dominance"
 foremost_clan_closest_to_power_desc: "From about the 900s to about the 1100s, the Fujiwara Clan was at its peak with soft power being extended all around Japanese land thanks to familial connections to the emperor. It is time that the Fujiwara Clan is known once more in every part of Japan instead of these petty clans that split off from our old rivals so long ago. Our sons and daughters will find good company in various families of prominence and we will find ourselves with an immense amount of power in time."
 the_sessho_and_kampaku_positions: "Positions as Sessho and Kampaku"
 the_sessho_and_kampaku_positions_desc: "Sessho is a title traditionally given to the regent of a child emperor; kampaku is traditionally something of a chief advisor, first secretary, and regent who assists the adult emperor. It was during the Heian Period some centuries ago that the Fujiwara Clan held these two positions with relative ease and without worry (a cadet branch named Hokke was able to establish a hereditary claim to the position of regent as a whole). It is time that these two positions come back to being firmly under the Fujiwara Clan as a whole."
 strong_links_via_soft_power: "Utilize Familial Connections"
 strong_links_via_soft_power_desc: "Perhaps our most prominent familial ancestor was Fujiwara no Michinaga (966-1027). Grandfather of three emperors, father of six empresses, and the grandfather of seven other imperial consorts, it is by no means an exaggeration to say that he symbolized the apex of Fujiwara power and influence. We will strive to do similarly to Fujiwara no Michinaga and establish dynastic ties and links with foreign families to ensure that our soft power spreads even further, possibly beyond the lands of Japan itself."
 uphold_strict_family_governance: "Strict Family Governance"
 uphold_strict_family_governance_desc: "During the height of the Fujiwara Clan's power, several lesser members were court nobles, provincial governors, members of the provincial aristocracy, and even some were known as samurai. By emphasizing strict family governance and promoting better education efforts for the Fujiwara Clan as a whole, we can ensure a much stronger administration that can keep our lands stable no matter what happens."
 to_become_the_puppet_master: "Becoming the Puppet Master"
 to_become_the_puppet_master_desc: "Slowly but surely, Fujiwara influence is seeping into every part of Japanese society. Those clans that might still hold out against our resurgence will not hold out for much longer as our network of nobles and warriors will surely catch them out sooner or later. When all is said and done, there will be only the Fujiwara Clan left to be the military and administrative puppet master of the entirety of Japan."
 a_new_period_of_cultural_flourishing: "Renewed Cultural Flourishing"
 a_new_period_of_cultural_flourishing_desc: "Whilst our administration is handling the likes of provincial matters and passing laws to ensure that our power is felt all across the land, many members of the Fujiwara Clan are seeking a renewed period of cultural insight through the likes of poetry and plays. Though this path may seem useless and not worth the effort to various samurai leaders, we recognize that we have the power to establish a new golden age of Japanese culture if we simply empower our people to strive for it."
 steady_enforcement_of_fujiwara_power: "All under the Fujiwara Clan"
 steady_enforcement_of_fujiwara_power_desc: "Though our influence declined beyond the 1100s due to the Taira Clan and the Minamoto Clan fighting for power in Heian-kyo, they remained dominant in terms of being close advisors the emperors. Now that there is one grand clan that is uniting all of Japan under its authority, few will be able to oppose the soft power we project through our family members and also the hard power we have in the form of a strong military sector."
 TAA_ideas: "Taira Ideas"
 TAA_ideas_start: "Taira Traditions"
 TAA_ideas_bonus: "Taira Ambition"
 the_kanmu_heishi_lineage: "The Kanmu Heishi Lineage"
 the_kanmu_heishi_lineage_desc: "Some grandchildren of Emperor Kanmu (736-806) were the first to actually take on the name 'Taira' after 825. Though other descendants of Emperor Nimmyo, Montoku, and Koko took on the name 'Taira', it was the ones descended from Emperor Kanmu that became the most prominent in Japan. Those of the Kanmu Heishi lineage, founded in 889 by Taira no Takamochi, became some of the most influential people during the Heian Period. Though times have changed since the days of the Heian Period, the Kanmu Heishi lines of descent are still very much around and we will utilize them as much as we can."
 taira_no_kiyomori_samurai_lineage: "Taira no Kiyomori's Samurai"
 taira_no_kiyomori_samurai_lineage_desc: "Learning from what Taira no Kiyomori did with those under his command will help us better organize the Taira military sector since Taira no Kiyomori organized one of the first samurai government structures in all of Japan. If we can compound on this and refine the structure as time goes on, officers and commanders of our military will be in a much better position whenever war comes to our clan."
 the_hogen_and_heiji_rebellions: "The Hogen and Heiji Disturbances"
 the_hogen_and_heiji_rebellions_desc: "The Hogen and Heiji Disturbances were relatively short civil wars that resulted in a variety of politics shifting in Japan for the time, but the most prominent shift was the Fujiwara Clan falling from power and us, the Taira Clan, becoming stronger than ever before. We remember this time fondly and live for the day when we can restore our power to this point, but we must contend with the fact that it may be a while before we hold most of Japan under our authority."
 rein_in_the_kanmu_heishi_lines: "Rein in the Branching Clans"
 rein_in_the_kanmu_heishi_lines_desc: "The various clans that branched off of the Kanmu Heishi lineage became various local governors and daimyo as time went on. Those of the Chiba, Miura, and original Hatakeyama Clan are just some of the most prominent branches of the lineage and they will need to be reined sooner rather than later so that the Taira Clan itself has no true opposition to its power. If we cannot rein them in via diplomatic means, then we will fight them in the field of battle."
 learn_from_loss_in_the_genpei: "Losses in the Genpei War"
 learn_from_loss_in_the_genpei_desc: "The Genpei War was more or less the end of Taira power since Minamoto no Yoritomo's rebellion culminated in the Kamakura Shogunate. If we are to restore our old power and retain it through the fires and rebellion, then we must build up our military tactics and strategy to the point that we can counter any internal threats we may face."
 defeat_minamoto_power: "Defeat the Minamoto Descendants"
 defeat_minamoto_power_desc: "Though the Kamakura Shogunate ended after the Kenmu Restoration, the various branching dynasties of the Minamoto Clan are still a viable threat to the power of the Taira Clan. Building up a large enough military to combat them will be key since in this age of ever evolving diplomacy and military technology, they could bring to light things we have not yet faced. No matter what it takes, we must crush any lingering source of Minamoto power."
 restoration_of_proper_power: "Revived and Refined"
 restoration_of_proper_power_desc: "With our resurgence close to being fully realized and few others standing in our way, there are few who can doubt the legitimacy of our administration and its leadership. The Fujiwara Clan is out of politics for good, Minamoto Clan is thoroughly swept out of any scene we care for, and the Tachibana Clan has been gone for centuries now. Let us usher in a new age of grandeur for the Japanese people, and let the Taira Clan bring a new age of prosperity upon a united Japan."

 the_21_genji_lines: "The 21 Genji Branches"
 the_21_genji_lines_desc: "The various branchs of the Minamoto Clan are descended from various emperors from the past. Though some branches are no longer around, many still are and hold a considerable amount of power around Japan, power that we will need to take for ourselves if we wish to succeed in the future. Once all the branches are reined in, we will have an a vast amount of manpower to draw from for future conflicts."
 guardians_of_heian_kyo: "Guarding Heian-kyo"
 guardians_of_heian_kyo_desc: "When the Fujiwara Clan was in power, they often called upon Minamoto Clan members to restore order in Heian-kyo when things broke down into violent clashes. This legacy of guarding the imperial capital is what instills discipline into the heart of many Minamoto soldiers and leaders and we will continue the tradition long into the future. The greatest of our soldiers will know honor and grandeur in the imperial capital, but they will never drop in their disciplinary missions or measures."
 destruction_of_the_taira_clan: "Destruction of the Taira Clan"
 destruction_of_the_taira_clan_desc: "The rule of the Taira Clan was brief by some accounts, but it was a long and arduous period for the Minamoto Clan. It was only by Minamoto no Yoritomo's efforts in starting the Genpei War that we came to ultimate power, founding the Kamakura Shogunate shortly after and bringing a great amount of prestige and honor to our clan. Let this destruction of the Taira Clan be a memory that all in the Minamoto Clan cherish, for it was the time when we saw our grand rise to power."
 legacy_of_the_first_bakufu: "Legacy of the Kamakura Shogunate"
 legacy_of_the_first_bakufu_desc: "The Kamakura Shogunate was where we held immense amounts of power throughout Japan, but it was not complete as there were those who tried to oppose our authority and decentralize the administration. If we can reinstate our authority with a new shogunate and cultivate a much stronger central administration, there will be none who can escape our grasp and enforce their own local edicts."
 restoration_of_minamoto_power: "Restore Minamoto Power"
 restoration_of_minamoto_power_desc: "To properly restore Minamoto power, land will need to be annexed, local lords will need to be culled, and strict adherence to our laws must the norm. The largest hurdle for us will be the annexation of land though, since there are many in Japan and even outside of Japan who would oppose the grand unification that we dream of."
 revoke_the_power_of_shikken: "Revoke the Power of the Shikken"
 revoke_the_power_of_shikken_desc: "During the time of the Kamakura Shogunate, the shikken was a titular post traditionally held by a member of the Hojo Clan. They were supposed to be a regent for us until the young leader-to-be was ready to take hold of command, but throughout political moves and various ties to family members, the Hojo Clan was able to maintain ultimate authority in the administration whilst the shogun was reduced in power. We will learn from this and ensure that no shikken is ever able to use the Minamoto Clan in such a way like a puppet master would."
 the_one_true_leader_of_japan: "Ascend Feudal Politics"
 the_one_true_leader_of_japan_desc: "From the grounds of feudal politics, the Minamoto Clan has found both great power and solid foundation for its rise to power. Through the discipline of our military and through the military-oriented administration of the shogunate, we will cultivate a new future for our people that is brighter than ever before! The Minamoto Clan will know no boundaries and its blades will cut through any enemy that stands in the way!"

 lvn_symbol_of_italian_unification_desc: "Shattered into feuding duchies and republics that want power, wealth, and prestige, the lands of the Italian Peninsula are rife with warfare and tension that others have exploited for centuries. With the unification of Lombards and Venetians though, there is something that can finally begin to fully unite the people of Italy together into one cohesive state that is governed by Italians, for Italians. Let those pesky French, Spanish, and German monarchs be cast away as we make our grand rise to power!"
 lvn_land_and_sea_arsenal: "Lombard Armories; Venetian Arsenals"
 lvn_land_and_sea_arsenal_desc: "Whether by sea or by land, we will always be ready for battle. Foundations in Milan and Venice mean that we are capable of fielding proper troops and ships in an organized fashion that is comparable to the likes of other large states; the only thing limiting us in this regard is how much we can really afford. Disciplined troops and strudy ships are not cheap, but we know for a fact that Lombardy-Venetia can produce both without failure."
 lvn_honest_representation_of_italians: "Represent the Italian People"
 lvn_honest_representation_of_italians_desc: "Monarchy? Republic? Both are options for Lombardy-Venetia, but what is not an optional is representing the various Italian people in our domain. They have suffered for too long at the hands of outside influences trying to extract wealth and prestige from them whilst being too weak to ever truly fight back. We will turn this around and give proper representation in the government to Lombards, Venetians, Ligurians, Neapolitans, Umbrians, and all others who can truly call themselves, 'Italian'."
 mlo_epitome_of_the_renaissance: "The Peak of the Renaissance"
 mlo_epitome_of_the_renaissance_desc: "Though we can't really define when the Renaissance started and ended, we can define the period of heightened cultural and scholarly output of the Italian Peninsula! Milan, Mantua, Venice, and several other cities thrived during this time and we will continue this emphasis on being where thinkers, musicians, poets, and artists flock to so that their work is spread far and wide."
 mlo_a_permanent_military_force: "From Mercenary Times Onwards"
 mlo_a_permanent_military_force_desc: "Condottieri have come and gone in the Italian Peninsula, but their legacy lives on in our military today. Several officers and commanders in Lombardy-Venetia are descendants of previous condottieri which means we do have a bit of mercenary blood in our ranks, but in order to prevail in the future, we will need to build a standing army. Slowly but surely, we will enacy steady reforms aimed at lessening our reliance on mercenary contracts and increasing our actual military potential."
 mlo_enlightened_rulership: "Enlightened Principles"
 mlo_enlightened_rulership_desc: "It is not enough to be held to the standards of French, Spanish, or German traditions of how leaders should rule; they rule with iron fists and edicts stemming from the heavens through the clergy, but we see the need for more concrete and rational principles in governance. We must rule for the benefit of not only wealthy merchants and nobles, but also for the good of our own people, and we also need to work on creating solidarity and trust between our commoners and our bureaucrats."

 mlo_rally_lombards_and_venetians_desc: "When the time comes for war against German soldiers, French cavalry, or Spanish ships, people will rally to the cause of Lombardy-Venetia. The noble flame carried forth by our grand union between Lombards and Venetians will not be put so easily by pompous kings and emperors from afar. The people of the Italian Peninsula know what they fight for is right and just, and the fight will burn into the dead of night should it need to."
 ven_influences_beyond_adriatic: "The Reach of the Venetians"
 ven_influences_beyond_adriatic_desc: "If it was not for the Republic of Venice and its great reach beyond the shores of the Italian Peninsula, would there be any power that thought of the Italians as viable threats? Most likely not! And it is because of this great reach that the Venetians cultivated that we are so connected throughout the Mediterranean Sea and beyond. In time, we are going to make more friends and allies who can aid Lombardy-Venetia in its endeavors and perhaps we can strike a trade deal or two with them."
 ven_trade_monopolies: "Mediterranean Trade Monopolies"
 ven_trade_monopolies_desc: "Securing trade monopolies is not an easy thing to do, but if anyone can do it, it is the people of Lombardy-Venetia. The mercantile skills of the Venetians combined with the martial prowess of the Lombards can easily net us a strong position if we need to make a violent entrance into a market, but even if we don't, the expertise of our merchants will slowly increase our trade power in all markets around Lombardy-Venetia."
 ven_naval_bases: "Expand our Arsenals"
 ven_naval_bases_desc: "To help keep our many trade routes safe, it would be wise for us to build up more arsenals and naval bases at our coastal holdings around the Adriatic and Mediterranean Sea. It will cut down on maintenance and also bolster our naval strength compared to the likes of other rival powers around us."
 ven_protect_what_is_ours: "Protected Assets"
 ven_protect_what_is_ours_desc: "Fending off rival merchants is a bit of risky task as it could easily lead to trade wars if state officials get involved from both sides. Still though, we are dedicated to ensuring that trade flowing into and out of Lombardy-Venetia is safe and secure so that our profit margins are where we want them to be; if we have to fight to secure our profits from foreign smugglers or raiders, then we will absolutely do so!"

 hxa_unite_the_scattered_cities: "Unite the Scattered Cities"
 hxa_unite_the_scattered_cities_desc: "The coasts of our land have scattered cities and villages, just as the mountains and hills do if one travels further inland. For far too long they've been without unity and without central guidance, but that is no more. We will build up these villages into towns, and we will build up infrastructure inside these towns and cities so that they can provide more manpower, taxes, and also produce more crops for our empire."
 hxa_central_religious_unity: "Destroy the Foreign Faiths"
 hxa_central_religious_unity_desc: "Foreigners might think of us having strange traditions that must be taken down, but we are much stronger than before. Our religious officials and devoted people have done much in the way of reforming religious rituals and traditions to the point where we can effectively enforce a unified state religion throughout the land. We will do as such through edicts and laws, and we will eradicate these foreign faiths that seek to erase what traditions have been passed down to us."
 hxa_workings_of_gold_and_jade: "Goldsmiths and Jade Artisans"
 hxa_workings_of_gold_and_jade_desc: "The lands of our people are rife with gold, jade, and other precious materials that many value for their quality and rarity. Because we have so much time to refine how we work these materials in terms of sculptures and artwork, many works we produce are traded across the world for high prices and some merchants even come back to our shores seeking more. It is this kind of mercantile and artisnal work that helps keep Huaxyacac in a position of prominence beyond its own shores."
 hxa_codices_of_our_history: "The Works of our History"
 hxa_codices_of_our_history_desc: "We have tried for centuries to keep track of our past with codices and writing, but our scattered languages and unrefined writing systems have produced more difficulties than possibilities for us. If we concentrate on working out a common writing system and a foramlized set of language for Huaxyacac as a whole, then we can track our history through works of writing and art with great precision and it will also help track the lineage of the royal family."
 zap_religious_heart_of_mitla: "Mitla, the Religious Heart"
 zap_religious_heart_of_mitla_desc: "The Zapotec people have had their high priest, the Uija-tao, stationed at Mitla. A place where Mixtec architectural styles mix with Zapotec styles in a beautiful display that is also the gateway between the world of the living and the world of the dead, Mitla is a place uniquely suited to be where our religious power comes from in our capital region. Priests and devoted followers of our faith will surely make regular trips to Mitla and we will recruit faithful followers there without question."
 zap_empire_building_once_again: "To Build Another Empire"
 zap_empire_building_once_again_desc: "Who is friend, and who is foe? The days of the Tlapanec, Mixtec, and most all the Zapotec people stretch back for centuries and in those old days, the Zapotec people cultivated perhaps the largest empire out of the three groups of people. Though it did not stretch far, it was very impactful on the people and they still strive for those days of being a truly dominant power in the region. If we are to build another empire, we must ensure we can have strong allies and small rivals whilst building up our internal domain through governors and advisors."
 zap_beyond_obsidian: "Fashioning New Weapons"
 zap_beyond_obsidian_desc: "The weaponry of our ancestors are no longer capable of winning battles and wars, for the days of obsidian arrows and spears are long gone. Now we must take to gunpowder weapons both large and small, building up a military that can effectively use them in battle against whatever enemy they encounter. We will prioritize our infantry in this matter since our homeland is not suited for masses of cannons or cavalry moving through the thick jungles and steep hills."
 mix_connect_the_city_states: "Roads through Huaxyacac"
 mix_connect_the_city_states_desc: "As we build up the infrastructure of our towns and cities, we will of course need proper roads to go between them all so that communication is much easier for both civilians and military officials. Simple dirt paths won't be enough through the jungles and hills of our region, no, Huaxyacac needs strong roads made of stone so that walking, running, or marching on said road is not a hazard in any sense."
 mix_learn_from_previous_battles: "Cultivating Endurance"
 mix_learn_from_previous_battles_desc: "Centuries of warfare in the jungles and hills of the region have hardened the Mixtec, Tlapanec, and Zapotec people. They know exactly what war brings to the land and to their own communities and they know exactly what precautions must be taken when the horns of war sound off. The struggles now may bring many to the point of death or close to it, but sacrifice right now will lead to success after the war is won."
 mix_refine_tribute_systems: "Taxation & Tribute"
 mix_refine_tribute_systems_desc: "The way taxes and tribute have been conducted and sent throughout the region in centuries past has led to tenuous holds on power since it was unorganized and fairly open to corruption. Now that we of Huaxyacac are fairly keen on centralizing things and reforming our economic potential, ensuring that our system of collecting taxes and tribute is able to function properly is what we need to focus on."
 tla_reformation_of_cotton_armor: "Beyond Cotton Armor"
 tla_reformation_of_cotton_armor_desc: "Cotton armor has been a consistent piece of armor throughout our region as it is light, flexible, easy to gain the ingredients, and can stop a variety of light attacks. Things are changing fast though and cotton armor is no longer capable of standing up to newer weapons. We need to employ new armor with new materials so that our troops can keep themselves safe in the heat of battle, or can at least survive a blow or two from being up close and personal."
 tla_endless_wars: "Endless War"
 tla_endless_wars_desc: "The fact that the Tlapanec, Zapotec, and Mixtec people have faced centuries of warfare not only internally, but also externally too means that the people are no stranger to what it is like to be called up for military service. Our training standards need to be more formalized and with better equipment so that any and all soldiers we enlist are ready when for battle at a quicker rate."
 tla_strong_internal_domain: "Strengthen our Foundations"
 tla_strong_internal_domain_desc: "The foundations of Huaxyacac can seem weak to outsiders and indeed to some officials they are still weak as of today. Reforming the way laws are passed and how local officials handle the enforcement of laws can give us a much stronger foundation since it will allow for us to have confidence that our local communities are providing what they can for the empire as a whole."

 the_two_domains: "The Two Domains"
 the_two_domains_desc: "England and France are both vast in their stretches of land and diverse in the people who fought for both. By uniting them together into one single political entity, we can combine the forces through various integrative efforts and make a unified military for the Angevin Realm itself, one that is proud, brave, and courageous enough to stand against the foes of Europe."
 inter_disciplinary_standards: "Inter-Disciplinary Standards"
 inter_disciplinary_standards_desc: "Across the Channel on both sides, the standards for military service may have been different in some senses, but they were also similar in other regards. By refining both and taking the best from both the English and the French ways of training and disciplining troops, those of the Angevin Realm can benefit from the highest quality training around."
 subjects_of_the_crowns: "Subjects of the Crowns"
 subjects_of_the_crowns_desc: "When Henry II was around to claim a majority of what is considered Angevin, there were several subject feudatories that held the realm together. Though we are more centralized now, we still rely on subject states here and there and as such should be ready to keep these subjects in line and loyal to the unified crown, whether by English or French means."
 english_channel_control: "Channel Control"
 english_channel_control_desc: "The heart of trade for us is quite obvious: the English Channel. It's a haven for trade and very profitable for us, and along with that, it has given us ample opportunity to refine our naval efforts and tactics, as well as giving us a safe gateway to the west and the east. It's our natural duty to ensure that our power propagates out from the English Channel and never fades from it."
 fertility_of_french_land: "Fertility of French Land"
 fertility_of_french_land_desc: "With the extremely fertile lands of France under our control, we can reform the agricultural practices over time and ensure an ample supply of food (as well as other resources) for our people. It might take some time to do, but it will be more than worth it in the end when the military and citizens of the Angevin Realm are well fed and prosperous."
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres: "Interlocked Administrative Cadres"
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres_desc: "With the unification of the crowns comes administrative questions and some are tougher to handle than others, but we are not without the will to overcome these obstacles. Cultivating a unified court between both the English and French will help us achieve this goal of an integrated and well connected administration, one that can manage the vast domains of the Angevin Realm."
 industrialization_measures: "Industrialization Measures"
 industrialization_measures_desc: "A new age is coming about, an age of new technologies and ideas that the people of the Angevin Realm are seeing as both dangerous and full of potential. It may be foolish of us to rush into this new age, but the benefits of its industrial techniques and new technologies are simply too good to pass up. Whatever problems come with entering this new age we will deal with, but industrial matters must become a central part of the Angevin Realm."

 pacify_the_berbers_desc: "Despite the numbers of Moroccans, Tunisians, and Algerians around North Africa, the Berbers are still very powerful and very influential in politics around the various areas we control. We must meet with them on equal terms and accept them as our own so that we do not invoke their ire. Should we turn our backs on the numerous Berber tribes in our borders, we could face a civil war the likes of which few have ever seen before."
 caliphate_status: "Caliphate Ideals"
 caliphate_status_desc: "The Caliphates of the past have stretched across the Maghreb in centuries past, leaving lasting influences on the various people that still remain in the Maghreb. Though some Islamic theologians preach different doctrines and ideals within our borders, we strive for something that nearly all within our borders agree with: the status of a being a caliphate. Like our ancestors of the Almohad and Fatimid Caliphates and our kin from the Rashidun, Corodoba, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates, we will follow in their footsteps and spread the word of the prophet Muhammad to all corners of our thriving nation."
 masterful_defenses: "Defensive Mastery"
 masterful_defenses_desc: "The ally of the Maghrebi people has always been defensive strategies since the arid land we inhabit is inherently hard to attack into. Where we live, the Christians of the north have strived to conquer before but have succumbed to the likes of the natural terrain whilst we were able to maintain ourselves in well placed defensive positions. Let us compound upon this mentality in the future and prepare even better defenses in the future for any invader who thinks that the Maghreb is an easy target for conquest."
 command_north_african_trade: "North African Trade"
 command_north_african_trade_desc: "The lucrative trade across North Africa is prized by many since it provides an alternative to the Christians across the sea. Not only this, but the Saharan trade routes also rely on trade routes throughout North Africa thus making our position even more lucrative. Capitalizing upon this and trying to make Maghrebi merchants and markets skilled and valuable will yield greater trade profits for the entirety of the region. If we're good enough at this, we might even be seen as a better alternative to the Christians in time!"
 maghrebi_guard: "Royal Maghrebi Guard"
 maghrebi_guard_desc: "We must not be as reliant on mercenaries and levied armies as much as we have before; the loyalty of these kinds of armies is fickle and prone to change when the tides of war change. The Maghreb must have its own professional, standing army that can help maintain the integrity of the entire nation better than any levied or mercenary-based army. This transition is going to take a fair amount of time and some groups within the Maghreb will not like this change, but we must be ready to adapt to the coming changes of the future."
 promote_barbary_pirates: "Corsair Traditions"
 promote_barbary_pirates_desc: "What else is the coast of the Maghreb known for? Piracy! Corsairs! Privateers! They've played a role in Maghrebi history for centuries now and have helped maintain the power of Maghrebi people against Christians to the north, therefore it is only natural that we would continue to fund and use them to our advantage. Let the coasts of our enemies and the merchant ships of our rivals know no peace!"
 formal_maghrebi_nation: "Formalize the Maghrebi Nation"
 formal_maghrebi_nation_desc: "Tribal confederacies and small kingdoms battling each other for dominance in battle, sometimes joining because of dynastic ties and breaking up because of petty disputes, the Maghreb has seen a very colorful history in this regard. This is, however, very much just that, history, for now we are ready to ascend to a new state that is beyond these squabbles and disputes. The dream of a united Maghreb is finally upon us and we must be ready to keep its administration in the best condition possible as it serves the people by promoting prosperity, growth, and unity."

From boyars to merchants to common citizens, they can and will be heard by the authorities of the land; they will be represented in our govenment when legislation is being passed and reforms are being made, and it is through them that Russia will be held up and propelled forward."
 system_of_tribute_and_taxes: "System of Tribute and Taxes"
 system_of_tribute_and_taxes_desc: "Through the legislative system of councils and magistrates in place, we can institute our republican values elsewhere. Though monarchs still thrive in this age, the ideals we hold as a republic can help mend and boost relations between us and our subjects who lie further away from the heart of the Russian Republic. Better this than enforcing harsh tribute on them and executing their officials on the spot for small matters, no, we must compromise and seek resolutions with them in a just and righteous way."
 strengthen_democratic_institutions: "Strengthen Republican Institutions"
 strengthen_democratic_institutions_desc: "We need not fall back into the times before the Veche was at our core, back to the days of princes and boyars running politics and abusing the peasants of the land like they were near slaves that they owned. Every adult Russian citizen in the Russian Republic must and will have a say in the legislative process. The council members as well as magistrates must adhere to the ideals we have had for decades now and we will be enforcing them at all possible points. It is through this triumph of republican values over the ones of monarchy that we will carve a future that is truly bright and glorious for the Russian people."
 beyond_the_urals: "Beyond the Urals"
 beyond_the_urals_desc: "The Ural Mountains were once the stopping point of the people of Novgorod; the tribes of the Urals had to pay tribute to Novgorod regularly though, times have certainly changed since they last paid tribute in that manner. We must now look past the Urals and toward the east where vast open swathes of land that can help maintain the strength of our republic and help ensure its prosperity for the future. Though the various tribes of the cold tundra and forests may resent us at first, they will learn to accept our authority over them."
 promoting_russian_arts: "Promote Russian Art"
 promoting_russian_arts_desc: "With several Eastern Orthodox Churches in our land as well as a magnificent cultural history backing the us up, it is no wonder that Russian art and architecture is able to flourish under us. The old days of monarchy restrained artistic styles at times, but we can become true patrons of many styles and develop a uniquely cultured feel to the landscape that few other nations can boast about. Not only this, but the marvelously built churches have also served to deepen the faith of our people, leading to more internal stability throughout Russian land."
 baltic_dominance: "Baltic Dominance"
 baltic_dominance_desc: "The Neva River and its bay have been crucial for trade opportunities and also for the Russian navy to get its start. The Baltic may traditionally be home to the Swedes, the Danish, and the Finnish, but the Russians are now becoming a key player too thanks to a multitude of factors. If we can secure more Baltic trade for ourselves and expand our shipyards further along the coast, we'll be able to reap control away from the pesky Scandinavians."
 reformed_military_standards: "Reformed Military Standards"
 reformed_military_standards_desc: "To defend the Russian Republic will require the utmost discipline and fighting power. We are not so entrenched in the past that we are going to fire arrows at our enemies who fire lead shot back at us, instead we will readily adopt the new firearms being used by other powers and incorporate them into our military so that they can use the new military standards devised in conjunction with modern weaponry. If we let our military become decadent, we risk losing the entire republic from war itself."

 dismantle_coastal_forts_desc: "The coasts of our adversaries are being fortified as it is against our efforts but this will not stand for long. We need to strengthen the weaponry on our ships and train our sailors better so that they can more effectively take down fortification after fortification from a distance. None near the water will be able to withstand the might of the Wokou for long!"
 force_open_trade_routes: "Force Open Trade Routes"
 force_open_trade_routes_desc: "The Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans are continually trying to block all trade with us. Few families and clans are willing to open their trade routes to us, meaning that many of our markets are starved of (shady) customers and merchants alike. This must be put to and end somehow; we must force open these trade routes by any means so that we can feel the blood that is trade flow smoothly again."
 command_the_waters: "Commanding the Waters"
 command_the_waters_desc: "The seas and open waters are valuable to many from all over the regions around us. Plenty of trading potential and power to be gained from controlling these waters, right? Well then we should capitalize on our already shady presence and make sure that the waters stretching from Northern Japan to Southern China are ours and only ours!"
 repurpose_enemy_ships: "Repurpose Enemy Ships"
 repurpose_enemy_ships_desc: "Not all of our enemies ships are useless once we defeat them, this is a simple fact we need to observe. Along with this, our own docks and harbors are not as high quality as those of China, Japan, or Korea, thus our capability to build ships is much more limited than many others around us. If we can effectively repair captured enemy ships and man them with enough sailors loyal to the Wokou, we can bolster our fleet numbers without nearly as much effort or resource spent."
 gunpowder_convoy_raids: "Gunpowder Convoy Raids"
 gunpowder_convoy_raids_desc: "Gunpowder is shipped around the waters we inhabit regularly and along coastal routes without end, meaning these transport routes are easily open to raids by our sailors and military. The more gunpowder we raid for and store up, the more firepower we will have later on for our ships and for our military, both of which we will need if we are to sustain our grip on power."
 multi_ethnic_formation: "The Many Wokou"
 multi_ethnic_formation_desc: "The Wokou are not just one simply population of people of Japanese, Korean, or Chinese descent, but rather it is an amalgamation of people from various cultural groups who have come together to take on a new life, one that promises better treatment and opportunity than what their previous life offered. Even the ones we capture eventually come around to joining the Wokou and with all these cultures within our ranks, it'd be wise for us to unite with them rather than discriminate against them."
 age_of_the_wokou: "The Age of the Wokou"
 age_of_the_wokou_desc: "They fight to keep us down, but the spirit and might of the Wokou cannot be tamed so easily. We do not readily submit to foreign authority like we all once had before and we will continually strive for an age where we are in charge. The age of the Wokou will come forth in some form or another, or we will die trying to see it through."

 cnut_the_greats_empire_desc: "The forebearer of our great empire, Cnut the Great, united the crowns of the Denmark, England, and Norway into one single political entity that was decentralized to a good degree. Following in Cnut's footsteps, we should not mistreat the churches or locals of the lands we conquer but instead slowly but surely bring the laws of Denmark upon them. Integration rather than straight and bloody conquest and the pillaging of each and every house we find is what we need."
 rulers_of_the_north_sea: "Rulers of the North Sea"
 rulers_of_the_north_sea_desc: "The North Sea is a prosperous and vital place that many ships cross through for trade and combat. Taking control of it entirely is what allowed the North Sea Empire of our ancestors to thrive and exert control over vast stretches of land. Our resurgent control of the North Sea will only serve to help propel our naval power to the ends of the Earth."
 divide_and_rule: "Divide and Rule"
 divide_and_rule_desc: "The concept of 'divide and conquer/rule' is not a new one since the it has been employed in the times of the Greeks and Romans from centuries before. The North Sea Empire is perhaps another beneficiary of such a political outline since dividing up our lands and our territories into certain departments, provinces, and sectors can ease the burden on our administration as a whole."
 fierce_norse_fighters: "Ferocity of Norse Fighters"
 fierce_norse_fighters_desc: "Norse fighters, from the lands of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, are renowned for their ferocity and might. Though not the most disciplined or the most technologically advanced at times, they were universally seen as fearsome and courageous warriors that were to be feared. This legacy lives on in the blood of our soldiers to this very day and we will see to it that they fight with the same valor as people from our lands did in centuries past!"
 english_administrative_structures: "Comprehensive Administration"
 english_administrative_structures_desc: "The English have developed certain administrative structures and techniques that Denmark well, has struggled to develop over the decades. Mired by political struggles in the north and south, we could can and should incorporate some of the English techniques of administration into our own so that we can better manage the vast swathes of land in the North Sea Empire."
 enforce_danelaw: "Rekindle and Expand the Danelaw"
 enforce_danelaw_desc: "The Danelaw was both an administrative structure used by the Danes from the 880s onward (after the formalization of the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum in 886) and a term for where the Danes took control of and held sway in the British Isles. It is only right that the North Sea Empire revive the Danelaw and refine it over time, bringing the Isles closer into fold of the Danes and more prosperous as a whole."
 might_of_the_north_sea_empire: "The Might of the North Sea"
 might_of_the_north_sea_empire_desc: "From the mighty northern waters, fjords, and coasts is where we of the North Sea Empire shall descend upon the world. Our military and navy will be ready to fend off any invasion into our lands and after the pikes of our enemies shatter upon our shields, we will repay them for what they did with added interest.

External forces have helped push us in this direction undoubtedly and it is felt by all who assemble by the Seven Council Fires that strength and determination must come through unity. Through this unity, we will expand our borders outward and make allies out of the other tribal people we come to encompass."
 councils_of_the_nakota: "The Wichiyena Councils"
 councils_of_the_nakota_desc: "The Wichiyena (otherwise known as the Nakota though this is a misnomer) encompass the Yankton and Yanktonai peoples and their history as the middle Sioux has been integral to the very heart of our confederacy. Unlike the other councils, they are less oriented to warfare and are more keen on internal matters like societal cohesion as opposed to making new warrior societies. It is with the words of these two that the nation will thrive with administrative prowess."
 reformation_of_sioux_politics: "Reform the Political Structure"
 reformation_of_sioux_politics_desc: "The previous tribal makeup of the Sioux people has had a lasting effect on relations at all levels of society. From small-scale communities to previous chiefs who are now leaders with different titles, tribal feuds and debts are still seen as playing a large part in our politics and it makes for a great number of messy endeavors, unfortunately. By making a concentrated effort to make sure these old feuds and debts are repaid and resolved, we can ensure that the nation is strong at its very core."
 councils_of_the_lakota: "The Teton Councils"
 councils_of_the_lakota_desc: "The Teton (otherwise known as the Lakota) most disciplined and war-like group within our nation. Comprising of three councils (the Northern, Central, and Southern Lakota) and showing just how fierce they are when fighting other people on the plains, it should come as no surprise that they wield a great amount of influence. Balancing out their power and influence with the others is key, and utilizing their adaptation to the changing technologies of warfare will serve to help modernize us as a whole."
 plains_warfare: "Ruthless Plains Warfare"
 plains_warfare_desc: "The Great Plains is where the bison roam and where several people groups come to clash over hunting grounds and territorial rights. We are no stranger to this at all, and with the dawn of the age of gunpowder weapons well upon us, it would do us well to utilize this power on horseback and on foot. The shock of cavalry charges and long range skirmishing on either horseback or on foot will serve to drive out any enemy of the Seven Council Fires."
 councils_of_the_dakota: "The Santee Councils"
 councils_of_the_dakota_desc: "The Santee (otherwise known as the Dakota) have brought their experience in from the east when they were defeated by the Ojibwe people around Lake Superior. The integration of their traditions and customs from outside the Great Plains has helped our nation become more welcoming of outsiders, though that does not mean we will let foreigners seize land from us unfairly. What happened to the Santee will not happen to us and we will be sure of it."
 seven_fires_to_light_our_way: "Seven Fires Light the Way"
 seven_fires_to_light_our_way_desc: "As we look to the future, it is very much a shroud of fog that we can't see past. Some are scared of what lurks behind the fog, could disaster await the Sioux people? Or could there be a great age of Sioux expansion and prosperity? Whatever is waiting for us in the future, the Seven Council Fires will be there to light the way for a strong, unified, and capable people.

 meritocratic_military_ranks: "Ranks of the Nahua"
 meritocratic_military_ranks_desc: "The Aztecs and those around them blessed the greater region of Nahua people with military skills, but corruption in the form of noble bloodlines and wealthy individuals seeking to buy ranks in the military are what hold us back. Let us embark on a path that leads to a more skillful and merit-based military ranking system that relies on actual fighting technique and military knowledge."

Now the task is to spread forth, claim what lands are rightfully ours, and bring forth a new age of dominance stemming from our heartland."
 refine_the_tributary_system: "New Nahua Tributaries"
 refine_the_tributary_system_desc: "The way warfare was back during the time of Aztec dominance in the region led to subjugation of smaller alteptls, exacting tribute from them in the form of slaves, prisoners-of-war, or food and resources. Now that times have changed, we must take to refining that old way of warfare and subjugation whilst also instituting a more structured way of exacting tribute from our subjects."
 cultivation_of_harsh_land: "Cultivation of Harsh Land"
 cultivation_of_harsh_land_desc: "The jungles and highlands of our native region are not the easiest to make do with. We have managed to build great buildings and grand farming structures sure, but with new technology and ideas coming into our society at a consistent rate, we would be better off cultivating the land with more advanced methods. Chinampas and other farming methods, as an example, could be vastly improved with the new equipment we have been able to obtain."
 currency_transition: "Minting Nahua Coinage"
 currency_transition_desc: "The currency of the international markets is not what our ancestors would have used at all. Whilst our military traditions are stronger than many others, our finances are going to lag behind if we cannot start minting our own coins and controlling the flow of money into and out of Nahua territory. Thus, a large scale endeavor will be needed to start this process, but we will get it done in time."

 write_the_yukars: "Writing of the Yukars"
 write_the_yukars_desc: "Great stories of heroism and sorrow, people from our past and spirits along our path, these are what the yukars tell of. Spoken in our own language for as long as we can remember, these Yukars have made us masters of narration and memory as time has gone on. But with each death of an Ainu elder, a library of information is lost with them and we cannot recover everything from their death. Thus, we should begin writing down these Yukars for future generations to read instead of relying purely on oral testimony from generation to generation."
 bring_back_what_japan_once_was: "Jomon Land Once Again"
 bring_back_what_japan_once_was_desc: "Long ago, the Jomon people roamed the lands of Japan without fear and lived off the land freely. Then, as one of our Yukar tells, the Children of the Sun came and began settling on the lands of Japan and eventually stirring tensions with the Jomon people. Though the Jomon people eventually lost this great struggle over the centuries, their descendants that are us, the Ainu people, are now able to reclaim the land that they lost gradually. The Wajin/Yayoi (old name for Japanese people) will know firsthand the atrocities they inflicted upon our people."
 reprisal_against_the_wajin: "Reprisal Against the Wajin"
 reprisal_against_the_wajin_desc: "The Wajin have waged wars and dealt horrible losses to the Ainu people both in the recent and distant past; they care not for our lives or culture. Just as they have done to us in the past, we will do to them and inflict harrowing losses on the Wajin in open combat. Whether it is by the shrines they hold dear or the castles they build to protect themselves, the Wajin and any others in Japan will fall to our people."
 judged_by_others_in_the_community: "Refine the Judgement of People"
 judged_by_others_in_the_community_desc: "Traditionally, Ainu communities judged crimes via communal judgement. Various amounts of people could gather in and help decide what should be done to a criminal, but we are finding this system to be too unwieldy for our growing state. If we can set up a strong court system that takes some notes from how the Wajin structured their legal system, the Ainu people can build up a robust set of rules and laws that effectively deal with crimes and people who commit said crimes."
 the_kamuy_guide_us_to_war: "The Kamuy and Warfare"
 the_kamuy_guide_us_to_war_desc: "Our traditional religion entails animism to a large degree. Kamuy Fuchi, goddess of the hearth, Kim-un- Kamuy, the god of bears and mountains, Repun Kamuy, god of the sea, and Kotan-kar-kamuy, the creator of the world, are just some of the the spirits that are encompassed in the term 'kamuy'. Through our transformations as a people, the Kamuy have come to symbolize a great many things for the Ainu people, but with the sounds of war never far off, we must seek out what answers the kamuy have in regards to conflict with our neighbors. Through their guidance, we will be able to establish a strong faith for the Ainu people in times of peace and in times of war."
 chasi_forts_secure_trade: "Chashi for our Trade Routes"
 chasi_forts_secure_trade_desc: "Hill forts in our land, traditionally called 'Chashi', have been around for a long time and they served to protect vital areas of trade (which were usually along the banks of nearby rivers). These fortifications can prove to be even more useful if we build them up further with new defensive measures like strong stone walls and intricate garrison systems, similar to what the Wajin use in their own lands."
 unify_the_ainu_people: "Unify the Ainu"
 unify_the_ainu_people_desc: "To unite all of the scattered Ainu people is a tough task as many are on remote islands or have not contacted us in ages. We must reach out to them instead with our own officials and soldiers ready to greet them with warm smiles and gifts of food and materials. Once we've incorporated all the Ainu settlements into our domain, we can still use this expansionist policy toward other places that are relatively unorganized and unclaimed; the legacy of the Ainu people will reach to where the sun sets and where the sun rises!"

 ainu_wajin_feud_settling_desc: "Whilst we do not exactly like the Wajin and what they've done to our ancestors that were the Jomon and the Emishi people, we realize that we cannot exactly live without what they have built up. If we work to settle past feuds on the local level and also work to incorporate the Wajin into our administration alongside our own people, we'll be able to pass much more effective laws and regulations throughout our republic."
 representation_of_all_in_ezo: "Represent All in Ezo"
 representation_of_all_in_ezo_desc: "Some may not exactly be keen on representing all the people in Ezo, but many upper level officials realize that not representing the various people in Ezo will lead to a great amount of unrest that will help topple our government. Our strength not only comes from the Ainu people, but also from the other people in Ezo and ensuring that they are taken care of by our administration; this republican ideal is exactly what will help us keep our cohesive state together for ages without end."

Through our transformations as a people, the Kamuy are becoming more of a symbol of our steadfast nature as a people and how great our endurance is despite outside influences from Buddhism and Shintoism. The Kamuy shall show us a bright future, one where peace is had through words and writing instead of through constant bloodshed."
 to_defend_ezo_itself: "In Defense of Ezo"
 to_defend_ezo_itself_desc: "Ezo must be defended at all costs, it is as simple as that. Our home must have a honored military guard and a strong navy the likes of which our previous generations of people have never seen before. Guardians of our land will stand ready for whatever strikes out from the sea, and when we claim land through conquest, we will ensure that it is maintained as a vital territory similar to how our capital is."

 through_talk_and_blood_desc: "The word of the prophet must spread to all corners of the world, as most Muslims already know, but the lands of Lusong and nearby islands are rife with beliefs that are heterodox to what is recorded in the Quran. Whether it is through gentle persuasion and knowledge sharing or through religious wars of great bloodshed, we will spread Islam to the the various islands that Lusong will come to control and there will be unity amongst the people."
 multiple_hearts_of_trade: "Multiple Hearts of Trade"
 multiple_hearts_of_trade_desc: "The lands of Tondo, Madyas, Cebu, and other places in our home islands are great centers of trade and commerce. They have been this way for centuries what with merchants from the west and north coming to these tropical paradises to do business, and now that we are unified into a single political entity, there is nothing stopping us from profiting even more from these centers of trade! Come, let us build up a few more structures in these cities and build them up higher so that the money never stops flowing into Lusong!"
 muslim_merchant_fleets: "Armed Muslim Merchants"
 muslim_merchant_fleets_desc: "The waters around us are dangerous for Muslims and they have been for generations now. Buddhist, Hindu, and sometimes even Christian ships float around these islands and are willing to contest Muslims for trade rights throughout the entire region. It is time that we fight back and arm the Muslim merchants of Lusong with gunpowder weapons and techniques that stem from the great bastions of Islam in the west like Persia and Arabia."
 protected_coasts_of_lusong: "Protections of Lusong"
 protected_coasts_of_lusong_desc: "The tropical paradises Lusong holds as its own are not just a joy to visit and do business inside of, but they are also quite hard to take via invasion. We are building up the defensive structures around these centers of trade, yes, but they are also situated in a region that is plagued by heavy rains, tropical diseases, and rough landing spots if they aren't landing at a designated port or harbor. Keeping these factors in mind and playing our defense around these defensive tactics will ensure that few invaders will be able to even touch the walls of our cities."
 expertise_in_mercantile_matters: "A History of Expertise"
 expertise_in_mercantile_matters_desc: "From the time of the 700s and 800s, Muslim merchants sailed far and wide in the Indian Ocean to not only spread the word of Islam, but also to make money and do business wherever they could. Such a legacy of expertise in mercantile matters is something we have in our blood and we will use it as much as possible to bring in greater profits."
 more_and_more_islands: "The Nation of Islands"
 more_and_more_islands_desc: "Our heritage lies not only in being a nation of traders and sialors, no, the other key element in our heritage is being a nation of islanders as well. Our home islands, connected by a common sense of culture and religion, hold immense power within them and we only need to channel it through strong and righteous authority our own people. Once we have done this, we can look toward other islands where our kin have settled upon and bring them into the fold, or perhaps even sail off and find new land for people of Lusong to inhabit."
 influx_of_muslims_scholars: "The Muslims Bastion of the East"
 influx_of_muslims_scholars_desc: "We are perhaps the furthest bastion of islam there is, far from the deserts of Arabia and mountains of Persia. This gives us a unique place in the world of Islam as, though there are several other sultans and emirs to our west, they do not have the perspective nor the connections that we have. In time, this reputation as being the 'eastern bastion of Islam' will garner us more scholars of Islam and we will utilize them as much as possible in our court."
 indianization_of_the_islands: "Ancient Influences..."
 indianization_of_the_islands_desc: "The culture of the subcontinent, the traditions of Hinduism, and the legacy that was imparted onto us from the days of the Chola Empire... All of these have come together into the nation we are today. Various facets of our culture are undeniably influenced by the grand and extensive history of Indian culture spreading throughout the islands of Southeast Asia and it is through this Indianization that many new ideas were imparted onto our people centuries ago. Such a history of cultural change and innovation via cultural exchange is what we can foster as we go forth into the future."
 bastion_of_brahmic_tradition: "Bastion of Hinduism"
 bastion_of_brahmic_tradition_desc: "As Islam and Buddhism fire arrows at each other and do battle over the various islands of Southeast Asia, Hinduism has found a safe haven in the likes of Lusong. These islands have known a number of traditions in the past and are still home to small pockets of Muslims, Buddhists, and Anito followers, but we are not going to impose harsh restrictions on them. Though Hinduism may be dominant in our administration and various cities, we are willing to come to terms with these other faiths."
 promote_further_indianization: "... Renewed in Lusong"
 promote_further_indianization_desc: "Even though Lusong can feel the influences from ancient times, that does not mean it should simply shrug them off and keep them only to Lusong. Indianization spread to many, many islands and areas all throughout Southeast Asia in past centuries, it is only right that they come back to the tradition that gave many of these cultures initial footing so long ago."
 dominate_nusantara: "Calls to War"
 dominate_nusantara_desc: "Much like how we refused to accept the dominance of foreigners on our own shores, there are those around the lands of Southeast Asia who refuse to accept the dominance of Lusong soldiers and sailors in their land. We will need to strengthen our resolve and build up our forces if we are to take over our rivals in the regions around us since many would see the light of the Brahmic tradition in the east snuffed out altogether."
 confucian_buddhist_trade: "Trade from the North"
 confucian_buddhist_trade_desc: "The northern trade routes from the Chinese and from the Vietnamese and Cham people are lucrative in what they provide. Various riches and luxury goods flowing into our markets whilst at the same time giving us a mercantile template to follow for ages to come, there are many merchants in Lusong that are trying to emulate the soft dominance that was projected into Lusong's northern area from ages ago."
 harmony_with_other_faiths: "Inter-Faith Peace"
 harmony_with_other_faiths_desc: "There is no use in trying to enforce the practices of Buddhism and Confucianism through heavy-handed trading measures, it will only invoke harsh reprisals against us in the future. Instead, we should attempt to come to peace with other people of various faiths so that we can have a much more honorable and reputable name in the numerous markets around us."
 gunpowdcer_from_the_north: "Gunpowder Imports"
 gunpowdcer_from_the_north_desc: "Gunpowder is no longer a secret held by just the Chinese and the innovations that those around us have made with gunpowder are absolutely astounding. Adopting it as quickly as we can for our soldiers and sailors will give them the power they need both on land and at sea to fend off rival armies and navies, but we will always need to refine the tactics we use with gunpowder weapons so that we do not become stagnant in our military capabilities."
 tributaries_of_our_own: "Tributaries of Lusong"
 tributaries_of_our_own_desc: "Much like how the various states of Southeast Asia adopted tributary states instead trying to directly annex land, we of Lusong will adopt this route as well. Having a network of tributary states can be much more beneficial to Lusong since they still provide yearly influxes of various materials whilst also projecting the influence of Lusong into various other regions we are in."
 encompass_all_of_the_archipelago: "The Efforts of All Islands"
 encompass_all_of_the_archipelago_desc: "There are several places in our state that hold beliefs that are strange to the usual Anito way of thinking about spirituality and life, but we do not come at these different faiths with hostility. The Lusong administration is going to work with these communities of people so that they do not feel alienated in the land they've regarded as home for generations; in time, their efforts will be gathered with all others inside Lusong and there will be a unified military and navy that can defend our state regardless of what happens."
 masterful_sailors: "Masterful Sailors"
 masterful_sailors_desc: "Home to great sailors and merchants, others might perceive Lusong as perhaps no different to those of Sumatra and Java but this is far from the truth. The difference with us lies in just how well we can master the waves and wind around us with regards to sailing, and when fights break out between hostile ships and our own, our sailors are more than capable of punching above their weight. It is time that we put these sailors to good use in a unified Lusong fleet."
 harbors_and_naval_bases: "Harbors, Docks, and Naval Bases"
 harbors_and_naval_bases_desc: "The nature of Lusong as a state makes having good places to dock ships a priority. The more we build in terms of harbors for trade, docks for building ships, and naval bases for securing territory, the more Lusong will prosper as a whole. Few can boast just how much of a vital position we are in with regards to being able to field a massive fleet of ships, and few will ever be able to match our strength in this regard."
 fertility_and_unity: "Prosperity from Unity"
 fertility_and_unity_desc: "Through the collective efforts of all Lusong people regardless of their religious adherence, we are seeing a new age of prosperity and prestige. Villages are expanding, coastal towns and cities are becoming larger than ever, and the productive potential in our land is higher than ever before. If we can keep up this sense of unity in the face of new threats on the horizon, Lusong will be able to become stronger than any other power in Southeast Asia."

It is our duty to reunite the lost Anishinaabe people back into the Council of Three Fires and become whole once more in the face of incoming hardship from the east."
 ojibwe_tempered_ambition: "Tempered Ambition"
 ojibwe_tempered_ambition_desc: "The ambition of the our older brother, the Ojibwe, is strong and akin to that of fires in a great raid, yet they have been pushed back time and time again along with the rest of the Anishinaabe people. If we can manage the ambitions of old and new together and formulate proper plans for the future, we can efficiently wage wars of conquest in the future."

 potawatomi_seven_grandfather_teachings_desc: "Carried forth from generations past to the present are the Seven Grandfather Teachings from our Younger Brother, the Potawatomi. Each child in our nation learns these teachings: wisdom, respect, love, honesty, humility, bravery, and truth toward each other and all creation, though we do try to keep them on the righteous path when they go off course as some inevitably do. It is these teachings that help ground the Anishinaabe people and help keep the peace within our grand state."

Despite what others might think of us, the Ottawa do a great job at representing Anishinaabe interests in markets all around us."

 ojibwe_keepers_of_the_faith_desc: "The keepers of our traditional faith are the Ojibwe and they take great care in the rituals performed as well as the materials used.

Though they are perhaps the meekest of all of us, they are also perhaps the most vital to keeping our internal structure of cooperation, development, and political unity intact. As we grow, prosper, and expand outward, the Potawatomi will be there at every step of the way keeping our fires lit, our path bright, and our people uplifted."
 ottawa_keepers_of_trade: "The Ottawa, Keepers of Trade"
 ottawa_keepers_of_trade_desc: "And as our influence spreads forth, the keepers of trade that are the Ottawa will be there to ensure that markets far outside of our territory still feel the prosperous influence of Anishinaabe merchants. There is a great amount of money to be made as we expand our trade routes and avenues for production, we just need to channel this money through the Ottawa."

It stands approximately 260 ft. tall with an octagonal base of about 97 ft., and it is built mostly out of white porcelain bricks to reflect the sun's rays during the day.

It is a center of trade for many cities surrounding it, it is situated in a great location for development, and it can have defensive positions built around it as time goes on. Not only this, but it has been used as capital for a number of previous great dynasties of the Middle Kingdom, giving it a reputation unlike many other cities around us.

 the_sichuan_dialect_desc: "Long ago, before the likes of the Qin Dynasty, the Sichuan basin was very distinct in culture and language from the rest of the Middle Kingdom and its plethora of slightly different forms of Chinese culture. It was not until the Sichuan people were annexed that they became mixed together with Chinese culture as a whole, yet there remains a distinct identity for Sichuanese people, especially those living in Xijing. Our dialect is quite unique when compared to other places such as Luoyang or Suzhou and it is this facet of our culture that will make us stand out as a truly unique contender for the Mandate of Heaven."

Whilst the name 'Sichuan' itself may stem more from the name 'Four Plain Circuits' as opposed to 'Four Rivers', these rivers provide deal of irrigation and productivity to the land in and around our capital city.

Though there have been multiple times where the defenses at the edge of the basin were broken by a variety of forces, we will ensure that refugees who are currently looking for a place to hold out in will find Xijing and its surrounding land as a new home. All we ask for is partial military service so long as they are living within our territory."

 foreign_entries_of_the_south_desc: "We are on one of the frontiers of Chinese culture, more or less, due to the fact that we border the Viet, Zhuang, and other non-Chinese cultures to our west and south. Though we do skirmish with some of them at our border, we shouldn't be so keen on annexing all of them as quick as we can since it will be hard to administrate such dense tropical terrain from afar. Instead, we should welcome the foreigners and keep up diplomatically with them, slowly bringing them into our fold as the years go by."
 new_center_of_chinese_growth: "New Center of Growth"
 new_center_of_chinese_growth_desc: "There are some who would doubt the prospects of a thriving southern state in the entirety of the Middle Kingdom, but we are living proof that it can happen with enough unity and strength. Our example is bringing more and more people to our cause and soon enough, we'll have soldiers from every major city in the Middle Kingdom under our banners. Can any other state say that with confidence?"
 more_than_dangerous_trading: "Dangerous Waters"
 more_than_dangerous_trading_desc: "The waters of the east toward Suzhou and Beijing are safer than the waters around Guangzhou. We must contend with traders who speak radically different languages and practice a myriad of religions, meaning that piracy, smugglers, and coastal raiders are a much larger threat for us. We are not without our own tactics, however, as we can just as easily turn these tricks on our enemies via utilizing our fleet in a number of ways. Trade is good and all, but when it is being undermined by foreigners who do not care for trade, we will force them to care."
 migrations_southward_from_northern_chaos: "Migrations to the South"
 migrations_southward_from_northern_chaos_desc: "To migrate across the Middle Kingdom so that you may find safety is not new at all. Past fractures of power have made migrations necessary for many groups of people, meaning different areas get an influx of manpower and productive potential. The current state of politics in the Middle Kingdom is spurring on a migration as it is though perhaps it is not as large as previous ones. Still it is granting us a great amount of military potential that we can use in our efforts to push northward."
 amends_with_the_western_expanse: "Amending with the Zhuang"
 amends_with_the_western_expanse_desc: "The Zhuang people to our west, along with a variety of other smaller groups of people, have been disconnected from the rest of the Middle Kingdom for centuries. Though some consider them to be Chinese, their language and culture is far from being anything like that of the Sichuanese or Cantonese. We must rein these scattered people in through a coordinated and peaceful process so that we have a larger base of power to draw from in the future, and a secure western flank."
 the_capital_of_guangzhou: "The Capital of Guangzhou"
 the_capital_of_guangzhou_desc: "Naturally a port for traders and a city for eager merchants, Guangzhou is quickly becoming the epicenter of our state and the entire region that surrounds it. Keeping up with trade practices and protecting what water ways we can so that merchants always feel welcome and safe in Guangzhou will propel the city upwards and bring unprecedented amounts of prosperity to it. In time, it may even pass the likes of Nanjing or Beijing in terms of wealth."

 robust_northern_bueracracy: "Robust Northern Bueracracy"
 robust_northern_bueracracy_desc: "The north has always been a haven for bureaucracy and administration since Xi'an, Luoyang, and Beijing have been traditional seats of power for previous dynasties. Ancient roots are found within these cities and these ancient roots still give life to grand advisors alongside strong administrators who know exactly how to enforce laws that get passed. If our enemies are deprived of such good bureaucrats, they surely will not last long in this world."
 on_the_northern_frontier: "Frontier of the North"
 on_the_northern_frontier_desc: "We border the harsh lands of the Mongols and Jurchens to the north and northeast. Though they feud over their own politics and pay little attention to us at times, we cannot count on them being disunited forever. We need to build up our defenses along the Great Wall and renovate it as much as we can so that we can hold out against any northern invasion in the future."
 recruit_nomadic_mercenaries: "Deals with the Steppe Nomads"
 recruit_nomadic_mercenaries_desc: "And just as we make preparations to defend against Mongols and Jurchens alike, we must also be ready to negotiate mercenary contracts with them should those times come. Our traditional enemies are feared with their bows and horses and we could use them in certain conflicts throughout the Middle Kingdom, we just need to pick and choose where they might be most effective."
 imperial_military_prepartions: "Imperial Military Preparations"
 imperial_military_prepartions_desc: "Our ascendance to imperial authority is slowly coming about and soon enough, the entire Middle Kingdom will be under our control. Though, in order to properly do conquests inside and outside the Middle Kingdom, we are going to need a truly imperial military that is organized and well supplied with munitions and materials. Ensuring these logistics are taken care of will help ease the burden of financially managing our troops in the future."
 strict_military_divisions: "Strict Military Divisions"
 strict_military_divisions_desc: "Utilizing our preparations from before and also drawing on some past wisdom from previous dynasties and the strategies they used, we will begin putting these divisions of regiments into use with a distinct focus on infantry. They are the lifeblood of our state and will be what carries us to ultimate victory over the other states in the Middle Kingdom."
 the_capital_of_beijing: "The Capital of Beijing"
 the_capital_of_beijing_desc: "Being founded so long ago and holding so many wondrous buildings inside of it, including the famed Forbidden City, there are few cities that can stand up to the prestige that Beijing radiates outward. It will once again be the heart of administration in the entirety of the Middle Kingdom, and it will be where the Son of Heaven rests with the Imperial Mandate."

 the_whole_of_zhongguo_desc: "Some said it would be impossible for us; others said it was a foolish endeavor to try to unite the various states of the Middle Kingdom into one political entity, but alas we have proven them all wrong! The culmination of power, authority, and prosperity is under our authority with no other being able to contest our claim to the Mandate of Heaven or the whole of the Middle Kingdom. This message will ring loud and clear for all people of the land to hear as people gather to our banners to defend what is rightfully ours."
 an_end_to_warring_states: "The End to the Warring States"
 an_end_to_warring_states_desc: "Swords and spears, muskets and arrows, all forms of weaponry were utilized to try to gain power amongst the warring states, but it seems that it was only thanks to our hard work both in the field of battle and at the negotiating table that peace was able to come back to the Middle Kingdom. The heavens have blessed us with the strength to get to this point, now it is time for us to honor the heavens through our good deeds and offerings and also give back to the people through meticulous and careful planning from the top down."
 reclaiming_ancient_heritage: "Reclaiming our Ancient Heritage"
 reclaiming_ancient_heritage_desc: "The Xia Dynasty is mythical in many respects, but for most people in our lands the Xia Dynasty is where the Chinese people started their rise to greatness. Whether they speak one dialect or another, they still work to contribute toward the greater tree of Chinese culture that has blossomed from the very seeds planted by the Xia Dynasty. It is time that this heritage of ours was properly reclaimed and examined with a keen and patient set of eyes."
 two_crownings_and_three_respects: "The Two Crownings and Three Respects"
 two_crownings_and_three_respects_desc: "Unlike what some foreigners might think of our dynastic rises and falls from the past, the new dynasty that comes to power usually gives powerful positions to the old royal family so that said old royalty are not shunned from society or sent off into exile. Indeed they still hold sway in some circles even after being taken down from power and indeed we of the Later Xia will enact just such a policy to those were previously in power."
 splendor_of_ancestor_veneration: "Veneration of our Ancestors"
 splendor_of_ancestor_veneration_desc: "Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism influences the various lives of our citizens in a myriad of ways, but if there is one constant throughout our entire history it is the fact that we respect and honor our ancestors no matter what. These traditions should not be shunned away as new ideas come into our land, but rather these traditions should be enshrined as part of our grand heritage and made to show just how much we pay attention to our past."
 empowered_by_the_stories: "Empowering Heroism"
 empowered_by_the_stories_desc: "The past is rife with tales of heroism, bravery, and great figures of both moral goodness and spiritual goodness. These classic and ancient tales, especially those from the Xia Dynasty in our ancient past, should be preserved as much as possible and perhaps made into live plays so that not only are our citizens inspired, but also so that our military are inspired. If we can adopt the heroic attitude and courage that some of these mythical figures had, who knows just how far we could get in future wars."
 the_finality_of_the_middle_kingdom: "The Finality of the Xia"
 the_finality_of_the_middle_kingdom_desc: "Some in our court think of our coming about as a sort of fulfillment of the past. They see us, the Later Xia, as the finality of the Middle Kingdom and the embodiment of old traditions revived with new and grand ideas. Whether or not this is actually true is up for debate, but we should not relax now and take things easy just because our courtiers say nice things about us. We should use this up-and-coming reputation as a way to strengthen ourselves from the inside out, cultivating a developed and structured state that can defend itself no matter what happens."

 ZSG_ideas_bonus: "Shang Ambition"
 legacy_of_the_oracle_bones: "Legacy of the Oracle Bones"
 legacy_of_the_oracle_bones_desc: "The Shang Dynasty of old was very intent on divining answers from oracle bones. Questions submitted to deities would be submitted via carvings into bonues or shells and the subsequent cracks on the bones/shells would be what determines the answers to the questions (interpreted by a skilled person of course). Whilst we do not practice such rituals anymore, these practices of trying to ascertain answers to pressing matters still comes through in prayers to our ancestors and various deities. Perhaps it is time our ruler begins doing public prayers and rituals so as to reassure the public at times."
 age_old_steppe_nomad_rivalries: "Age Old Rivals"
 age_old_steppe_nomad_rivalries_desc: "The people of the steppe that often times refuse to submit to our authority also refused to submit to Shang authority in the past; such rivalries between nomadic and settled people never seem to go away. The Shang, though, were not strong enough to venture our and defeat the nomads in the steppe and instead increased their defensive position when it was possible. Though some would find it strange for us to do this, it is a viable strategy and can stop the advance of not only nomadic neighbors, but also regular foot soldiers with siege equipment."
 compound_upon_shang_diplomacy: "Internal Diplomacy"
 compound_upon_shang_diplomacy_desc: "The internals of the Shang Dynasty were basic and not very strong as one might expect. Distant rulers who were still nominally beneath the head of the Shang Dynasty had a great amount of autonomy and often times the Shang king needed to make alliances with these people who were supposedly still inside the Shang domain. Though we have much better communication and stronger administration all around, we should learn to have a strong internal network of diplomacy going on so that we can know just what exactly is going on even in the furthest reaches of our empire."
 order_amongst_religious_life: "Ordered Religious Matters"
 order_amongst_religious_life_desc: "Just as how the Shang Dynasty of old had their religious matters calculated out via assigning various officials to tasks like divination and tomb preparation, we too shall have our religious matters squared away. If we allow the religious sector to go untouched for too long, corruption could easily creep in and start making us bleed from the inside out. Controlling clerical matters is just something that must be done so that the state can be even more fully realized to its greatest extent."
 the_focus_on_town_upkeep: "Garrisons Upon Garrisons"
 the_focus_on_town_upkeep_desc: "Taking our defensive mentality one step further with defensive artillery and even more layers of walls is exactly what we need! What our towns used to see as just stone walls and towers protecting them from outside dangers will become armorie and training facilities fit for making sure no enemy can hold a siege for long, lest they wish to encounter both a powerful Later Shang army and a hardened Later Shang sortie."

 cut_down_the_power_of_kings: "Divide up Internal Power"
 cut_down_the_power_of_kings_desc: "We have read about several pieces of the old Han Dynasty, but we of the later Han must look closely at the Rebellion of the Seven States and what was done after it. After this disastrous time, the Imperial Court enacted a series of reforms to better divide up the land of the Han Dynasty so that large chunks of territory could not so easily rebel. We of the Later Han must also look at doing the same since we could face similar issues if we allow large sections of the land to be ruled by singular authorities."
 discipline_of_frontier_life: "Frontier Discipline"
 discipline_of_frontier_life_desc: "The invasions of the Han Dynasty into the western reaches and taking over the old places like Shule and Loulan was remarkable to say the least. The Protectorate of Western Regions, as it was called back then, instilled a great deal of discipline in soldiers who were stationed there but it also gave rise to the possible danger of soldiers rebelling and splitting off. Still, a frontier region is valuable even to us as we know just how vital it can be to maintaining influence elsewhere and enhancing our own troop quality, even if it means the possibility of soldiers rising up later on."
 the_blurring_of_the_four_occupations: "The Changes we Can't Stop"
 the_blurring_of_the_four_occupations_desc: "The traditional view of the Four Occupations (gentry scholars, peasant farmers, artisans/craftsmen, and merchants/traders) has held sway in the culture of the Middle Kingdom for centuries without end, but as times change and we see the fruits of global trade connecting states like never before, the Four Occupations as a concept is unfolding and the classes of society are blending together somewhat. Instead of fighting this change, we should embrace it and actively work with the people in these new emerging social classes so that we can produce more internally."
 establishing_dutiful_subjects: "Dutiful Subjects"
 establishing_dutiful_subjects_desc: "It is not enough to simply project power internally amongst our various internal pieces of land. We must also strive to do as the Han Dynasty of old did and project our power outward either through conquest or diplomacy. Whatever route we take, we can rest assured that our envoys and diplomats are doing their work in keeping up with the politics of our subject states and collecting what tribute is necessary from them."
 the_issue_of_conufcianism_and_taoism: "Confucianism & Taoism"
 the_issue_of_conufcianism_and_taoism_desc: "Mending the teachings of Taoism, Confucianism, and Legalism is by no means an easy task, but scholars and administrators alike are capable of sifting through the dense words and thick passages to make a cohesive understanding of all three. Just like the Han Dynasty of before and how it mended these three together, so to will we for the great good of the people themselves. Harmony at every level of society!"

 the_most_capable_son_shall_rule: "The Most Capable Heir"
 the_most_capable_son_shall_rule_desc: "The Liao Dynasty of old had to contend with serious issues of their steppe traditions conflicting with traditions of the Middle Kingdom, one of these issues being how the Khitan people usually handled succession. We realize that how the Khitans of old did it, that is choosing the most capable son as the rightful heir, is much better than having the oldest born son being the heir since sometimes our oldest son is not viable for one reason or another. Merit over status! That is what we need!"
 khitan_legacy: "Khitan Legacy"
 khitan_legacy_desc: "The Khitan people had to inherently be accepting of other cultures, especially the culture of the Middle Kingdom since it was a very lucrative place to hold sway over. Despite adopting some traditions from the Middle Kingdom, the Liao Dynasty kept true to many of their own traditions and attempted to mesh the two groups together at times. Though their efforts more or less failed back then, we can strive to complete their efforts as we go into the future."
 experience_from_the_steppe: "Steppe Experience"
 experience_from_the_steppe_desc: "The blood of the Khitans was similar to the blood of other steppe people like the Mongols and the Jurchens: teeming with cavalry capability, particularly when it came to head-on cavalry strategies. Now that the Later Liao is reviving some of these old Khitan traditions, being skilled in cavalry warfare will be something we strive for so that we may carry on the legacy of old."
 parallel_administrative_bodies: "Two Administrations for Two Lands"
 parallel_administrative_bodies_desc: "What the Liao Dynasty of old attempted to do what put in place two parallel administrations: One for the lands of the Khitans and one for the lands of the cultures of the Middle Kingdom. It never was truly effective and it brought about more instability than prosperity, but we see it as a model that can be built off of. A sort of composite administration that seeks out to govern various geographic areas evenly and with locals in positions of power could serve us well in developing a more robust administration."
 rethinking_the_status_of_women: "Women of the Later Liao"
 rethinking_the_status_of_women_desc: "Unlike how the Middle Kingdom thinks of women in society, the Khitan people of old as well as us today think of women in a much different light. We value their contribution to society to a much greater degree and they have more autonomy in our society as compared with some stricter parts of the Middle Kingdom. In time we should work toward spreading this more equal idea for men and women throughout society, though understandably that will take many generations to do."

 the_example_of_shen_kuo_desc: "The great polymath (meaning knowledge spanning multiple subjects) Shen Kuo of the old Song Dynasty is an example for us all to look up to. He excelled in statecraft, was a mathematician, astronomer, botanist, diplomat, military general, economist, hydraulic engineer, and so many other things that even today he is still fondly remembered by many. Even his work in politics in the New Policies Group and in the Hanlin Academy is still recorded for us to look back upon, and it is with him as an example that our scholars and advisors will pursue the greatest truths in this corporeal world."
 new_wave_of_minor_major_reforms: "Overhaul and Reshape the Government"
 new_wave_of_minor_major_reforms_desc: "Politics and administration were the main component of the Song Dynasty of old and the various waves of political reforms shows us just how dedicated they were to keeping things cogent in the face of political rivalries and military threats. The Qingli Reforms (or 'Minor Reforms') that were implemented from 1043 to 1045 and the New Policies (or 'Major Reforms') that were implemented from 1069 to 1076 ensured two things: administrative competency throughout the entirety of the land, and more political rivalries. Despite what rivalries we might see today, we absolutely must work to utilize reforms like the Song Dynasty of old did."
 how_the_southern_song_survived: "The Second Phase of the Song"
 how_the_southern_song_survived_desc: "When the Liao Dynasty of the north were vanquished by the Jurchens of the Jin Dynasty, the Song Dynasty of old was pushed back south beyond the Huai River. Despite this setback, our ancestors still managed to thrive economically thanks to putting an emphasis on trade through docks and ports. We too must realize how vital these places are to our economy and bring them to more modern standards so that our trade sector can bolster the economy even more."
 pivotal_naval_strength_of_the_song: "Dominate the Coasts and Rivers"
 pivotal_naval_strength_of_the_song_desc: "Our ancestors utilized great water vessels in the rivers and on the coasts so that they could dominate trade and conflicts at various points. Though we don't need as much river control, we do need a great amount of sea control which means we will need to improve our heaviest warships with larger cannons and sturdier hulls."

 the_military_does_not_threaten_us_desc: "In order to make sure the the administration can keep functioning smoothly, we need to be sure that the military of all things does not rise up against us in any capacity. Whether this is through new officials being put into place or having harsher punishments on our military as a whole, we will find ways to make sure that our troops do not point their weapons on their masters."

 learn_from_the_sui_founding_desc: "The Sui Dynasty of old was founded as a sort of insurgency. Yang Jian (who would later become known as Emperor Wen of Sui) was originally to be the regent of the Northern Zhou court which was ruled by ethnically Xianbei people, but instead of continuing things as per usual, he usurped power and founded his own dynasty that helped push back against the Xianbei. We should be watchful and careful about who steps into our court and who is close to our royal family as we would rather not be subjected to the plans of another Yang Jian."
 costly_wars_against_the_cham: "Learn from the Cham Conflicts"
 costly_wars_against_the_cham_desc: "When our ancestral Sui Dynasty held power, they sought out not only land in the east, but also land in the south. These conflicts in the south were particularly brutal at times as the Cham and Viet people proved to be much stronger than previously imagined. We should learn from these incursions southward and equip our military with better provisions and materials when they are out on campaigns."
 buddhist_influences_entrenched: "Embrace Buddhist Influences"
 buddhist_influences_entrenched_desc: "The Northern and Southern Dynasties period saw a great influx of Buddhist teachings, people, and art as local Buddhist schools in the lands of the Middle Kingdom started to flourish. The Sui Dynasty of old helped bring life to this growing Buddhist movement inside the Middle Kingdom and we are heirs to this legacy. By coming to terms with the various schools of Buddhist thought embracing the Buddhist people in our lands without turning them away, we will be able to ease some tensions in our growing population."
 revive_the_army_that_invaded_east: "Revive the Fateful Army"
 revive_the_army_that_invaded_east_desc: "The Goguryeo-Sui Wars, the fated wars that helped end our ancestral dynasty, are full of lessons to be learned by our scholars and royal family. As we learn from them though, we must keep in mind that the power the Sui Dynasty held at that point effectively culminated in a grand army and navy that few had ever seen before. It is time we revive this grand army and field more troops than ever before, for we know that we can succeed where our ancestors failed."
 not_to_over_extend_our_economy: "Later Sui Economics"
 not_to_over_extend_our_economy_desc: "What helped lead to the downfall of our ancestors was the disregard and over exertion of the economy at the time in order to fund the unsuccessful wars against Goguryeo. If we are to ever become a cogent and stable state that can fund massive construction projects and decent military, we must first look to our economics and focus our efforts on proving that we can take care of our own finances."

 the_heat_of_northern_weis_founding_desc: "The Northern and Southern Dynasties period was chaotic for a great many people in the Middle Kingdom, but the Northern Wei brought a sense of stability to the north. The foundation they stood upon was carved by blades from all sides and as such it was made strong enough to withstand for several decades. Not only this, but it was strong enough to exert military potential outward during this tumultuous period, a trait we should strive to live up to."
 buddhism_of_the_northern_wei: "Buddhism of the Northern Wei"
 buddhism_of_the_northern_wei_desc: "During this period of when the Northern Wei rulers carved out a place for themselves in the world, Buddhism was spreading throughout the lands of the north. Northern Wei rulers converted to Buddhism and were great patrons of the various Buddhist sects, bringing together a great many people under their banner. It would be wise for us to patronize Buddhism just as our ancestral dynasty did so that we too can feel the benefit of having people flock to our banners."
 address_hostility_between_the_two_people: "The Hostility of our People"
 address_hostility_between_the_two_people_desc: "As many in the Middle Kingdom think and see, there are two distinct groups of people: the steppe nomads and the settled citizens; eternally hostile and eternally suspicious of each other. If we are to survive longer than our ancestral dynasty did, we need to work on mending these differences between settled people and nomadic people so that conflicts do not break out between our own internal provinces and groups of people."
 honor_the_warriors_of_our_land: "Respect for our Fighters"
 honor_the_warriors_of_our_land_desc: "If we do not respect and pay those who put their lives on the line to protect our state from harm, then we will collapse and be but another dynasty in books for the future. As time goes on we will ensure that soldiers serving us are paid regularly and honored with proper respect during and after their service so as to keep every part of our military running smoothly."
 the_developing_frontiers: "Our Frontiers"
 the_developing_frontiers_desc: "Though our frontiers are behind in development compared to our heartland, we still care for our frontiers via building outposts and small settlements throughout so that they are not completely left to the elements. We should utilize these frontiers to our advantage when we can by setting up our defenses in more strategic locations and building fortifications hard-to-reach places."

 tattered_history_of_our_name_desc: "There have been several instances of the name 'Zhao' being applied to states that rebelled and tried to make themselves something of a true dynasty for the whole of the Middle Kingdom, but each time the name Zhao surfaced to be seen, it was snuffed out by a larger foe. Now that we have chosen to take up the Zhao name and bring honor and respect back to it, we will work to instill righteous authority and proper laws throughout the land so that we do not fall so easily to external hostilities when they come knocking."
 adaptives_form_of_fighting: "The Discipline of Adaptation"
 adaptives_form_of_fighting_desc: "If there is one characteristic the old Zhao states had in common, it was trying to adapt to their surroundings so that they could survive the political and diplomatic climate around them. Though their efforts did not ultimately do much, we can still glean lessons from these failed attempts and discipline our own soldiers in adaptive forms of warfare like the various Zhao states of the past did. That way we can hold our own in future wars that come to the borders of the Middle Kingdom."
 realize_our_potential_han_zhao: "Realize our Potential"
 realize_our_potential_han_zhao_desc: "The rulers of Han Zhao (304 to 319 and 319 to 329) were astute and intelligent as many records indicate, but they were incompetent to the point of bringing their own state to ruin. There was potential in their state as many of our scholars now recognize, and just like them there is a great amount of potential in our own state, but we must learn from the mistakes of the Han Zhao and bring about a more cultivated administration that knows what moderation means, especially in times of war (since many rulers of Han Zhao were known to be cruel in times of war)."
 reform_the_court_later_zhao: "Formalize the Zhao Court"
 reform_the_court_later_zhao_desc: "The Later Zhao (319 to 351) that defeated the state of Han Zhao by capturing Liu Yao in 329 was filled with political intrigue and unstable court rivalries. This ultimately led to the downfall of the Later Zhao and its annexation which leads us to our own court today: What can we do to stabilize it? Focusing on working with rival court factions and utilizing multiple points of view on certain situations could alleviate some stress on the Zhao administration, we just need to be careful about how we go about this."
 eternal_peace_with_the_zhao: "Come to Lasting Peace"
 eternal_peace_with_the_zhao_desc: "Bringing about a new age to the entirety of the Middle Kingdom is no easy task, but we of the Zhao Dyansty have proven ourselves worthy of doing just that. We are focused on our people and providing what they need when they need it. Bolstering urban growth and ensuring that each of these large cities is defended to the best of our ability is crucial in maintaining prosperity and ensuring a bright future for us; soon enough, all of the Middle Kingdom will be at peace with the Zhao Dyansty."

 legacy_of_liu_yu: "The Legacy of Liu Yu"
 legacy_of_liu_yu_desc: "The man who started the Liu Song Dynasty of old, Liu Yu, can truly have been said to have carved out the dynasty for himself. His work as a general for the Jin Dynasty of old made sure that he had the martial talent when it was truly needed, and the fruits of his labor was that of a lasting military legacy that we today are dedicated to carrying on. Still, there is work for us to do before we can ever hope to achieve great victories like Liu Yu did."
 permanent_threats_to_our_power: "Permanent Threats"
 permanent_threats_to_our_power_desc: "Much like how the Liu Song of old had the permanent threat of the Northern Wei, we too have our own permanent threats. In order to address the threats we face, we must be ready with a military force that can outnumber anything our foes can muster whilst also supplying them with enough gunpowder, swords, spears, rations, and horses. In time we will be able to overwhelm and crush our foes so that we may know some semblance of lasting peace."
 remedy_military_shortcomings: "Do Not Lose Heart"
 remedy_military_shortcomings_desc: "Military failures were part of the reason why the Liu Song Dynasty of old fell into chaos since the Northern Wei were able to take advantage of the disunity of command going on amidst Liu Song ranks in various battles. If we can establish a solid chain of command and have clear communication networks when campaigns begin, our troops will never lose heart in battle and have confidence that the leaders of the military know exactly what they are doing."
 weeds_in_the_royal_dynasty: "Settle the Royal Feuds"
 weeds_in_the_royal_dynasty_desc: "Another reason why the Liu Song Dynasty of old crumbled was the constant atmosphere of political schemes and feuds between various prominent members. This led to assassinations of key figures and disunity across the entirety of the land, something we would do well to avoid by making sure any issues in the royal family are settled either by family members or in legal courts. We cannot risk breaking up due to internal feuds between various parts of the royal family."
 poets_and_scholars_of_chaos: "Thriving in Chaos"
 poets_and_scholars_of_chaos_desc: "Even though our ancestral dynasty never was in the best of shape, poets and scholars still thrived across the land. They created poetry, art, and studied the stars above whilst the fires of war and the daggers of intrigue swept across the land; who is to say that our own scholars and artisans can't thrive in tense times too? All it takes is ensuring them some safety and keeping internal revolts from happening."

 reinheitsgebot_for_our_beer_desc: "For far too long we have seen beer in German lands be made with a great deal of wrong and impure ingredients. While it is true that previous regulations regarding beer making have been passed at more local levels, in Austria-Bavaria there will be a much more strict enforcement of this legislation so that price competition with bakers for wheat and rye does not arise. The only ingredients allowed for beer made in our lands are as follows: water, barley, and hops."
 the_troublesome_south_and_east: "Troubles to the South and East"
 the_troublesome_south_and_east_desc: "Whilst Bavarian lands have been relatively safe inside of the Holy Roman Empire, Austrian lands have been plagued by issues with Hungarians, Turks, and Slavs of different sorts in the Balkans. These skirmishes and border conflicts to our south and east have given the military of Austria-Bavaria a fairly good understanding of how the field of battle works and it continually gives them motivation to keep the borders safe from further incursions."
 fugger_and_welsers_of_ab: "Fuggers and Welsers"
 fugger_and_welsers_of_ab_desc: "The illustriously wealthy mercantile families that are the Fuggers and Welsers know great fortune throughout Augsburg as well as other lands throughout the Holy Roman Empire, but none more so than perhaps Austria-Bavaria. If we can continue to harness their financial skills for our own affairs, Austria-Bavaria will always be ready for whatever financial mishaps come through in the future."
 navigating_hre_politics: "Navigating Holy Roman Politics"
 navigating_hre_politics_desc: "Moving through political schemes and diplomatic incidents throughout the Holy Roman Empire is not easy in the slightest, but the Austrian nobility and administration are adept at handling such matters. Bavarians may handle other duties better than Austrians, but when it comes to ensuring that diplomacy and politics are stowed away safely and without worry, Austrians are the ones to look toward."
 monpolizing_various_industries: "Monpolize German Industries"
 monpolizing_various_industries_desc: "Whether it is the copper industry, the salt industry, or even the paper-making industry, Austria-Bavaria is likely to have interests in it. German industries of various economic goods are thriving already, but we know that they could thrive even more if they were simply under better management and leadership. We shouldn't stress too much over this though, for in time we will obtain full hegemony over these economic factors and there will be less competition against us."
 discipline_of_the_grenzers: "Age of the Grenzers"
 discipline_of_the_grenzers_desc: "Keeping up with our borders is no easy task and though our military are motivated to keep it protected, new tactics and strategies that incorporate new military technology need to be developed. By shifting over to light infantry as opposed to continuing with heavy infantry will be key to Austria-Bavaria keeping up militarily, and these new Grenzers (otherwise known as 'frontiersman') will help us master new methods of doing battle."
 mastery_of_soft_power: "Master of Soft Power"
 mastery_of_soft_power_desc: "To project soft power outward and to use it to the benefit of the state is something that few in history have ever come to master. There are those few states and families that were able to thread the needles just right and get their family members and friendly courtiers into specific courts and halls to make a huge difference for one particular side. Austria-Bavaria will be exactly that kind of state, as its power not only comes from the words of its diplomats and royal family members, but also from its military that backs up every decree and action."
 attract_those_of_the_german_renaissance: "German Renaissance Attraction"
 attract_those_of_the_german_renaissance_desc: "The birth of great scholars and artists alike in the Italian Peninsula has led to a plethora of people from the Holy Roman Empire becoming inspired to bring these ideas northward over the decades. The German Renaissance, as some have called it, has thus brought great ideas and minds to Austria-Bavaria which is something that both Bavarian and Austrian courts benefit from greatly. Not only will our prestige last throughout the ages, but the ideas we espouse as well will last beyond our current generation."
 absolutist_power_means_a_standing_army: "To be Absolutist"
 absolutist_power_means_a_standing_army_desc: "The authority of the monarch is increasing as time goes on despite attempts to pull them back from this culmination of absolute authority. Though Austria-Bavaria has its own share of thoughts on Absolutism as a whole, we cannot deny that having a strong standing army is becoming a sign of a modernized and capable state. We must work on dismissing the system of feudal levies and work toward making our military something of a professional standard that can withstand foreign tactics and strategies."
 army_restructuring: "Prepared for the Next Age"
 army_restructuring_desc: "Just as Austria-Bavaria is becoming its own by slowly building up its power through diplomatic and military means, there are others out there who seek to best Austria-Bavaria in the heat of a large war for succcession or land. What then must be done? Perhaps the only thing that can be done is to restructure the military to handle these larger threats on our border whether they are French, Russian, Turkish, or some other state looking to pry off pieces of Austria-Bavaria."

 the_belgian_revolution: "Subjects No More"
 the_belgian_revolution_desc: "We have toiled under unjust authority for far too long, have we not? And what were the fruits of our labor despite the unjust burdens put upon us? Freedom and glory! Though it was hard to gain the status we currently hold and many may not like us currently, we can build up from where we are and build a solid state that listens to its people and represents them fairly."
 distinct_from_dutch_and_french: "Distinct, yet Familiar"
 distinct_from_dutch_and_french_desc: "Belgium is a mish-mash of two distinct though familiar cultures in the region the Low Countries. The Walloon people come from the lands of France whilst the Flemish people come from the Netherlands, though both have felt just how horrible things can be when the governing body if ineffective in every single way possible. Now is the time for both Flemish and Walloon to flourish into a truly charismatic and prestigous state that can stand out amongst European states as one that seeks both righteous governance and honest diplomacy."
 refusal_of_pure_despotism: "The Cracking of Monarchies"
 refusal_of_pure_despotism_desc: "Belgium's inception is something of bell ringing out all across Europe: the age of monarchs ruling with absolute power is not an age that will last forever. Some dynasties and leaders think the sun will shine on them until the end of time, but Belgium is almost living proof that the authority of despotism cannot go on forever without revolution from beneath later on. From this point on, Belgium must be a bastion of reform and compromise in its highest levels of office, even if we choose to have a monarch in power."
 shift_to_flemish_and_walloon_language: "Promote Flemish and Walloon"
 shift_to_flemish_and_walloon_language_desc: "French has been the traditional language of our court and official documents for a while now, but hanging on to the French identity through their language is only going to make Belgian politics more and more messy as time goes on. We should start shifting toward using Walloon and Flemish as the standard language of our courts so that we better represent our own people and we aren't leaning so hard on the traditions of others."
 continual_french_support: "Continual French Support"
 continual_french_support_desc: "Some of the French are eager to support us for one reason or another; perhaps it is to undermine the power of the Dutch or to gain influence further eastward. Whilst some in Belgium are suspicious of the French and their intentions, touting that they will want to annex Belgium altogether in the near future, we shouldn't be so quick to turn down French support after how far we have come. If we can build up our infrastructure and military based on French military principles, we'll be able to have an easier time fielding Belgian regiments in general."
 formulate_belgian_political_parties: "Solidify Belgian Politics"
 formulate_belgian_political_parties_desc: "The landscape of Belgium is diverse in some aspects, but also quite monotonous in other respects. Where it becomes especially interesting is in regards to political matters as the linguistic and cultural groups have drawn their rough lines all throughout Belgium already. Learning more about these groups on a person-to-person basis will allow for the formation of more stable and less violent political movements as we continue forth."
 evenly_distribute_the_burden: "The Even Burden"
 evenly_distribute_the_burden_desc: "And as we pass laws and edicts toward our diverse yet strong populous, we do so knowing that we are attempting act in their best interest at all times. Shady deals and corruption scandals may arise, but we will root out the traitors to Belgian politics as quickly as we can and maintain the great peace in our land that should always be present."
 as_thrifty_as_any_dutchmen: "Business is Business"
 as_thrifty_as_any_dutchmen_desc: "Though the Flemish may be seen by the Dutch in the Netherlands as 'lower' Dutchmen, the Flemish can do just as well with regards to trade negotiations and making a good profit. If our rivals want to compete against Belgian interests in markets around Europe and outside of Europe, then we will give them no quarter and ensure that all profits stream back to us whenever possible."
 satiate_german_and_french_minorities: "Minor Cultures of Belgium"
 satiate_german_and_french_minorities_desc: "Those who are distinctly French and German are easy to spot in Belgian land since they do not identify with Walloon or Flemish people and will make that fact known if counted in a census of any sort. These minorities should be rightfully accounted for and given some form of representation so that there is good communication between the minor groups of people in Belgium and the administration itself."
 high_level_diplomacy: "A Look in the Mirror"
 high_level_diplomacy_desc: "As we settle our internal affairs and seek out both alliances and trade treaties with states around us, we need to always be mindful of how we look to foreign powers. Is Belgium overstepping its limits? How does our military seem to foreigners near to us? These are just a couple questions our diplomats and officials should keep in mind when conducting diplomacy since it can help determine how we should be doing things inside our nation."
