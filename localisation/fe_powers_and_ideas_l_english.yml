 HKC_ideas_start: "Hokucho Traditions"
 HKC_ideas_bonus: "Hokucho Ambition"
 empowered_bakufu_of_japan: "Empower the Shogun"
 empowered_bakufu_of_japan_desc: "Japanese people only truly prosper under strict military guidance and authority. The shogun knows just how to help enforce this and will indeed do so with the emperor tucked away in a nice palace where people can think he is nothing more than a nice leading figure. The shogun's guidance must indeed lead to rightful conquest for the Japanese people."
 disempowered_emperor_of_japan: "Disempower the Emperor"
 disempowered_emperor_of_japan_desc: "With the emperor out of the way and having little actual legislative or military power throughout our land and all of Japan itself, there will be little in the way of us cultivating a strong military that strives for upholding the peace and prosperity of our land, the lands of the Northern Court."
 proper_vassal_ties: "Proper Subject Ties"
 proper_vassal_ties_desc: "The matter of how we deal with our subjects, both ones that pay regular tributes and ones that do not, is going to be something that comes up routinely in the politics of Hokucho. Let us tend to these matters with diligence and discipline so as to obtain the most out of our subject states, for that is the only way we will be able to ensure a strong and stable diplomatic sector."
 emphasis_on_military_skill: "Emphasis on Martial Prowess"
 emphasis_on_military_skill_desc: "The shogunate embodiers martial prowess emphasized over other matters, and though at times the administration itself is quite decentralized there is a staunch focus on military quality when ascending upwards in rank and title. As time goes on, our officers and commanders will be seasoned in military strategy and tactics so that the troops they command are led properly and without worry from the shogun."
 disciplined_samurai_class: "The Discipline of the Samurai"
 disciplined_samurai_class_desc: "Though at times the samurai of our Hokucho can be unruly, there is little doubt that they have great military potential. If we can tame them and integrate them into Hokucho ranks throughout the coming decades, there will be few that will be able to compete with our soldiers and the discipline they possess."
 solve_administrative_conflicts: "Conflicts of Interest"
 solve_administrative_conflicts_desc: "Inside the administration of the Northern Court, politics can often get messy between various advisors and officials, especially when it comes to various family ties and land grants. The shogun and those around him should ideally work toward a stable system of politics that can regularly appoint people to positions of prominence without worry of backlash from others since doing so will certainly create a good deal of legitimacy amongst the people."
 undo_rival_lord_power: "A Sword to Petty Rivals"
 undo_rival_lord_power_desc: "And within the lands of the Hokucho, shugo lords and certain daimyo who think they can oppose the will of the shogun will be handed their own head separated from their body. There will be no tolerance for unruly governors and such and we will ensure that loyal soldiers will cut down all who stand in the way of the progress of Hokucho."
 NNC_ideas: "Nancho Ideas"
 NNC_ideas_start: "Nancho Traditions"
 NNC_ideas_bonus: "Nancho Ambition"
 the_three_japanese_regalia: "The Three Sacred Treasures"
 the_three_japanese_regalia_desc: "Kusanagi no Tsurugi representing valor, Yata no Kagami representing wisdom, and Yasakani no Magatama representing benevolence; these are the three sacred treasure of Japan. Brought to our land by Ninigi-no-Mikoto, the legendary ancestor of the Imperial House of Japan, the Southern Court is the one that holds these grand relics. Those of the Northern Court or anyt other possible court in Japan are mere pretenders to the title of emperor and the power it wields and with these relics, we will make it known."
 restoration_of_true_imperial_power: "Restore True Imperial Power"
 restoration_of_true_imperial_power_desc: "With daimyo being scattered across Japan and a civilian administration not being present in the slightest, the people seeing the emperor in Nancho as both legitimate and taking the reins of command emboldens them in the face of adversity. No longer is it a military authority that is trying to lead the Japanese people, but rather it is the emperor himself and those loyal to him and the traditions of old. Let these traditions guide us into the future and strengthen the heart and soul of our military."
 reinstate_offices_of_civil_governors: "Reinstate Civil Governors"
 reinstate_offices_of_civil_governors_desc: "During the Nanboku-cho Jidai of 1336 to 1392, the office of 'civil governor' was gradually taken over by shugo lords all across Japan. They were in essence both governors with legitimate duties to uphold and feudal lords that vied for power amongst other feudal lords, causing both tension and decentralization throughout the land. If we can dismantle the system that brought the shugo lords to power and reinstate the offices of civil governors, we can ease the administrative burden on the Southern Court."
 disempower_the_shugo_lords: "Disempower the Shugo Lords"
 disempower_the_shugo_lords_desc: "Once we are done disempowering the shugo lords that once held a great deal of power over the lands of Japan, we can focus on bringing up the diplomatic posture of Japan to outside powers and people. Formalizing diplomatic relations and also ensuring that our land is free from foreign intrigue will go a long way in ensuring the prosperity of Nancho."
 endurace_of_the_southern_court: "Endurance of Nancho"
 endurace_of_the_southern_court_desc: "Though the Northern Court was slowed by a number of administrative difficulties during the Nanboku-cho Jidai, they still retained great military power and used it against the Southern Court, grinding it down into dust eventually. But, the Southern Court did not simply yield to these efforts from the north in one single battle, no, they endured for decades knowing that they were the rightful rulers of Japan. It is this enduring spirit that we must cultivate once more in our people."
 expand_and_reform_the_kanrei: "Expand and Reform the Kanrei
 expand_and_reform_the_kanrei_desc: "The kanrei has been a sort of deputy to the shogun and has served as one to help in administrative functions throughout the shogunate in the past; Ashikaga Yoshiakira (son of Ashikaga Takauji) had Hosokawa Yoriyuki as his kanrei and was successful in a a variety of political matters concerning shugo lords. If we can emulate this position of deputy for the emperor and expand the position with perhaps multiple deputies, there could be a great deal of legislation that becomes easier to discuss and push through."
 sole_legitimacy_over_japan: "The Only Keeper of Japan"
 sole_legitimacy_over_japan_desc: "The mon of Nancho will be what people gather to support the rightful emperor. Whether they be clans like the Kitabatake, the Tsutsui, the Date, or any others, they will know that there is one sole protector and leader of Japan and that is the emperor of the Nancho, the Southern Court. May the names of the Northern Court pretenders forever be tainted with illegitimacy."
 KNM_ideas: "Kenmu Ideas"
 KNM_ideas_start: "Kenmu Traditions"
 KNM_ideas_bonus: "Kenmu Ambition"
 spearhead_of_the_emperor: "The Emperor as our Leader"
 spearhead_of_the_emperor_desc: "The concept of the 'Kenmu Restoration' was spearheaded by Emperor Go-Daigo amidst the collapsing authority of the Kamakura Shogunate in the early 1330s. His ambition to retake authority away from the shogun and to bring back the power of the emperor is something to look up to as it is a shining example of what our lands could have been like without harsh military leadership."
 properly_deal_with_the_samurai_class: "To Deal with the Samurai Class"
 properly_deal_with_the_samurai_class_desc: "The class of unruly and powerful samurai in Japanese society has been a consistent factor in determining which daimyo thrives or dies, which shogun rises to power or dies mysteriously, and what laws get enforced on the local level in various provinces. We cannot let this continue and we must find a way to satisfy the samurai via proper military centralization and a thoroughly thought out army organization."
 land_owndership_questions: "How to Deal with Land Ownership"
 land_owndership_questions_desc: "Land ownership is also a tricky matter we must deal with if we are to be a true successor to the older Kenmu Restoration. Back then it was poorly handled thanks to Emperor Go-Daigo's various allies and supporters being people he didn't want to take land from, but we are stronger now administratively and can properly push through legislation that will refine the laws on land ownership without causing a breakdown in society."
 go_daigos_failure_with_civilians: "Emperor Go-Daigo's Civilian Failures"
 go_daigos_failure_with_civilians_desc: "A key failure in Emperor Go-Daigo's methods was not fulfilling his ambition to bring back the control of lands to civilians which angered quite a few people. If we can sort through the old laws on the books and build upon our earlier work that focused on land ownership, we can properly satisfy our people's need for land reform."
 the_military_class_do_not_rule: "Organize Classes in Society"
 the_military_class_do_not_rule_desc: "All too often we see the military class come forth to try to take control of the administration and away from the emperor. Indeed this is how the Ashikaga Shogunate came to power since its founder, Ashikaga Takauji, believed that the military class had the right to rule which flew in the face of Emperor Go-Daigo. We of Kenmu will not let this happen again and we will instead ensure that the military is kept under a tight and disciplined leash."
 go_daigos_corruption_failures: "Emperor Go-Daigo's Corruption"
 go_daigos_corruption_failures_desc: "Another facet of the Kenmu Restoration under Emperor Go-Daigo was the corruption and inexperience inherent within the tribunal system he set up. We should strive for a new tribunal and court system like Emperor Go-Daigo wanted, but place a much greater emphasis on education for the various positions needed and also work to make sure that corrupt ties do not seep into the system."
 put_the_governors_back_into_place: "Reinstate the Emperor's Authority"
 put_the_governors_back_into_place_desc: "The time for military governments is now over; the time for civilian governments is now. The emperor may not seem much different from the shogun, but in reality he rules with a comparatively lighter hold on the land and is not keen on a decentralized system of authority that places faith in military governors backed by unruly samurai. In time, the emperor's authority will become a welcome presence in all domains that the Japanese rule over."
 LML_ideas: "Lombard League Ideas"
 LML_ideas_start: "Lombard League Traditions"
 LML_ideas_bonus: "Lombard League Ambition"
 in_defense_of_the_peninsula: "In Defense of the Peninsula"
 in_defense_of_the_peninsula_desc: "The Italian Peninsula is rife with disruptions what with the Pope wanting power and various minor dukes and officials wanting power as well, but if there is one thing we are unified in, it is in defending the peninsula from foreign influence and aggression, especially when it comes the north. The Lombard League will stand tall and ready to defend the northern part of the peninsula once more!"
 papal_sanctioned_protection: "Sanctioned Defense"
 papal_sanctioned_protection_desc: "The Pope sanctioned our defense of the Italian Peninsula from the Holy Roman Empire's Frederick I and Frederick II, thus giving our military more justification and legitimacy when they took to the various walled cities to defend against invading armies of the Holy Roman Empire. The defense of the peninsula will of course be sanctioned once more should it be necessary, and even if the Pope cannot sanction us right at the time we need it, a cardinal or bishop will do just as well."
 cities_opposed_to_the_hre: "Opposition to the Holy Roman Empire"
 cities_opposed_to_the_hre_desc: "Those inside the Holy Roman Empire who stand against expanding influence of the emperor are mostly of Italian descent since our identity and culture is far different from places such as Bavaria, Saxony, and Verden. Though it will be tough to properly coordinate politics and military affairs amongst the various Italian cities of the north, we can be sure that if we succeed in coordinating a unified strategy for our combined military forces, there will be none who can break the Lombard League."
 beyond_driot_de_regale: "Beyond the Driot de Regale"
 beyond_driot_de_regale_desc: "The Peace of Constance in 1183 established a compromise between Italian cities and the emperor of Holy Roman Empire wherein, the cities would retain a level of autonomy (driot de regale) in exchange for loyalty to the emperor. This agreement is long forgotten by many people in the heart of the Holy Roman Empire, but Italian cities remember it dearly. There will be more than just autonomy for the Italian cities, there will be independence with Italians governing themselves!"
 turn_over_any_imperial_ban: "An Imperial Ban is Nothing"
 turn_over_any_imperial_ban_desc: "When Emperor Frederick II tried to gain more power in the peninsula, he issued an Imperial Ban on the Lombard League wand waged war against it back then. This is seen by us as a badge of honor instead of a mark of shame as we fought back bravely against the armies of the Holy Roman Empire and won at the Siege of Parma in 1248! Let others who oppose the central power of the Holy Roman Empire join our effort to dismantle it!"
 reform_the_universitas: "Reform the Universitas"
 reform_the_universitas_desc: "The 'universitas' of the old Lombard League was a council that consisted of representatives appointed by individual municipalities; it voted via a majority on various matters like new members being admitted and whether to wage continued war or strive for peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Reforming this representative part of our government will help keep the spirit of republican ideals alive and well."
 customs_union_and_trade_privleges: "Refine the Customs Union"
 customs_union_and_trade_privleges_desc: "Whilst the Lombard League has traditionally been a decentralized confederation of sorts overall, the past iterations of it saw the creation of a customs union that handled matters of trade much more effectively than smaller trade guilds used to. If we can build upon that foundation of a customs union and refine it as time goes on with better business practices, the Lombard League may indeed be more profitable when united like this."
 SMA_ideas: "Somali Ideas"
 SMA_ideas_start: "Somali Traditions"
 SMA_ideas_bonus: "Somali Ambition"
 united_somali_communites: "United Somali Communities"
 united_somali_communites_desc: "The various Somali communities and towns that are spread across the Horn of Africa have been fractured in the past, swearing loyalty to different leaders so that one day they would see unification. It was a turbulent path to unity but out of the fires of war and through firm diplomacy, Somali people can finally say with confidence that they are united behind one flag and one state, ready to defend it no matter the cost."
 dominant_merchant_fleets: "Fleets of Somalia"
 dominant_merchant_fleets_desc: "Somali people have made their living off of trade for centuries thanks to the great coastal cities that provide safe places for merchant vessels. Guarding these waters against attacking raiders and such is also part of what earns Somali people prosperity and a good reputation, and it is because of this protective attitude toward our coasts and trade routes that we have amassed such a magnificent fleet."
 hegemony_over_ports: "Harbors of Somali Strength"
 hegemony_over_ports_desc: "Improving and building up our habors and docks is a natural part of promoting trade growth. From setting up new docking areas to building new structures for merchants to do business in, each one of our coastal cities and harbors is key in attracting merchants from everywhere we can think of."
 formal_clan_duties: "Formal Clan Duties"
 formal_clan_duties_desc: "The various clans of Somalia are diverse in their origins and they pose a possible threat to our power if they become dissatisfied with our authority. By structuring the government of Somalia in such a way that it gives each formal clan a workable position in Somalia, we can lessen the threat they pose and increase the amount of resources they give to us, the most important one being men capable of fighting."
 somali_honor_guards: "Somali Honor Guards"
 somali_honor_guards_desc: "We have been the victims of our own ambition, in a sense. We desire wealth and prosperity through trade, thus we lacked the ambition to formulate a proper military on land that could at least defend Somali communities effectively. It is now that we will turn this around and begin instituting strong reforms to the Somali soldiers aimed at instilling discipline in them. It will take a long time to achieve our goals for our military, but laying a solid foundation here and now will go a long way in Somalia's future."
 command_east_africa: "Command of East Africa"
 command_east_africa_desc: "Our ambitions in East Africa are known all across our administration and as we continue to project our power over the great cities of wealth that line the coast of East Africa, we will only see our revenue rise higher and higher. Few can contest the amount of wealth made in cities such as Zanzibar and Mombasa as it is, now imagine how much more wealth they would bring in if we controlled them."
 somali_ocean: "The Somali Ocean"
 somali_ocean_desc: "The vast ocean to our east, it is rife with opportunity if we can claim it for ourselves, but we will not be the only ones sending ships out there to claim trade routes and mercantile chances. Our ships and sailors need to be ever present and ever vigilant of what threats there are to our extensive trading in the ocean, and when intruders try to break into the Somali Ocean despite our hegemony, we will gladly send them to the dark depths of the ocean."
 FJI_ideas: "Fujiwara Ideas"
 FJI_ideas_start: "fujiwara Traditions"
 FJI_ideas_bonus: "Fujiwara Ambition"
 foremost_clan_closest_to_power: "Fujiwara Soft Dominance"
 foremost_clan_closest_to_power_desc: "From about the 900s to about the 1100s, the Fujiwara Clan was at its peak with soft power being extended all around Japanese land thanks to familial connections to the emperor. It is time that the Fujiwara Clan is known once more in every part of Japan instead of these petty clans that split off from our old rivals so long ago. Our sons and daughters will find good company in various families of prominence and we will find ourselves with an immense amount of power in time."
 the_sessho_and_kampaku_positions: "Positions as Sessho and Kampaku"
 the_sessho_and_kampaku_positions_desc: "Sessho is a title traditionally given to the regent of a child emperor; kampaku is traditionally something of a chief advisor, first secretary, and regent who assists the adult emperor. It was during the Heian Period some centuries ago that the Fujiwara Clan held these two positions with relative ease and without worry (a cadet branch named Hokke was able to establish a hereditary claim to the position of regent as a whole). It is time that these two positions come back to being firmly under the Fujiwara Clan as a whole."
 strong_links_via_soft_power: "Utilize Familial Connections"
 strong_links_via_soft_power_desc: "Perhaps our most prominent familial ancestor was Fujiwara no Michinaga (966-1027). Grandfather of three emperors, father of six empresses, and the grandfather of seven other imperial consorts, it is by no means an exaggeration to say that he symbolized the apex of Fujiwara power and influence. We will strive to do similarly to Fujiwara no Michinaga and establish dynastic ties and links with foreign families to ensure that our soft power spreads even further, possibly beyond the lands of Japan itself."
 uphold_strict_family_governance: "Strict Family Governance"
 uphold_strict_family_governance_desc: "During the height of the Fujiwara Clan's power, several lesser members were court nobles, provincial governors, members of the provincial aristocracy, and even some were known as samurai. By emphasizing strict family governance and promoting better education efforts for the Fujiwara Clan as a whole, we can ensure a much stronger administration that can keep our lands stable no matter what happens."
 to_become_the_puppet_master: "Becoming the Puppet Master"
 to_become_the_puppet_master_desc: "Slowly but surely, Fujiwara influence is seeping into every part of Japanese society. Those clans that might still hold out against our resurgence will not hold out for much longer as our network of nobles and warriors will surely catch them out sooner or later. When all is said and done, there will be only the Fujiwara Clan left to be the military and administrative puppet master of the entirety of Japan."
 a_new_period_of_cultural_flourishing: "Renewed Cultural Flourishing"
 a_new_period_of_cultural_flourishing_desc: "Whilst our administration is handling the likes of provincial matters and passing laws to ensure that our power is felt all across the land, many members of the Fujiwara Clan are seeking a renewed period of cultural insight through the likes of poetry and plays. Though this path may seem useless and not worth the effort to various samurai leaders, we recognize that we have the power to establish a new golden age of Japanese culture if we simply empower our people to strive for it."
 steady_enforcement_of_fujiwara_power: "All under the Fujiwara Clan"
 steady_enforcement_of_fujiwara_power_desc: "Though our influence declined beyond the 1100s due to the Taira Clan and the Minamoto Clan fighting for power in Heian-kyo, they remained dominant in terms of being close advisors the emperors. Now that there is one grand clan that is uniting all of Japan under its authority, few will be able to oppose the soft power we project through our family members and also the hard power we have in the form of a strong military sector."
 TAA_ideas: "Taira Ideas"
 TAA_ideas_start: "Taira Traditions"
 TAA_ideas_bonus: "Taira Ambition"
 the_kanmu_heishi_lineage: "The Kanmu Heishi Lineage"
 the_kanmu_heishi_lineage_desc: "Some grandchildren of Emperor Kanmu (736-806) were the first to actually take on the name 'Taira' after 825. Though other descendants of Emperor Nimmyo, Montoku, and Koko took on the name 'Taira', it was the ones descended from Emperor Kanmu that became the most prominent in Japan. Those of the Kanmu Heishi lineage, founded in 889 by Taira no Takamochi, became some of the most influential people during the Heian Period. Though times have changed since the days of the Heian Period, the Kanmu Heishi lines of descent are still very much around and we will utilize them as much as we can."
 taira_no_kiyomori_samurai_lineage: "Taira no Kiyomori's Samurai"
 taira_no_kiyomori_samurai_lineage_desc: "Learning from what Taira no Kiyomori did with those under his command will help us better organize the Taira military sector since Taira no Kiyomori organized one of the first samurai government structures in all of Japan. If we can compound on this and refine the structure as time goes on, officers and commanders of our military will be in a much better position whenever war comes to our clan."
 the_hogen_and_heiji_rebellions: "The Hogen and Heiji Disturbances"
 the_hogen_and_heiji_rebellions_desc: "The Hogen and Heiji Disturbances were relatively short civil wars that resulted in a variety of politics shifting in Japan for the time, but the most prominent shift was the Fujiwara Clan falling from power and us, the Taira Clan, becoming stronger than ever before. We remember this time fondly and live for the day when we can restore our power to this point, but we must contend with the fact that it may be a while before we hold most of Japan under our authority."
 rein_in_the_kanmu_heishi_lines: "Rein in the Branching Clans"
 rein_in_the_kanmu_heishi_lines_desc: "The various clans that branched off of the Kanmu Heishi lineage became various local governors and daimyo as time went on. Those of the Chiba, Miura, and original Hatakeyama Clan are just some of the most prominent branches of the lineage and they will need to be reined sooner rather than later so that the Taira Clan itself has no true opposition to its power. If we cannot rein them in via diplomatic means, then we will fight them in the field of battle."
 learn_from_loss_in_the_genpei: "Losses in the Genpei War"
 learn_from_loss_in_the_genpei_desc: "The Genpei War was more or less the end of Taira power since Minamoto no Yoritomo's rebellion culminated in the Kamakura Shogunate. If we are to restore our old power and retain it through the fires and rebellion, then we must build up our military tactics and strategy to the point that we can counter any internal threats we may face."
 defeat_minamoto_power: "Defeat the Minamoto Descendants"
 defeat_minamoto_power_desc: "Though the Kamakura Shogunate ended after the Kenmu Restoration, the various branching dynasties of the Minamoto Clan are still a viable threat to the power of the Taira Clan. Building up a large enough military to combat them will be key since in this age of ever evolving diplomacy and military technology, they could bring to light things we have not yet faced. No matter what it takes, we must crush any lingering source of Minamoto power."
 restoration_of_proper_power: "Revived and Refined"
 restoration_of_proper_power_desc: "With our resurgence close to being fully realized and few others standing in our way, there are few who can doubt the legitimacy of our administration and its leadership. The Fujiwara Clan is out of politics for good, Minamoto Clan is thoroughly swept out of any scene we care for, and the Tachibana Clan has been gone for centuries now. Let us usher in a new age of grandeur for the Japanese people, and let the Taira Clan bring a new age of prosperity upon a united Japan."

 the_21_genji_lines: "The 21 Genji Branches"
 the_21_genji_lines_desc: "The various branchs of the Minamoto Clan are descended from various emperors from the past. Though some branches are no longer around, many still are and hold a considerable amount of power around Japan, power that we will need to take for ourselves if we wish to succeed in the future. Once all the branches are reined in, we will have an a vast amount of manpower to draw from for future conflicts."
 guardians_of_heian_kyo: "Guarding Heian-kyo"
 guardians_of_heian_kyo_desc: "When the Fujiwara Clan was in power, they often called upon Minamoto Clan members to restore order in Heian-kyo when things broke down into violent clashes. This legacy of guarding the imperial capital is what instills discipline into the heart of many Minamoto soldiers and leaders and we will continue the tradition long into the future. The greatest of our soldiers will know honor and grandeur in the imperial capital, but they will never drop in their disciplinary missions or measures."
 destruction_of_the_taira_clan: "Destruction of the Taira Clan"
 destruction_of_the_taira_clan_desc: "The rule of the Taira Clan was brief by some accounts, but it was a long and arduous period for the Minamoto Clan. It was only by Minamoto no Yoritomo's efforts in starting the Genpei War that we came to ultimate power, founding the Kamakura Shogunate shortly after and bringing a great amount of prestige and honor to our clan. Let this destruction of the Taira Clan be a memory that all in the Minamoto Clan cherish, for it was the time when we saw our grand rise to power."
 legacy_of_the_first_bakufu: "Legacy of the Kamakura Shogunate"
 legacy_of_the_first_bakufu_desc: "The Kamakura Shogunate was where we held immense amounts of power throughout Japan, but it was not complete as there were those who tried to oppose our authority and decentralize the administration. If we can reinstate our authority with a new shogunate and cultivate a much stronger central administration, there will be none who can escape our grasp and enforce their own local edicts."
 restoration_of_minamoto_power: "Restore Minamoto Power"
 restoration_of_minamoto_power_desc: "To properly restore Minamoto power, land will need to be annexed, local lords will need to be culled, and strict adherence to our laws must the norm. The largest hurdle for us will be the annexation of land though, since there are many in Japan and even outside of Japan who would oppose the grand unification that we dream of."
 revoke_the_power_of_shikken: "Revoke the Power of the Shikken"
 revoke_the_power_of_shikken_desc: "During the time of the Kamakura Shogunate, the shikken was a titular post traditionally held by a member of the Hojo Clan. They were supposed to be a regent for us until the young leader-to-be was ready to take hold of command, but throughout political moves and various ties to family members, the Hojo Clan was able to maintain ultimate authority in the administration whilst the shogun was reduced in power. We will learn from this and ensure that no shikken is ever able to use the Minamoto Clan in such a way like a puppet master would."
 the_one_true_leader_of_japan: "Ascend Feudal Politics"
 the_one_true_leader_of_japan_desc: "From the grounds of feudal politics, the Minamoto Clan has found both great power and solid foundation for its rise to power. Through the discipline of our military and through the military-oriented administration of the shogunate, we will cultivate a new future for our people that is brighter than ever before! The Minamoto Clan will know no boundaries and its blades will cut through any enemy that stands in the way!"

 lvn_symbol_of_italian_unification_desc: "Shattered into feuding duchies and republics that want power, wealth, and prestige, the lands of the Italian Peninsula are rife with warfare and tension that others have exploited for centuries. With the unification of Lombards and Venetians though, there is something that can finally begin to fully unite the people of Italy together into one cohesive state that is governed by Italians, for Italians. Let those pesky French, Spanish, and German monarchs be cast away as we make our grand rise to power!"
 lvn_land_and_sea_arsenal: "Lombard Armories; Venetian Arsenals"
 lvn_land_and_sea_arsenal_desc: "Whether by sea or by land, we will always be ready for battle. Foundations in Milan and Venice mean that we are capable of fielding proper troops and ships in an organized fashion that is comparable to the likes of other large states; the only thing limiting us in this regard is how much we can really afford. Disciplined troops and strudy ships are not cheap, but we know for a fact that Lombardy-Venetia can produce both without failure."
 lvn_honest_representation_of_italians: "Represent the Italian People"
 lvn_honest_representation_of_italians_desc: "Monarchy? Republic? Both are options for Lombardy-Venetia, but what is not an optional is representing the various Italian people in our domain. They have suffered for too long at the hands of outside influences trying to extract wealth and prestige from them whilst being too weak to ever truly fight back. We will turn this around and give proper representation in the government to Lombards, Venetians, Ligurians, Neapolitans, Umbrians, and all others who can truly call themselves, 'Italian'."
 mlo_epitome_of_the_renaissance: "The Peak of the Renaissance"
 mlo_epitome_of_the_renaissance_desc: "Though we can't really define when the Renaissance started and ended, we can define the period of heightened cultural and scholarly output of the Italian Peninsula! Milan, Mantua, Venice, and several other cities thrived during this time and we will continue this emphasis on being where thinkers, musicians, poets, and artists flock to so that their work is spread far and wide."
 mlo_a_permanent_military_force: "From Mercenary Times Onwards"
 mlo_a_permanent_military_force_desc: "Condottieri have come and gone in the Italian Peninsula, but their legacy lives on in our military today. Several officers and commanders in Lombardy-Venetia are descendants of previous condottieri which means we do have a bit of mercenary blood in our ranks, but in order to prevail in the future, we will need to build a standing army. Slowly but surely, we will enacy steady reforms aimed at lessening our reliance on mercenary contracts and increasing our actual military potential."
 mlo_enlightened_rulership: "Enlightened Principles"
 mlo_enlightened_rulership_desc: "It is not enough to be held to the standards of French, Spanish, or German traditions of how leaders should rule; they rule with iron fists and edicts stemming from the heavens through the clergy, but we see the need for more concrete and rational principles in governance. We must rule for the benefit of not only wealthy merchants and nobles, but also for the good of our own people, and we also need to work on creating solidarity and trust between our commoners and our bureaucrats."

 mlo_rally_lombards_and_venetians_desc: "When the time comes for war against German soldiers, French cavalry, or Spanish ships, people will rally to the cause of Lombardy-Venetia. The noble flame carried forth by our grand union between Lombards and Venetians will not be put so easily by pompous kings and emperors from afar. The people of the Italian Peninsula know what they fight for is right and just, and the fight will burn into the dead of night should it need to."
 ven_influences_beyond_adriatic: "The Reach of the Venetians"
 ven_influences_beyond_adriatic_desc: "If it was not for the Republic of Venice and its great reach beyond the shores of the Italian Peninsula, would there be any power that thought of the Italians as viable threats? Most likely not! And it is because of this great reach that the Venetians cultivated that we are so connected throughout the Mediterranean Sea and beyond. In time, we are going to make more friends and allies who can aid Lombardy-Venetia in its endeavors and perhaps we can strike a trade deal or two with them."
 ven_trade_monopolies: "Mediterranean Trade Monopolies"
 ven_trade_monopolies_desc: "Securing trade monopolies is not an easy thing to do, but if anyone can do it, it is the people of Lombardy-Venetia. The mercantile skills of the Venetians combined with the martial prowess of the Lombards can easily net us a strong position if we need to make a violent entrance into a market, but even if we don't, the expertise of our merchants will slowly increase our trade power in all markets around Lombardy-Venetia."
 ven_naval_bases: "Expand our Arsenals"
 ven_naval_bases_desc: "To help keep our many trade routes safe, it would be wise for us to build up more arsenals and naval bases at our coastal holdings around the Adriatic and Mediterranean Sea. It will cut down on maintenance and also bolster our naval strength compared to the likes of other rival powers around us."
 ven_protect_what_is_ours: "Protected Assets"
 ven_protect_what_is_ours_desc: "Fending off rival merchants is a bit of risky task as it could easily lead to trade wars if state officials get involved from both sides. Still though, we are dedicated to ensuring that trade flowing into and out of Lombardy-Venetia is safe and secure so that our profit margins are where we want them to be; if we have to fight to secure our profits from foreign smugglers or raiders, then we will absolutely do so!"

 hxa_unite_the_scattered_cities: "Unite the Scattered Cities"
 hxa_unite_the_scattered_cities_desc: "The coasts of our land have scattered cities and villages, just as the mountains and hills do if one travels further inland. For far too long they've been without unity and without central guidance, but that is no more. We will build up these villages into towns, and we will build up infrastructure inside these towns and cities so that they can provide more manpower, taxes, and also produce more crops for our empire."
 hxa_central_religious_unity: "Destroy the Foreign Faiths"
 hxa_central_religious_unity_desc: "Foreigners might think of us having strange traditions that must be taken down, but we are much stronger than before. Our religious officials and devoted people have done much in the way of reforming religious rituals and traditions to the point where we can effectively enforce a unified state religion throughout the land. We will do as such through edicts and laws, and we will eradicate these foreign faiths that seek to erase what traditions have been passed down to us."
 hxa_workings_of_gold_and_jade: "Goldsmiths and Jade Artisans"
 hxa_workings_of_gold_and_jade_desc: "The lands of our people are rife with gold, jade, and other precious materials that many value for their quality and rarity. Because we have so much time to refine how we work these materials in terms of sculptures and artwork, many works we produce are traded across the world for high prices and some merchants even come back to our shores seeking more. It is this kind of mercantile and artisnal work that helps keep Huaxyacac in a position of prominence beyond its own shores."
 hxa_codices_of_our_history: "The Works of our History"
 hxa_codices_of_our_history_desc: "We have tried for centuries to keep track of our past with codices and writing, but our scattered languages and unrefined writing systems have produced more difficulties than possibilities for us. If we concentrate on working out a common writing system and a foramlized set of language for Huaxyacac as a whole, then we can track our history through works of writing and art with great precision and it will also help track the lineage of the royal family."
 zap_religious_heart_of_mitla: "Mitla, the Religious Heart"
 zap_religious_heart_of_mitla_desc: "The Zapotec people have had their high priest, the Uija-tao, stationed at Mitla. A place where Mixtec architectural styles mix with Zapotec styles in a beautiful display that is also the gateway between the world of the living and the world of the dead, Mitla is a place uniquely suited to be where our religious power comes from in our capital region. Priests and devoted followers of our faith will surely make regular trips to Mitla and we will recruit faithful followers there without question."
 zap_empire_building_once_again: "To Build Another Empire"
 zap_empire_building_once_again_desc: "Who is friend, and who is foe? The days of the Tlapanec, Mixtec, and most all the Zapotec people stretch back for centuries and in those old days, the Zapotec people cultivated perhaps the largest empire out of the three groups of people. Though it did not stretch far, it was very impactful on the people and they still strive for those days of being a truly dominant power in the region. If we are to build another empire, we must ensure we can have strong allies and small rivals whilst building up our internal domain through governors and advisors."
 zap_beyond_obsidian: "Fashioning New Weapons"
 zap_beyond_obsidian_desc: "The weaponry of our ancestors are no longer capable of winning battles and wars, for the days of obsidian arrows and spears are long gone. Now we must take to gunpowder weapons both large and small, building up a military that can effectively use them in battle against whatever enemy they encounter. We will prioritize our infantry in this matter since our homeland is not suited for masses of cannons or cavalry moving through the thick jungles and steep hills."
 mix_connect_the_city_states: "Roads through Huaxyacac"
 mix_connect_the_city_states_desc: "As we build up the infrastructure of our towns and cities, we will of course need proper roads to go between them all so that communication is much easier for both civilians and military officials. Simple dirt paths won't be enough through the jungles and hills of our region, no, Huaxyacac needs strong roads made of stone so that walking, running, or marching on said road is not a hazard in any sense."
 mix_learn_from_previous_battles: "Cultivating Endurance"
 mix_learn_from_previous_battles_desc: "Centuries of warfare in the jungles and hills of the region have hardened the Mixtec, Tlapanec, and Zapotec people. They know exactly what war brings to the land and to their own communities and they know exactly what precautions must be taken when the horns of war sound off. The struggles now may bring many to the point of death or close to it, but sacrifice right now will lead to success after the war is won."
 mix_refine_tribute_systems: "Taxation & Tribute"
 mix_refine_tribute_systems_desc: "The way taxes and tribute have been conducted and sent throughout the region in centuries past has led to tenuous holds on power since it was unorganized and fairly open to corruption. Now that we of Huaxyacac are fairly keen on centralizing things and reforming our economic potential, ensuring that our system of collecting taxes and tribute is able to function properly is what we need to focus on."
 tla_reformation_of_cotton_armor: "Beyond Cotton Armor"
 tla_reformation_of_cotton_armor_desc: "Cotton armor has been a consistent piece of armor throughout our region as it is light, flexible, easy to gain the ingredients, and can stop a variety of light attacks. Things are changing fast though and cotton armor is no longer capable of standing up to newer weapons. We need to employ new armor with new materials so that our troops can keep themselves safe in the heat of battle, or can at least survive a blow or two from being up close and personal."
 tla_endless_wars: "Endless War"
 tla_endless_wars_desc: "The fact that the Tlapanec, Zapotec, and Mixtec people have faced centuries of warfare not only internally, but also externally too means that the people are no stranger to what it is like to be called up for military service. Our training standards need to be more formalized and with better equipment so that any and all soldiers we enlist are ready when for battle at a quicker rate."
 tla_strong_internal_domain: "Strengthen our Foundations"
 tla_strong_internal_domain_desc: "The foundations of Huaxyacac can seem weak to outsiders and indeed to some officials they are still weak as of today. Reforming the way laws are passed and how local officials handle the enforcement of laws can give us a much stronger foundation since it will allow for us to have confidence that our local communities are providing what they can for the empire as a whole."
