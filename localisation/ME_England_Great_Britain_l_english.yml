 # Events:
 ME_England_Events.1.t: "Maine Reclaimed"
 ME_England_Events.1.d: "Ever since the French have captured the city, the English Loyalists have stayed in hiding to avoid persecution by the French. However, on this blessed day, the aforementioned men are able to go out of hiding and finally be free to express their loyalty to us. The mentioned men formed a mob that is currently welcoming our forces into the city of Maine. Lots of the men want to commit to the war effort and boost our dwindling manpower reserves."
 ME_England_Events.1.a: "Forward, to glory!"

 ME_England_Events.2.t: "The Second Treaty of Tours"
 ME_England_Events.2.d: "At last, we are victorious. The war that lasted a hundred years is finally over. Alas, many have lost their lives, both civilians and soldiers. Villages were burned, cities were sacked, lands of France - devastated. But now, the war is finally over. Order has been restored to the French Lands, a new order. The French Kingdom lies at our mercy. It is time for the second Treaty of Tours."
 ME_England_Events.2.a: "We must focus on the continental affairs."
 ME_England_Events.2.b: "This kingdom will make a fine addition to my collection."

 ME_England_Events.3.t: "Jack Cade's Rebellion"
 ME_England_Events.3.d: "Angered by the events of the Hundred Years' War and the taxes that came with it, peasants have risen up in a rebellion against the government as we could not cope with their demands. The rebels claim that the current regime is corrupt and the king's court is abusing its powers. Inspired by previous rebellions, the peasantry of Sussex and Kent have risen up in a revolt against the government and are now on the march to seize London."
 ME_England_Events.3.a: "Damn Them!"
 ME_England_Events.3.b: "His rebellion is quite interesting..."

 ME_England_Events.4.t: "Book of Common Prayer"
 ME_England_Events.4.d: "To aid in clerical influence over the commonfolk, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his council of advisors have come up with the novel idea to introduce a special compendium of ceremonies and prayer that would help to induce religious unity across the nation's innumerable churches. In all English lands, the 'Book of Common Prayer' is to be as the standard of faith and ceremony, effectively pairing with the dissolution of monasteries to assert religious unity and control over the people. One question remains as to the nature of this introduction: to what degree shall we rush to spread this compendium?"
 ME_England_Events.4.a: "Gradual introduction will serve us best"
 ME_England_Events.4.b: "The faster, the better!"

 ME_England_Events.5.t: "Pilgrimage of Grace"
 ME_England_Events.5.d: "With the consolidation of religious matters in the hands of the state, the nation has entered a hopefully temporary state of turmoil akin to chaos. With the dissolution of monasteries and other religious developments, our state finds itself met with pure iconoclastic rage, enough to inspire fear in the brave man's soul. The trumpets of rebellion sing their jaunty tune; the people of the north call for revolt. Their Pilgrimage is upon us."
 ME_England_Events.5.a: "Fools!"

 ME_England_Events.7.t: "Statutes of Iona"
 ME_England_Events.7.d: "With the establishment of state-funded schools in the Lowlands and our glorious conquest of the northern clans, we are now left with unruly clans that still resist our laws and try to govern themselves. The so-designated 'Statutes of Iona' are to end this cultural war and to bring the Highlander cultures closer to the much more English-like Lowlander Scottish."
 ME_England_Events.7.a: "Adopt the Statutes"
 ME_England_Events.7.b: "The clans should be left alone"

 ME_England_Events.8.t: "Policies of Iona Pay Off"

 ME_England_Events.9.t: "Work of William Caxton"
 ME_England_Events.9.d: "In our land of opportunity, another man succeeds. A Kentish man, William Caxton, aged 54, has established a printing press in Westminster. Year previously, he translated and printed the 'Recuyell of the Histories of Troye'. He even started working on a Encyclopaedia, which is soon due to finish."
 ME_England_Events.9.a: "Splendid!"

 ME_England_Events.10.t: "The Icy Grip of Death"
 ME_England_Events.10.d: "The once merry tune of church bells seems to fade unto the grey morning mist. At a time a source of joy, they call forth the open casket of our dear [Root.Monarch.GetName], pride and joy to all who served beneath him. As the bells slow, an eerie tune begins to sound throughout [Root.Capital.GetName]. Our former [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s body moves slowly through the city, without motion and without an heir to bequeath the throne. The [Root.GovernmentName] lay in ruin, and the succession remains untaken. There is but one person to seize our throne now. King of the Scots, [SCO.Monarch.GetName] was a distant to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and thus is the only seemingly legitimate heir to our lands."
 ME_England_Events.10.a: "Our relative in Scotland shall proceed to rule [Root.GetName]"
 ME_England_Events.10.b: "Let us appoint a local noble instead."

 ME_England_Events.11.t: "An Unresolved Conflict"
 ME_England_Events.11.d: "In spite of the countless wars and ceasefires, the conflict between the French and English Kingdoms stands unresolved. Throughout the years the [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty] claim to the French throne is growing weaker and weaker. It is time to strike the French Kingdom before our claim to their throne becomes nothing but a mere laughingstock for other european monarchs."
 ME_England_Events.11.a: "We will prevail!"

 ME_England_Events.12.t: "Confirmation of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Coronation"
