 FLA_calais_title: "Seize Calais"
 FLA_calais_desc: "Calais and its surroundings have always been considered a part of Flanders. It is a real shame then that the vile English kings have had the gall to have it seized during the wake of the Hundred Years' War. We shall have the territory restituted as part of our state."
 FLA_northern_renaissance_title: "Northern Renaissance"
 FLA_northern_renaissance_desc: "Though it is Italy that is considered to be the progenitor of the Renaissance movement, it would be a travesty to leave the impact of the Netherlands out of the history of this revolutionary movement. The famed 'rebirth' may have started in the rich courts of the Italian city-states but Flanders could be considered its second catalyst, with other wealthy cities in the Low Countries experiencing prosperity and much patronage at the time."
 FLA_humanism_title: "Embrace Humanism"
 FLA_humanism_desc: "A new form of religious thought has been spreading throughout our people, pricing life above all, pushing for acceptance of all religious thought, and tolerance of unbelievers. It has been a great boon to our nation, with this religious thought practicing peaceful prosperity even as religious reform shakes the rest of europe. Many wise yet threatened thinkers have escaped to our cities, and now further our industries, trade, and technology. We might be able to invite the progenitor of this thought to our court, and bask in his innovative mind, given someone has not gotten ahead of us."
 FLA_revolt_of_ghent_title: "Revolt of Ghent"
 FLA_revolt_of_ghent_desc: "Recently, our Burgundian overlords have visited our peaceful city of Ghent. The subject of the visit was not one of good customs and politeness, but an announcement and demand of imposition of new taxes, namely a tax on salt and flour. The few heroic councillors that stood up to the Dukes were met with accusations and repressions, spurring much discontent amongst the guilds, who are now ready to fight."
 FLA_mechelen_title: "Defy Mechelen"
 FLA_mechelen_desc: "The Burgundian courts of Mechelen dared to pass judgements on our internal issues without our explicit permission or request. Though we may have defeated our former overlords and won our freedom, the vile judges in Mechelen still dare to act as arbiters in our internal conflicts. It is time we curb their enthusiasm."
 FLA_flemish_renaissance_title: "Flemish Renaissance"
 FLA_flemish_renaissance_desc: "Flanders was the locus of the Renaissance in the Low Countries. It is here that such famous painters as Hieronym us Bosch, Jan van Eyck and the Pieter Brueghels. The cause for such are more than a few, but the wealth of the flemish cities and the freedoms enjoyed by the citizens can be mentioned as the causes."
 FLA_zeeland_title: "Reconquer Zeeland"
 FLA_zeeland_desc: "The vast wetlands that form the Scheldt estuary inbetween the County of Holland and Flanders are known as Zeeland and they have been subject to dispute between the two for centuries. Unfortunately, the counts of Holland have recently gained an upper hand in the conflict, however that is subject to change under our ambitions."
 FLA_maas_title: "Across the Maas"
 FLA_maas_desc: "The Maas river forms a barrier between the northern Low Countries, dominated by the County of Holland, and the southern Netherlands, controlled by the Burgundian dukes. With our recent conquests, it is become imperative that we cross this important natural barrier and subdue the north."
 FLA_netherlands_title: "The United Provinces"
 FLA_netherlands_desc: "The states in the Low Countries are similar to each other in more ways than one. Those provinces, split across many different counties and states and ruled by many different foreign powers, need to be united together in one state that will be able to promote peace in the region and to bring order."
 FLA_drapieries_title: "Flemish Draperies"
 FLA_drapieries_desc: "The lifeblood of the Flemish economy are the weaver guilds and the value of the goods they produce. Their wares are known across Europe and make Flanders renowned for its high quality draperies."
 FLA_supply_title: "Acquire Woolen Supply"
 FLA_supply_desc: "In order to fuel our clothen economy, we need to acquire vast quantities of wool that could be used to produce more draperies. Such actions would fill our coffers and allow us to govern and rule more effectively."
 FLA_strike_france_title: "Strike France"
 FLA_strike_france_desc: "The French Kings as our foes are quite formidable and must be respected. In ages past, we had to swear fealty to them or their subjects. That age, however, has come to an end as our powerbase has grown stronger and our state is able to put up resistance against their wicked ambitions."
 FLA_unite_the_cities_title: "Unite the Cities"
 FLA_unite_the_cities_desc: "Though nominally not a city-state, our country is not so far from such state of affairs as the cities exert a massive amount of influence on our government. As their existence and prosperity is the lifeblood of the [Root.GetAdjective] nation, we must make sure to end their internal bickering once and for all."
 FLA_open_the_scheldt_title: "Open the Scheldt"
 FLA_open_the_scheldt_desc: "The Scheldt river and its estuary forms an important natural harbor for the promotion of trade and maritime exchange. Though the southern coast of the estuary is controlled by us, the rulers of Zeeland still hold much influence and hamper our trade in the area. We need to ensure this body of water is open."
 FLA_wealth_title: "Amass Wealth"
 FLA_wealth_desc: "Such prosperous existence on the crossroads of trade routes and within the richest region of Europe has lent us a chance to acquire vast quantities of gold. Let us continue to invest into ourselves and our situation so that in the future we will never need to worry about our fiscal security."

 ME_Flanders_Events.1.t: "The Holy Roman Protection"
 ME_Flanders_Events.1.d: "We have been approached with a most curious proposition. Being at the border of the Holy Roman Empire and many of our potential targets well within it, we could apply to join the block as a means to guarantee protection from the powerful French as well as to provide ourselves with an ability to have better influence in its internal affairs, especially as it would allow us to potentially wage war on our eastern and northern neighbors without much worry of external forces intervening in those affairs. All we need is the royal stamp and the envoy to be sent."
 ME_Flanders_Events.1.a: "We need their protection."
 ME_Flanders_Events.1.b: "We can do fine without."
 
 ME_Flanders_Events.2.t: "[From.GetName] Wishes to Join"
 ME_Flanders_Events.2.d: "Ambassadors from [From.GetName] have arrived in our court today. Though the presence of envoys from border states is hardly surprising, this time we have been met with quite a positive shock. The real purpose of the travel here was the request of the [From.GetAdjective] ruler to join the Holy Roman Empire. Though growing the empire is certainly a positive, accepting them could incur the wrath of the French who consider [From.GetName] to be in their sphere of influence."
 ME_Flanders_Events.2.a: "Come in!"
 ME_Flanders_Events.2.b: "It is too risky."
 
 ME_Flanders_Events.3.t: "Overthrow of Mechelen"
 ME_Flanders_Events.3.d: "During the Burgundian Rule, their puppet court in Mechelen dared to institute unlawful and unrepresentative taxes on our prosperous cities. It would seem that they were too envious of our flourishing economy. To respond to this threat of taxes we have staged an open rebellion in which we have won our freedoms.\n\nSome say that there is two things certain in life, death and taxes. It is clear to us that for anyone that tries to tax us, it is death that they will in turn receive.\n\nToday, we stand triumphant in possession of the city of Mechelen as well as with the unjust judges in our custody. We shall have them tried for their perjury and treason."
 ME_Flanders_Events.3.a: "Taxes shall be no more!"
