 SAPMISPAWNING.EVTNAME0:0 "The Emergence of the Sapmi Tribe"
 SAPMISPAWNING.EVTDESC0:0 "The uninhabited borderlands in the far north of Scandinavia have long been home to a small native population, but now, sensing the threat posed upon them by other nations, they have organized into a single confederacy. The Sami tribes of the North worship foreign gods and have a very distinct heritage from outselves and our people. It is now up to the court in $CAPITAL$ to decide what to do with this new nation. We could of course just ignore them, but the prospects of doing battle in such a hostile enviornment are attractive as training for our troops. Alternatively, some of our advisors are suggesting that we should grant them their other tribal lands - land that they claim belongs to their people or their faith."
 SAPMISPAWNING.0OPTION1:0 "We must repluse these pagans from the North!"
 SAPMISPAWNING.0OPTION2:0 "Make friends with these newcomers."

 SAPMISPAWNING.0OPTION5:0 "We can take the reins of this nation ourselves!"
 SAPMISPAWNING.0OPTION6:0 "Negotiate this land deal from the other side of the table."
 SAPMISPAWNING.2OPTION2:0 "Convince them that serving the court in $CAPITAL$ is in their best interest."
 SAPMISPAWNING.EVTNAME3:0 "The Sami Ancestral Lands"
 SAPMISPAWNING.EVTDESC3:0 "The land is rightfully theirs and we shall make peace with it. Instead we should forge relations that would benefits us both."
 SAPMISPAWNING.3OPTION1:0 "It is ours and ours alone."
 SAPMISPAWNING.3OPTION2:0 "May they be as they were."

 SO.EVTNAME27:0 "The Christian Faith's Presence in the Sami"
 SO.EVTDESC27:0 "The campaigns of liberation we have waged for a more complete picture have not been without victim: many have died on both sides for our unprecendented success as a nation. However, we are now confronted with the prospect of many of our subjects following not just a different religion, but an entirely different set of values and traditions! Perhaps we should embrace these as well - if we do, there will certianly be a chance to choose our flavor of Christianity."
 SO.27OPTION1:0 "Adopt this Abrahamic faith."
 SO.27OPTION2:0 "Our pagan tradition will remain solid."
 SO.EVTNAME28:0 "The Many Sects of Christianity"
 SO.EVTDESC28:0 "We have abandoned the old and outdated pagan traditions of our ancestors in favor of Chrisitianity. We must now pick which sect we will follow."
 SO.28OPTION1:0 "Catholicism will remain our faith."
 SO.28OPTION2:0 "A new and revitalized Christian faith will serve us nicely."

 SO.EVTNAME29:0 "The Finns and the Sami"
 SO.EVTDESC29:0 "Our recent conquest of the Finnish peninsula has led to a stunning realization: we are much like them, and them much like us. Our development as a people and as a tribe has been tied to the Finnish ethnic faith of Suomenusko, and many of our traditions are from our days inhabiting Finland. If we were to launch an initiative to assilimate the Finns into Sami culture, it would surely be successful. But the question remains: should we? Many in our cabinet and inner circle of power suggest that we should honor their traditions as we once wished the Europeans to. Either way, the Finns will be content."
 SO.29OPTION1:0 "Unite our two peoples."
 SO.29OPTION2:0 "Honor the unique Finnish tradition."

 smi_extra_title:0 "Reorganize the Tribe"
 smi_extra_desc:0 "Our recent expansions into ancestral lands in the North has come with many benefits, but we have not yet formulated an efficient way to govern this new land. It is time we reform the tribes to increase our direct control."
 smi_1_title:0 "Make Peace"
 smi_1_desc:0 "Our neighbors have been very kind to recognize our sovereignity, even if they may not agree with the principles of our tribe and the Sami people. We should seek closer ties with other nations in the geopolitical climate of Scandinavia, in order to ensure our independence."
 smi_2_title:0 "Make War"
 smi_2_desc:0 "The revelations granted to us by our more 'civilized' neighbors have helped us greatly in the art of doing battle. Perhaps we should wage war against them with our new tactical and strategic knowledge."
 smi_3_title:0 "The Other Gods"
 smi_3_desc:0 "Our new friends in our area have accepted the peace we gave to them. Now, they are suggesting to us that we should worship their other gods for our eternal salvation. This is an interesting proposition to our pagan government and our people."
 smi_4_title:0 "Deal for Laponia"
 smi_4_desc:0 "Our homeland in the North is mainly comprised of snowy wasteland or forests - areas that other nations care little for. Principally, the nations that occupy Laponia have little interest in governing the land - we should be able to take it from them."
 smi_5_title:0 "Pen and the Sword"
 smi_5_desc:0 "Our diplomatic and military prowess is on full display as we aim to reunite our people in the North. We should structure our diplomatic and militaristic standing around protecting our traditions."
 smi_6_title:0 "The Way of Warriors"
 smi_6_desc:0 "Our new campaigns of liberation have become engrained in our culture. We must aim to engrain in our people a fighting spirit, one that can stand up to tribal foes and imperialist ambitions alike."
 smi_7_title:0 "Go West"
 smi_7_desc:0 "Our new army can be used for many things - principally, invading weak nations. The Norwegian state has always been on the brink of ruin, so we should be able to sieze their northern coasts pretty easily."
 smi_8_title:0 "Great Friends"
 smi_8_desc:0 "Our Allies have taught us many things: of their gods, of their tactics, and of their state. We should seek to have more friends like these that not only trust us, but are trustworthy in and of themselves."
 smi_9_title:0 "Our People, As Well"
 smi_9_desc:0 "The finns to our immediate south share much with our people. By convincing them of the merit of our ways, we can - for all relevant purposes - integrate them into greater Sami culture. Or perhaps we should make them feel welcome as an independent entity, as our forefathers wished for us."
 smi_10_title:0 "Cultural Warriors"
 smi_10_desc:0 "Having engrained the spirit of battle in our troops we can now move to create a culture centered on service to the state and the great Sami cause. May our tribe live forever under the guiding hand of the people and the troops!"
 smi_11_title:0 "Go South"
 smi_11_desc:0 "Having bested Norway and the minor Swedish settlements in Norrland, we can move to conquering the Scandinavian heartland of Norway, Gotaland, Svealand, and Scania. With these new lands, our tribe will see great expansions in wealth, power, and influence."
 smi_12_title:0 "European Bartering"
 smi_12_desc:0 "The Europeans, justifiably stunned by our sudden ascension to power, have been reluctant to adopt our ways of commerce and economics. We can convince them, however, with some of this currency they hold so dearly. Maybe it holds merit, even."
 smi_13_title:0 "The New Barter System"
 smi_13_desc:0 "After our initial dealings with the Europeans, we have came to realize the use and merit of this new way of bartering, based around a common medium of exchange, what they call 'currency.' We should standardize this domestically."
 smi_14_title:0 "Reunite Our Own"
 smi_14_desc:0 "We have taken back the full extent of our tribal forefathers' claims over Scandinavia and secured the safety and liberties of both the Sami people and the followers of the $RELIGION$ faith. Now, we must remind our people and our neighbors of this indisputable truth."
 smi_15_title:0 "To Battle, We Ride!"
 smi_15_desc:0 "Having asserted our dominance over Scandinavia and the ways of the warrior we may proceed to lay waste to our 'more civilized' and 'more advanced' neighbors. They do not yet know the mistake they have made, but they soon will."
 smi_16_title:0 "Warmer Climates"
 smi_16_desc:0 "While we have found warmer weather via our conquest of Finnoscandia its still unsuitable for large cities that Europeans will bend knee to. We should aim to conquer across the Baltic and take their valuable farmlands for ourselves."
 smi_17_title:0 "Trade Through the Ice"
 smi_17_desc:0 "Our strong trade ships have been able to break through the ice of the North Sea and begin to conduct trade in the Narrow Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Sound Toll. If we could expand this new presence in European trade it would certianly lead to more wealth for our merchants and government."
 smi_18_title:0 "The Fur Trade"
 smi_18_desc:0 "One of our main exports through our years has been furs of the native species that inhabit our lands. Having a monopoly or near monopoly on the fur trade would likely be immensely profitable, especially considering that the fur industry is just beginning to take off in Europe."
 smi_19_title:0 "The Wood Trade"
 smi_19_desc:0 "The other main produce of our land has been wood, mainly hardened Norwegian wood for shipbuilding. Obviously we could use a great deal of this ourselves, but we have always produced in excess of our needs. A monopoly here would be more profitable than even the lucrative fur trade, as naval supplies are required by every coastal nation in the world."
 smi_20_title:0 "Tribal Ascendance"
 smi_20_desc:0 "Over our slow rise to power over these centuries we have gone from a backwater bankrupt minor tribe to a state that dominates the cultural, political, and geographical landscape of Europe. All that is left for eternal success is ensuring the stability of our nation - which should be easy given our homogenous population."
 smi_21_title:0 "Best our Foes"
 smi_21_desc:0 "We have conquered and smashed every single nation that has stood against us for our entire history. Now, however, we can truly - and correctly - claim to be unstoppable in our ambition and our drive."
