 bookmark_dismantledhre_desc: "The world lies shattered and broken, done so by weird phenomena, the lands embroiled in turmoil and war. Across every continent, old powers have dissolved completely and the nations that once were united under one flag now fly their own colors yet again, some old while others completely new.\n\nAs the world is shattered, new and old beliefs spur. Seeking answers for why humanity had behaved in such fragmented way.\n\nA shattered world is before you. Choose a nation and lead it to victory or perish in the ashes."
