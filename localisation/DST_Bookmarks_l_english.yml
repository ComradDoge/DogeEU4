 bookmark_vanillamap_desc: "I feel like I have already been here before.\nWith the many changes that the mod brings, it provides not only a shattered setting but also a much more balanced, more flavourful game experience. Enjoy!\nThere might be discrepencies from the actual vanilla (like rulers) so please do report.\nNote, stuff like truces at the start will likely be wrong (on purpose or not) due to how bookmarks are set up, so it's whatever."
