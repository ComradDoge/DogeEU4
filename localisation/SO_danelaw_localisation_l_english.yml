 SO.EVTNAME11:0 "The Norwegian Inheritance"
 SO.EVTDESC11:0 "Ever since the founding of the Kalmar Union in the late 14th century, Norway has always been the calmer of our two subjects. After the despots were quelled by the early 1400s, our rule over the people and lands of Norway has been largely uncontested by forces from within and from without. It has gotten to the point that intermarriage between Danish and Norwegian nobility is leaving Norwegian titles to Danes. It is time to simply incorporate Norway directly into our realm."

 SO.EVTNAME12:0 "The Great Lund Market"
 SO.EVTDESC12:0 "With our immense power and sway over Baltic trade granted to us by the geography of the Danish Sound Toll, it is no secret that our kingdom has been granted great wealth by the sea. In particular, the markets on the shores of Scania have seen immesurable business growth spurred by this Baltic trade, going as far to make Lund, not Copenhagen, our principal trading port. Yet, this great city remains without a royal charter to enhance their business. Granting one will surely expand our power and influence in the waters of the Sound Toll even further."

 SO.EVTNAME13:0 "Holstein and the Empire"
 SO.EVTDESC13:0 "The borderland client state of Holstein has long been contested between the Danish crown and the Holy Roman Empire. While our Holsteiner vassals hold sway over the land, the Holy Roman Empire maintains a, frankly, falsified claim that the land belongs to the Holy Roman Emperor by birthright. Now, we have entered a new round of negotiations over the land. Our diplomatic relations with the Emperor will surely have a massive impact on what will be done and the future of the relationship between Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire."
 SO.13OPTION1:0 "We will follow them in to the Holy Roman Empire."
 SO.13OPTION2:0 "Let us use our friendship with $EMPEROR$ to our advantage."

 SO.EVTNAME14:0 "The Thrones of Bavaria"
 SO.EVTDESC14:0 "The house of von Wittelsbach, recently elected to our throne, has ruled over the Bavarian countryside for centuries. The three disparate states that now rule the land have been a result of many succession crises where the Bavarian duke simply elected to split the realm. The three thrones in Munich, Ingolstadt, and Landshut have been claimed by our great nation, and now serve to be reunited by the von Wittelsbach fmaily once again, this time under the throne of Denmark."
 SO.14UNIVERSALOPTION:0 "Form this new Bavarian confederacy."
 SO.14OTHEROPTION:0 "Let us formalize and incorporate Bavaria as a throne in our realm."
 SO.EVTNAME15:0 "The Unification and Formalization of the Kalmar Union."
 SO.EVTDESC15:0 "Since the three crowns of Scandinavia were united under our throne in Copenhagen, we have struggled to maintain the stability and peace that our citizens so desperately need. Now, however, having directly inherited both Norway and Sweden, we can truly claim to be a united Kalmar Union. This is a great legacy to hold and will both stake our claim on the map and in the history books. Or, perhaps, we should form our own legacy."
 SO.15OPTION1:0 "Claim the glory of the Kalmar Union!"
 SO.15OPTION2:0 "We must forge our own legacy."
 SO.EVTNAME16:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the Kingdom of the Danelaw"
 SO.EVTDESC16:0 "With our recent conquest on the British Isles we have reclaimed our Viking legacy and ancestry. As the Danes did in those days, we can choose to establish the client state of the Danelaw, under none other than the descendants of the great Viking warrior Harald Hardrada. This would leave them to their own in domestic affairs but their foreign policy would still be Danish. Of course, we could continue to hold the land directly. But where's the fun in that?"
 SO.16OPTION1:0 "Re-establish this Kingdom of the Danelaw."
 SO.16OPTION2:0 "We must keep it as a personal royal holding."
 SO.16OPTION3:0 "We shall rule in the Danelaw!"
 SO.EVTNAME17:0 "The Swedish Inheritance"
 SO.EVTDESC17:0 "The road to Swedish inheritance was much more complicated. It seemed at every turn the Swedish nobility were trying to usurp us and declare themselves free of the Kalmar Union, so at every turn we fought them. Eventually it reached the point where we began to strip titles and holdings from them. With a little bloodshed and a little 'help' we were able to gradually transfer Sweden from Sweden to Denmark. Now we might as well inherit them, too."
 SO.17OPTION1:0 "The nobility is broken. We stand victorious in Sweden!"
 SO.EVTNAME18:0 "Renovations of Copenhagen"
 SO.EVTDESC18:0 "While the exact founding date of Copenhagen is a little hard to find, we can quite confidently place it around the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century. Regardless, it has largely been left to its own devices when it comes to upkeep and expansion; that's no way to administrate a capital city. We began renovations to modernize the city and promote the welfare of our citizens and now, as those draw to completion, there is great cause for celebration."
 SO.18OPTION1:0 "Renovations of Copenhagen are complete."
