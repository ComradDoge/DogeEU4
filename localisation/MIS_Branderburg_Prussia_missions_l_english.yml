The lands were finally divided between the Wittelsbach dukes of Palatinate-Neuburg (Jülich and Berge) and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, who gained Cleves with Mark and Ravensberg according to the 1614 Treaty of Xanten. The Hohenzollern margraves thereby got a first foothold in the Rhineland; however, large parts of the Duchy of Cleves were occupied by the United Provinces until the Franco-Dutch War in 1672.

Since 1731 Britain had been tied to Prussia's major rival Austria by the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. Prussia had been allied to Britain's enemy France. Following the War of the Austrian Succession during which she had lost the valuable province of Silesia, the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa tried to gain British support for a proposed military action to reclaim it. When the British government refused she grew disenchanted with them - and in 1756 made an alliance with France. Suddenly without a major ally in continental Europe, the British hastily concluded a similar pact with Frederick the Great of Prussia hoping it would forestall a major European war by maintaining the European balance of power."

By the end of the First Silesian War in 1742, the Prussian forces had conquered almost all of the Habsburg crown land, while according to the peace treaties of Breslau and Berlin, only some smaller parts in the extreme southeast, like the Duchy of Teschen as well as the southern parts of the duchies of Troppau and Nysa, remained possessions of the Habsburg Monarchy as Austrian Silesia. Attempts by Maria Theresa to regain the crown land in the Second Silesian War (1744–1745) failed and she ultimately had to relinquish her claims by the Treaty of Dresden. The Seven Years' War (1756–1763) once again confirmed Prussian control over most of Silesia, and due to its predominantly Protestant population especially in Lower Silesia, it became one of the most loyal territories of the House of Hohenzollern."

A total of six other claimants appeared, with rulers of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and Duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg having the only credible claims through their marriage to Johann Wilhelm's aunts.

pru_educated_tolerance_desc:0 "John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg converted to Calvinism in 1613, but his subjects remained predominantly Lutheran. Brandenburg-Prussia would henceforth be a bi-confessional state in which both Lutheranism and Calvinism were official religions. The Electors of Brandenburg already tolerated Catholicism in Ducal Prussia, which lay outside the borders of the Holy Roman Empire and was held in fief to the King of Poland. In 1747, Frederick the Great gave permission for a Catholic cathedral, St. Hedwig's Cathedral, to be built in the predominantly-Lutheran capital city of Berlin. Over the intervening centuries between the acquisition of Prussian titles and establishment of the proto-German state the dukes, and later Kings, of Brandenberg-Prussia would balance religious tolerance at the expense of increased taxes on church revenues."
pru_religious_acceptance_title:0 "Individual Tolerance"
pru_religious_acceptance_desc:0 "The idea of individual religious tolerance on a national level was not addressed by the Peace of Augsburg, and neither the Reformed nor Radical churches (Calvinists and Anabaptists being the prime examples) were protected. Many Protestant groups living under the rule of a Lutheran prince still found themselves in danger of the charge of heresy. Tolerance was not officially extended to Calvinists until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and most Anabaptists eventually relocated to the New World or were exterminated. Although cuius regio, eius religio gave princes the right to impose their own religion on their subjects, some rulers found it more expedient to tolerate religions that were already in place. This tolerance would extend in some limited fashion to certain non-Christian communities as well, though Jews would still find themselves routinely persecuted throughout the Renaissance and modern eras."
pru_army_country_title:0 "Army With a Country"
pru_army_country_desc:0 "Starting with the establishment of garrisons in Brandenberg and Prussia, the Prussian army slowly slowly evolved into a state apparatus with deep ties across all of Prussian social strata. In 1776 the Prussian army consisted of 187,000 soldiers, 90,000 of whom were Prussian subjects in central and eastern Prussia. The remainder were foreign (both German and non-German) volunteers or conscripts. By the end of Frederick Williams's reign, the army had become nearly inseparable from Prussian society and numbered 200,000 soldiers, making it the third largest in Europe after the armies of Russia and Austria. The social classes were all expected to serve the state and its army — the nobility led the army, the middle class supplied the army, and the peasants composed the army. This reality led Minister Friedrich von Schrötter to remark that, ''Prussia is not a country with an army, but an army with a country''."

The Sture Party were supported by the peasants and burgesses which often resulted in conflict with the church and the nobility in the Privy Council who more often supported the Union. The Sture and their supporters on several occasions courted open rebellion against the Danish crown over the former's elevation of Danish nobles to traditionally Swedish county lordships and a general disregard of Swedish rights and customs as well as Denmark's frequent wars with Schleswig, Holstein, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and the Hanseatic League which often brought exports to a halt."

Erik Johansson Vasa, a minor noble, was executed for his resistance to Danish encroachment on traditionally Swedish county titles and his son Gustav quickly raised a rebellion in response.  In 1521, Gustav Vasa sought the support of several foreign powers to aid in his rebellion, including the Hanseatic city of Lubeck and several German potentates through his familial ties to house of Oldenburg. Gustav and his allies succeeded in crushing the armies of the Danish king at the Battle of Brunbäcks färja."

pru_german_holstein_desc:0 "The Treaty of Ribe promulgated by King Christian I of Denmark to a number of Holsatian nobles enabled him to become Count of Holstein and regain control of Denmark's lost Duchy of Schleswig. The most famous line of the proclamation was that the Danish Duchy of Schleswig and the County of Holstein within the Holy Roman Empire, should now be, in the original Middle Low German language, Up Ewig Ungedeelt, or "Forever Undivided". The proclamation was issued in 1460 and established that the King of Denmark should also be Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein. Another clause gave the nobility the right to revolt should the king break the agreement. The Danish King was forbidden from annexing Holstein to Denmark and Holstein retained its independence and its position as a subfief of Saxony, indirectly under the Holy Roman Emperor. The German majority in the Duchy resisted repeated Danish efforts to violate that clause and incorporate the demesne with Denmark proper, leading to several wars with Prussia in the latter half of the 19th century. Ultimately, Holstein was annexed into Prussia, with the northern county of Schleswig retained by the Danes."

In 1633, during its war against Spain (which then controlled Portugal), the Netherlands seized control of Arguin. It remained under Dutch rule until 1678, with a brief interruption by English rule in 1665. France took over the island in September 1678, but it was then abandoned until 1685. In 1685  Captain Reers of the Brandenburger frigate Rother Löwe occupied the old Portuguese fort on the island. He successfully concluded a treaty with the native king in which Brandenburg was accepted as a protecting power. The treaty was ratified in 1687 and was renewed in 1698. Arguin remained a colony of Brandenburg until 1721 when the French successfully assaulted the fort and then took control of the island."

On 15 January 1701, the colony was renamed Prussian Gold Coast Settlements, in connection with the founding of the Prussian kingdom, which formally took place three days later, when Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, crowned himself King in Prussia.
