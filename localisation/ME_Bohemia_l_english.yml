We must be cautious and draft a treaty based on what our future aspirations shall be. Regardless of what we choose, our victory against one of our biggest rivals has been cemented in the books of history." 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.1.a: "Issue immediate re-education orders!"
  FU_Bohemian_Events.1.b: "This weakness can be exploited..."

  FU_Bohemian_Events.2.b: "We shall never surrender!"
 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.3.t: "The Zwinger" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.3.d: "The Zwinger is a palatial complex with gardens in Dresden. It is one of the most important buildings in Saxony. Designed to hold guests from the highest and mightiest houses, the Palace is one of the largest in Europe. Its capture will allow us to hold lavish feasts to celebrate our victory over the Saxons and further legitimize our rule as well as furthering our agenda and our prestige."
  FU_Bohemian_Events.3.a: "Let the feasts commence!"
  
  FU_Bohemian_Events.4.t: "Revenge for Nikopolis" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.4.d: "The late 14th century saw the destruction of a combined force funded by christian monarchs, in Nikopolis. The Crusade of Nikopolis concluded with an undisputed victory on behalf of the Ottoman side and paved the way for further conquest on the expense of their christian Balkan neighbors. However, time has proven our resilience unyielding and we have once again clashed with this old foe. Despite setbacks we have managed to declare victory against the sick man of Europe and reclaim long lost territory!"
  FU_Bohemian_Events.4.a: "Victory is ours!"
  
  FU_Bohemian_Events.5.t: "Cathedral of St. Vitus" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.5.d: "The Metropolitan Cathedral of Saints Vitus, Wenceslaus and Adalbert is a Roman Catholic metropolitan cathedral in Prague, the seat of the Archbishop of Prague.

The city of Pilsen began brewing in 1295, but until recent decades, most Bohemian beers were top-fermented. The taste and standards of quality often varied widely, and in [GetYear], consumers dumped whole barrels to show their dissatisfaction. The officials of Pilsen founded a city-owned brewery in [GetYear], called Mestansky Pivovar Plzen or the Citizens' Brewery, which was to brew beer in the pioneering Bavarian style, after the conquest of the aforementioned lands by the Bohemian Crown." 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.7.a: "Bottoms up!" 
 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.8.t: "Aftermath of the Hussite Wars" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.8.d: "The Hussite Wars (often referred to as the Hussite Revolution) were a series of wars fought between the Christian Hussites and the combined Christian Catholic forces of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, the Papacy, European monarchs loyal to the Catholic Church, as well as various Hussite factions. After initial clashes, the Utraquists, known as the open-minded and tolerant branch of the Hussite faith, changed sides in 1432 to fight alongside Roman Catholics and opposed the Taborites and other Hussite spinoffs, who wanted no compromise with Catholicism. These wars lasted from 1419 to approximately 1434 and left Bohemia in ruins." 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.8.a: "Only the dead have seen the end of war..." 
 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.9.t: "The Succession of Jiri z Podebrad" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.9.d: "Jiri was the sixteenth King of Bohemia, who ruled Bohemia during the second half of the 15th century. He was a leader of the Hussites, however, canonically moderate and tolerant toward the Catholic faith. His rule was marked by great efforts to preserve peace and tolerance between the Hussites and Catholics in the religiously divided Crown of Bohemia – hence his contemporary nicknames: "King of two peoples" (kral dvojiho lidu) and "Friend of peace" (pritel miru). \n\nDespite his positive impact on the country, essentially saving Bohemia from the catastrophic aftermath of the Hussite Wars, his line was not royal or legitimate by any standards of the time. As a result, despite the potential of an heir, outside forces seek to tear our nation apart by actively mingling in our succession." 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.9.a: "We must align with our Polish brethren" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.9.b: "Let us serve the royal house of Hungary, if we must."
  FU_Bohemian_Events.9.c: "Bohemia stands free and proud!"
 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.10.t: "The Duchy of Prussia" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.10.d: "Ducal Prussia has been a title resting under the jurisdiction of the Polish Crown. Due to our recent conquests in the Baltic areas, we are given the unique opportunity of restoring the famous Duchy under our control and in return gain a loyal subject, whose prestigious and excellent armies will be at our Monarch's beck and call for generations to come..."

  FU_Bohemian_Events.10.b: "Our land, our rules."

  FU_Bohemian_Events.12.t: "Reformatio Sigismundi"
  FU_Bohemian_Events.12.d: "Emperor Sigismund had big plans for the proper administration of the Holy Roman Empire. Unbeknownst to him, we are in the pleasant position of applying his theoretical designs in regards to the handling of the vast territories under our jurisdiction. For the first time in centuries our radical reforms shall bring Bohemia into the spotlight of European Affairs and contribute in the creation of a melting pot between the West Slavic and the Germanic people, resulting in less unrest and the legitimization of our rule." 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.12.a: "It's time to reform the Empire!"
 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.13.t: "Confessio Bohemica" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.13.d: "The Bohemian Confession, Latin Confessio Bohemica, is a Protestant doctrinal statement formulated in Bohemia by the Czech Utraquists (moderate Hussites) in [GetYear] and subscribed to by the Unitas Fratrum, Lutherans, and Calvinists in the kingdom. The document was based on the Augsburg Confession, and it upheld the Lutheran position on justification and the Calvinist interpretation of the Eucharist. Though [Root.Monarch.GetName] withheld formal approval of the Confession, he orally guaranteed religious freedom to the Protestants of Bohemia. Eventually pressure mounted and the monarch was called to grant recognition to Bohemia’s Protestants with his Letter of Majesty. Previously, the Unitas Confession , introduced by Martin Luther and published by him at Wittenberg as a sign of agreement between Lutherans and Utraquists, had been presented to Emperor Ferdinand I for legal recognition, but without success."
  FU_Bohemian_Events.13.a: "Sign the legislation for the good of the realm." 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.13.t: "Refuse!" 
 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.14.t: "The Second Statuta Judaeorum" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.14.d: "Bohemia has a long history of being a melting pot of religions as well as religious minorities. Many non-christians have sought refuge behind our walls from persecution elsewhere, such as the followers of Judaism. In fact, for centuries now they have enjoyed relative peace and an ample variety of rights and privileges due to their endangered status across Europe. As the Reformation shakes the foundation of the Catholic Church, the status of rights for minorities such as the Jewish Community has once again come into question by various zealous elements within our court."
  FU_Bohemian_Events.14.a: "Bohemia is and shall remain a safe haven for Jews."
  FU_Bohemian_Events.14.b: "They are not welcome here!"
 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.15.t: "Greatness from Small Beginnings" 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.15.d: "Henry lived in the tranquil village of Silver Skalitz, training to be a blacksmith under Martin, his father, at their forge. In between lessons, he'd often go about horsing around with his friends - Fritz, Matthew, and Matthias - while wooing Bianca, the local alemaid and his sweetheart. He eventually begins learning the basics of warfare and sword fighting in secret by Vanyek, much to his mother's disapproval, eager to one day join the forces of the famous Jan Zizka himself. \n\nDuring his first years in adulthood, Henry and his father finish making a masterwork sword for their liege lord, Sir Radzig Kobyla. Henry soon learnt that, in addition to being a skilled swordsmith, his father had some talent in sword fighting as well. Henry longed to venture into the outside world, so he asked his father to teach him how to defend himself, but Martin refuses, preferring him to settle down with a nice girl, learn his blacksmith's trade, and keep away from trouble. \n\nHowever, this peaceful life was soon to be interrupted. In the early 15th century an army commanded by Markvart von Aulitz, one of Austria's lieutenants, attacked and destroyed Skalitz - becoming an event later known as the Sack of Skalitz - as revenge on Sir Radzig for sending valuable silver and his continues loyalty towards the last King of Bohemia. \n\nThis made Henry seek a career in swordmanship, inevitably, or rather eventually, studying under the great Jan Zizka himself, later becoming a formidable commander himself." 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.15.a: "He would make a fine leader!"
  FU_Bohemian_Events.15.b: "The son of a smith? Bah!" 
 
  FU_Bohemian_Events.16.t: "Trade Good Choice"
  FU_Bohemian_Events.16.d: "The mission gives a choice of whether you want the Paper Trade Good in [Root.GetName]."
  FU_Bohemian_Events.16.a: "Paper is how the empires administrate."
  FU_Bohemian_Events.16.b: "I like it the way it is."
