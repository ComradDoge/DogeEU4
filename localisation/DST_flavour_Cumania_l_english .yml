 dse_flavour_cumania.1.d: "The times have changed drastically, the political entities of the lands have shattered and changed completely for no apparent reason. We must now live within this new world and find a new path. The question is what kind it should be? Should we return to our ancestral ways of raiders and pillagers, after all the lands are ripe for the taking. Or should we stay as the settler that we have become, perhaps even with a change of faith?"
