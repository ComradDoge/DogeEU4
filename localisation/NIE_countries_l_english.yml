 NUA_ideas_start: "Nahua Traditions"
 NUA_ideas_bonus: "Nahua Ambition"
 blood_for_the_gods_above: "The Shedding of Blood"
 blood_for_the_gods_above_desc: "Our religious traditions are steeped in bloody sacrifices, for the gods deemed it necessary for us to do so. Those who came across the great waters to our land know not of these religious principles and instead want us to embrace their own, but their bloodless rituals will not sustain the world. We will guide them by force or by coercion to what is truly meant for this realm."
 meritocratic_military_ranks: "Ranks of the Nahua"
 meritocratic_military_ranks_desc: "The Aztecs and those around them blessed the greater region of Nahua people with military skills, but corruption in the form of noble bloodlines and wealthy individuals seeking to buy ranks in the military are what hold us back. Let us embark on a path that leads to a more skillful and merit-based military ranking system that relies on actual fighting technique and military knowledge."
 jade_gold_artwork: "Jade and Gold Artwork"
 jade_gold_artwork_desc: "The work of our artisans and sculptors is perhaps something that is enviable by all nations around us. The Nahua people are well versed in making beautiful artwork out of jade and gold which are prized not only by our own people, but by people in many other regions too. Such a lasting legacy will never be forgotten in this world."
 refine_the_colonizing_system: "Resurgence of the Nahua"
 refine_the_colonizing_system_desc: "We have triumphed over the deathly blows our enemies across the water sought to deal to us, learning and cultivating a new and revitalized state for the Nahua people. Now the task is to spread forth, claim what lands are rightfully ours, and bring forth a new age of dominance stemming from our heartland."
 refine_the_tributary_system: "New Nahua Tributaries"
 refine_the_tributary_system_desc: "The way warfare was back during the time of Aztec dominance in the region led to subjugation of smaller alteptls, exacting tribute from them in the form of slaves, prisoners-of-war, or food and resources. Now that times have changed, we must take to refining that old way of warfare and subjugation whilst also instituting a more structured way of exacting tribute from our subjects."
 cultivation_of_harsh_land: "Cultivation of Harsh Land"
 cultivation_of_harsh_land_desc: "The jungles and highlands of our native region are not the easiest to make do with. We have managed to build great buildings and grand farming structures sure, but with new technology and ideas coming into our society at a consistent rate, we would be better off cultivating the land with more advanced methods. Chinampas and other farming methods, as an example, could be vastly improved with the new equipment we have been able to obtain."
 currency_transition: "Minting Nahua Coinage"
 currency_transition_desc: "The currency of the international markets is not what our ancestors would have used at all. Whilst our military traditions are stronger than many others, our finances are going to lag behind if we cannot start minting our own coins and controlling the flow of money into and out of Nahua territory. Thus, a large scale endeavor will be needed to start this process, but we will get it done in time."
  SCF_ideas: "Great Sioux Ideas"
 SCF_ideas_start: "Great Sioux Traditions"
 SCF_ideas_bonus: "Great Sioux Ambition"
 foundations_of_a_nation: "Founding the Seven Council Fires"
 foundations_of_a_nation_desc: "Some would say we were pushed into this position whilst others would say it was inevitable that our seven groups of people would come together like this. External forces have helped push us in this direction undoubtedly and it is felt by all who assemble by the Seven Council Fires that strength and determination must come through unity. Through this unity, we will expand our borders outward and make allies out of the other tribal people we come to encompass."
 councils_of_the_nakota: "The Wichiyena Councils"
 councils_of_the_nakota_desc: "The Wichiyena (otherwise known as the Nakota though this is a misnomer) encompass the Yankton and Yanktonai peoples and their history as the middle Sioux has been integral to the very heart of our confederacy. Unlike the other councils, they are less oriented to warfare and are more keen on internal matters like societal cohesion as opposed to making new warrior societies. It is with the words of these two that the nation will thrive with administrative prowess."
 reformation_of_sioux_politics: "Reform the Political Structure"
 reformation_of_sioux_politics_desc: "The previous tribal makeup of the Sioux people has had a lasting effect on relations at all levels of society. From small-scale communities to previous chiefs who are now leaders with different titles, tribal feuds and debts are still seen as playing a large part in our politics and it makes for a great number of messy endeavors, unfortunately. By making a concentrated effort to make sure these old feuds and debts are repaid and resolved, we can ensure that the nation is strong at its very core."
 councils_of_the_lakota: "The Teton Councils"
 councils_of_the_lakota_desc: "The Teton (otherwise known as the Lakota) most disciplined and war-like group within our nation. Comprising of three councils (the Northern, Central, and Southern Lakota) and showing just how fierce they are when fighting other people on the plains, it should come as no surprise that they wield a great amount of influence. Balancing out their power and influence with the others is key, and utilizing their adaptation to the changing technologies of warfare will serve to help modernize us as a whole."
 plains_warfare: "Ruthless Plains Warfare"
 plains_warfare_desc: "The Great Plains is where the bison roam and where several people groups come to clash over hunting grounds and territorial rights. We are no stranger to this at all, and with the dawn of the age of gunpowder weapons well upon us, it would do us well to utilize this power on horseback and on foot. The shock of cavalry charges and long range skirmishing on either horseback or on foot will serve to drive out any enemy of the Seven Council Fires."
 councils_of_the_dakota: "The Santee Councils"
 councils_of_the_dakota_desc: "The Santee (otherwise known as the Dakota) have brought their experience in from the east when they were defeated by the Ojibwe people around Lake Superior. The integration of their traditions and customs from outside the Great Plains has helped our nation become more welcoming of outsiders, though that does not mean we will let foreigners seize land from us unfairly. What happened to the Santee will not happen to us and we will be sure of it."
 seven_fires_to_light_our_way: "Seven Fires Light the Way"
 seven_fires_to_light_our_way_desc: "As we look to the future, it is very much a shroud of fog that we can't see past. Some are scared of what lurks behind the fog, could disaster await the Sioux people? Or could there be a great age of Sioux expansion and prosperity? Whatever is waiting for us in the future, the Seven Council Fires will be there to light the way for a strong, unified, and capable people. No matter the challenge we may face, the Sioux will bring all they can against it and overcome it."
  NSE_ideas: "North Sea Ideas"
 NSE_ideas_start: "North Sea Traditions"
 NSE_ideas_bonus: "North Sea Ambition"
 cnut_the_greats_empire: "Homage to Cnut the Great"
 cnut_the_greats_empire_desc: "The forebearer of our great empire, Cnut the Great, united the crowns of the Denmark, England, and Norway into one single political entity that was decentralized to a good degree. Following in Cnut's footsteps, we should not mistreat the churches or locals of the lands we conquer but instead slowly but surely bring the laws of Denmark upon them. Integration rather than straight and bloody conquest and the pillaging of each and every house we find is what we need."
 rulers_of_the_north_sea: "Rulers of the North Sea"
 rulers_of_the_north_sea_desc: "The North Sea is a prosperous and vital place that many ships cross through for trade and combat. Taking control of it entirely is what allowed the North Sea Empire of our ancestors to thrive and exert control over vast stretches of land. Our resurgent control of the North Sea will only serve to help propel our naval power to the ends of the Earth."
 divide_and_rule: "Divide and Rule"
 divide_and_rule_desc: "The concept of 'divide and conquer/rule' is not a new one since the it has been employed in the times of the Greeks and Romans from centuries before. The North Sea Empire is perhaps another beneficiary of such a political outline since dividing up our lands and our territories into certain departments, provinces, and sectors can ease the burden on our administration as a whole."
 fierce_norse_fighters: "Ferocity of Norse Fighters"
 fierce_norse_fighters_desc: "Norse fighters, from the lands of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, are renowned for their ferocity and might. Though not the most disciplined or the most technologically advanced at times, they were universally seen as fearsome and courageous warriors that were to be feared. This legacy lives on in the blood of our soldiers to this very day and we will see to it that they fight with the same valor as people from our lands did in centuries past!"
 english_administrative_structures: "Comprehensive Administration"
 english_administrative_structures_desc: "The English have developed certain administrative structures and techniques that Denmark well, has struggled to develop over the decades. Mired by political struggles in the north and south, we could can and should incorporate some of the English techniques of administration into our own so that we can better manage the vast swathes of land in the North Sea Empire."
 enforce_danelaw: "Rekindle and Expand the Danelaw"
 enforce_danelaw_desc: "The Danelaw was both an administrative structure used by the Danes from the 880s onward (after the formalization of the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum in 886) and a term for where the Danes took control of and held sway in the British Isles. It is only right that the North Sea Empire revive the Danelaw and refine it over time, bringing the Isles closer into fold of the Danes and more prosperous as a whole."
 might_of_the_north_sea_empire: "The Might of the North Sea"
 might_of_the_north_sea_empire_desc: "From the mighty northern waters, fjords, and coasts is where we of the North Sea Empire shall descend upon the world. Our military and navy will be ready to fend off any invasion into our lands and after the pikes of our enemies shatter upon our shields, we will repay them for what they did with added interest. Truly, we are the 'Lineal for hele Nordsøen', ruler of the entire North Sea."
  WKU_ideas: "Wokou Ideas"
 WKU_ideas_start: "Wokou Traditions"
 WKU_ideas_bonus: "Wokou Ambition"
 dismantle_coastal_forts: "Dismantle Coastal Fortifications"
 dismantle_coastal_forts_desc: "The coasts of our adversaries are being fortified as it is against our efforts but this will not stand for long. We need to strengthen the weaponry on our ships and train our sailors better so that they can more effectively take down fortification after fortification from a distance. None near the water will be able to withstand the might of the Wokou for long!"
 force_open_trade_routes: "Force Open Trade Routes"
 force_open_trade_routes_desc: "The Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans are continually trying to block all trade with us. Few families and clans are willing to open their trade routes to us, meaning that many of our markets are starved of (shady) customers and merchants alike. This must be put to and end somehow; we must force open these trade routes by any means so that we can feel the blood that is trade flow smoothly again."
 command_the_waters: "Commanding the Waters"
 command_the_waters_desc: "The seas and open waters are valuable to many from all over the regions around us. Plenty of trading potential and power to be gained from controlling these waters, right? Well then we should capitalize on our already shady presence and make sure that the waters stretching from Northern Japan to Southern China are ours and only ours!"
 repurpose_enemy_ships: "Repurpose Enemy Ships"
 repurpose_enemy_ships_desc: "Not all of our enemies ships are useless once we defeat them, this is a simple fact we need to observe. Along with this, our own docks and harbors are not as high quality as those of China, Japan, or Korea, thus our capability to build ships is much more limited than many others around us. If we can effectively repair captured enemy ships and man them with enough sailors loyal to the Wokou, we can bolster our fleet numbers without nearly as much effort or resource spent."
 gunpowder_convoy_raids: "Gunpowder Convoy Raids"
 gunpowder_convoy_raids_desc: "Gunpowder is shipped around the waters we inhabit regularly and along coastal routes without end, meaning these transport routes are easily open to raids by our sailors and military. The more gunpowder we raid for and store up, the more firepower we will have later on for our ships and for our military, both of which we will need if we are to sustain our grip on power."
 multi_ethnic_formation: "The Many Wokou"
 multi_ethnic_formation_desc: "The Wokou are not just one simply population of people of Japanese, Korean, or Chinese descent, but rather it is an amalgamation of people from various cultural groups who have come together to take on a new life, one that promises better treatment and opportunity than what their previous life offered. Even the ones we capture eventually come around to joining the Wokou and with all these cultures within our ranks, it'd be wise for us to unite with them rather than discriminate against them."
 age_of_the_wokou: "The Age of the Wokou"
 age_of_the_wokou_desc: "They fight to keep us down, but the spirit and might of the Wokou cannot be tamed so easily. We do not readily submit to foreign authority like we all once had before and we will continually strive for an age where we are in charge. The age of the Wokou will come forth in some form or another, or we will die trying to see it through."
  RRR_ideas: "Russian Ideas"
 RRR_ideas_start: "Russian Traditions"
 RRR_ideas_bonus: "Russian Ambition"
 representation_of_russian_people: "Represent the Russian People"
 representation_of_russian_people_desc: "The Veche is the foundational building block of our republic and we must always hold it in high regard just as we did in decades before. From boyars to merchants to common citizens, they can and will be heard by the authorities of the land; they will be represented in our govenment when legislation is being passed and reforms are being made, and it is through them that Russia will be held up and propelled forward."
 system_of_tribute_and_taxes: "System of Tribute and Taxes"
 system_of_tribute_and_taxes_desc: "Through the legislative system of councils and magistrates in place, we can institute our republican values elsewhere. Though monarchs still thrive in this age, the ideals we hold as a republic can help mend and boost relations between us and our subjects who lie further away from the heart of the Russian Republic. Better this than enforcing harsh tribute on them and executing their officials on the spot for small matters, no, we must compromise and seek resolutions with them in a just and righteous way."
 strengthen_democratic_institutions: "Strengthen Republican Institutions"
 strengthen_democratic_institutions_desc: "We need not fall back into the times before the Veche was at our core, back to the days of princes and boyars running politics and abusing the peasants of the land like they were near slaves that they owned. Every adult Russian citizen in the Russian Republic must and will have a say in the legislative process. The council members as well as magistrates must adhere to the ideals we have had for decades now and we will be enforcing them at all possible points. It is through this triumph of republican values over the ones of monarchy that we will carve a future that is truly bright and glorious for the Russian people."
 beyond_the_urals: "Beyond the Urals"
 beyond_the_urals_desc: "The Ural Mountains were once the stopping point of the people of Novgorod; the tribes of the Urals had to pay tribute to Novgorod regularly though, times have certainly changed since they last paid tribute in that manner. We must now look past the Urals and toward the east where vast open swathes of land that can help maintain the strength of our republic and help ensure its prosperity for the future. Though the various tribes of the cold tundra and forests may resent us at first, they will learn to accept our authority over them."
 promoting_russian_arts: "Promote Russian Art"
 promoting_russian_arts_desc: "With several Eastern Orthodox Churches in our land as well as a magnificent cultural history backing the us up, it is no wonder that Russian art and architecture is able to flourish under us. The old days of monarchy restrained artistic styles at times, but we can become true patrons of many styles and develop a uniquely cultured feel to the landscape that few other nations can boast about. Not only this, but the marvelously built churches have also served to deepen the faith of our people, leading to more internal stability throughout Russian land."
 baltic_dominance: "Baltic Dominance"
 baltic_dominance_desc: "The Neva River and its bay have been crucial for trade opportunities and also for the Russian navy to get its start. The Baltic may traditionally be home to the Swedes, the Danish, and the Finnish, but the Russians are now becoming a key player too thanks to a multitude of factors. If we can secure more Baltic trade for ourselves and expand our shipyards further along the coast, we'll be able to reap control away from the pesky Scandinavians."
 reformed_military_standards: "Reformed Military Standards"
 reformed_military_standards_desc: "To defend the Russian Republic will require the utmost discipline and fighting power. We are not so entrenched in the past that we are going to fire arrows at our enemies who fire lead shot back at us, instead we will readily adopt the new firearms being used by other powers and incorporate them into our military so that they can use the new military standards devised in conjunction with modern weaponry. If we let our military become decadent, we risk losing the entire republic from war itself."
 MGB_ideas: "Maghrebi Ideas"
 MGB_ideas_start: "Maghrebi Traditions"
 MGB_ideas_bonus: "Maghrebi Ambition"
 pacify_the_berbers: "Placate the Berbers"
 pacify_the_berbers_desc: "Despite the numbers of Moroccans, Tunisians, and Algerians around North Africa, the Berbers are still very powerful and very influential in politics around the various areas we control. We must meet with them on equal terms and accept them as our own so that we do not invoke their ire. Should we turn our backs on the numerous Berber tribes in our borders, we could face a civil war the likes of which few have ever seen before."
 caliphate_status: "Caliphate Ideals"
 caliphate_status_desc: "The Caliphates of the past have stretched across the Maghreb in centuries past, leaving lasting influences on the various people that still remain in the Maghreb. Though some Islamic theologians preach different doctrines and ideals within our borders, we strive for something that nearly all within our borders agree with: the status of a being a caliphate. Like our ancestors of the Almohad and Fatimid Caliphates and our kin from the Rashidun, Corodoba, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates, we will follow in their footsteps and spread the word of the prophet Muhammad to all corners of our thriving nation."
 masterful_defenses: "Defensive Mastery"
 masterful_defenses_desc: "The ally of the Maghrebi people has always been defensive strategies since the arid land we inhabit is inherently hard to attack into. Where we live, the Christians of the north have strived to conquer before but have succumbed to the likes of the natural terrain whilst we were able to maintain ourselves in well placed defensive positions. Let us compound upon this mentality in the future and prepare even better defenses in the future for any invader who thinks that the Maghreb is an easy target for conquest."
 command_north_african_trade: "North African Trade"
 command_north_african_trade_desc: "The lucrative trade across North Africa is prized by many since it provides an alternative to the Christians across the sea. Not only this, but the Saharan trade routes also rely on trade routes throughout North Africa thus making our position even more lucrative. Capitalizing upon this and trying to make Maghrebi merchants and markets skilled and valuable will yield greater trade profits for the entirety of the region. If we're good enough at this, we might even be seen as a better alternative to the Christians in time!"
 maghrebi_guard: "Royal Maghrebi Guard"
 maghrebi_guard_desc: "We must not be as reliant on mercenaries and levied armies as much as we have before; the loyalty of these kinds of armies is fickle and prone to change when the tides of war change. The Maghreb must have its own professional, standing army that can help maintain the integrity of the entire nation better than any levied or mercenary-based army. This transition is going to take a fair amount of time and some groups within the Maghreb will not like this change, but we must be ready to adapt to the coming changes of the future."
 promote_barbary_pirates: "Corsair Traditions"
 promote_barbary_pirates_desc: "What else is the coast of the Maghreb known for? Piracy! Corsairs! Privateers! They've played a role in Maghrebi history for centuries now and have helped maintain the power of Maghrebi people against Christians to the north, therefore it is only natural that we would continue to fund and use them to our advantage. Let the coasts of our enemies and the merchant ships of our rivals know no peace!"
 formal_maghrebi_nation: "Formalize the Maghrebi Nation"
 formal_maghrebi_nation_desc: "Tribal confederacies and small kingdoms battling each other for dominance in battle, sometimes joining because of dynastic ties and breaking up because of petty disputes, the Maghreb has seen a very colorful history in this regard. This is, however, very much just that, history, for now we are ready to ascend to a new state that is beyond these squabbles and disputes. The dream of a united Maghreb is finally upon us and we must be ready to keep its administration in the best condition possible as it serves the people by promoting prosperity, growth, and unity."
  ANV_ideas: "Angevin Ideas"
 ANV_ideas_start: "Angevin Traditions"
 ANV_ideas_bonus: "Angevin Ambition"
 the_two_domains: "The Two Domains"
 the_two_domains_desc: "England and France are both vast in their stretches of land and diverse in the people who fought for both. By uniting them together into one single political entity, we can combine the forces through various integrative efforts and make a unified military for the Angevin Realm itself, one that is proud, brave, and courageous enough to stand against the foes of Europe."
 inter_disciplinary_standards: "Inter-Disciplinary Standards"
 inter_disciplinary_standards_desc: "Across the Channel on both sides, the standards for military service may have been different in some senses, but they were also similar in other regards. By refining both and taking the best from both the English and the French ways of training and disciplining troops, those of the Angevin Realm can benefit from the highest quality training around."
 subjects_of_the_crowns: "Subjects of the Crowns"
 subjects_of_the_crowns_desc: "When Henry II was around to claim a majority of what is considered Angevin, there were several subject feudatories that held the realm together. Though we are more centralized now, we still rely on subject states here and there and as such should be ready to keep these subjects in line and loyal to the unified crown, whether by English or French means."
 english_channel_control: "Channel Control"
 english_channel_control_desc: "The heart of trade for us is quite obvious: the English Channel. It's a haven for trade and very profitable for us, and along with that, it has given us ample opportunity to refine our naval efforts and tactics, as well as giving us a safe gateway to the west and the east. It's our natural duty to ensure that our power propagates out from the English Channel and never fades from it."
 fertility_of_french_land: "Fertility of French Land"
 fertility_of_french_land_desc: "With the extremely fertile lands of France under our control, we can reform the agricultural practices over time and ensure an ample supply of food (as well as other resources) for our people. It might take some time to do, but it will be more than worth it in the end when the military and citizens of the Angevin Realm are well fed and prosperous."
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres: "Interlocked Administrative Cadres"
 inter_lock_administrative_cadres_desc: "With the unification of the crowns comes administrative questions and some are tougher to handle than others, but we are not without the will to overcome these obstacles. Cultivating a unified court between both the English and French will help us achieve this goal of an integrated and well connected administration, one that can manage the vast domains of the Angevin Realm."
 industrialization_measures: "Industrialization Measures"
 industrialization_measures_desc: "A new age is coming about, an age of new technologies and ideas that the people of the Angevin Realm are seeing as both dangerous and full of potential. It may be foolish of us to rush into this new age, but the benefits of its industrial techniques and new technologies are simply too good to pass up. Whatever problems come with entering this new age we will deal with, but industrial matters must become a central part of the Angevin Realm."
