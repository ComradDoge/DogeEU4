 ser_roman_alliance_title:0 "Restore the Old Alliance"
 ser_roman_alliance_desc:0 "With enemies on all sides, we must look for allies wherever we can. While our alliance with the Byzantines failed us before, if they are willing to support us once again, we should not pass on the opportunity."
 ser_recover_from_the_war_title:0 "Recover from the War"

 ser_conquer_macedonia_title:0 "Conquer Macedonia"
 ser_conquer_macedonia_desc:0 "To our south the ancient lands of Macedonia lie within our grasp, and we should seize the moment and take it. Wealthy in their own right, they also prove strategically invaluable as a springboard for the conquest of the rest of Greece."
 ser_skanderbegs_homeland_title:0 "Skanderbeg's Homeland"
 ser_skanderbegs_homeland_desc:0 "The rugged lands of Albania are crucial to securing our western flank, and are home to some of the most formidable mercenaries of Europe. Perhaps if we take their lands they might be "convinced" to join us."
 ser_secure_greece_title:0 "Secure Greece"
 ser_secure_greece_desc:0 "As the rightful defenders of both the Romans and all Orthodox Christians, protecting the Greeks from Latin and other foreign barbarians should be our top priority. If we can formalise a union between our two peoples, nothing can stand against us."
 ser_reclaim_belgrade_title:0 "Reclaim Belgrade"
 ser_reclaim_belgrade_desc:0 "Belgrade, the ancient and rightful capital of the Serbs lies beyond our grasp. We must liberate this great city if we are to restore Serbia to her rightful place in the Balkans."

 ser_dalmatian_trading_cities_desc:0 "The coastal Dalmatian cities have long been beyond the control of any major Slavic state, no matter how powerful. Now this changes, if we wish to extend our influence into the rich Adriatic, these cities must fall."
 ser_dissolve_bulgaria_title:0 "Dissolve Bulgaria"
 ser_dissolve_bulgaria_desc:0 "The Balkans have been persistently terrorised by the Bulgar menace. Even now, they stand in our way of becoming the true successor to the Romans. Furthermore, we believe that Bulgaria must be destroyed!"
 ser_turn_against_the_romans_title:0 "Turn Against the Romans"
 ser_turn_against_the_romans_desc:0 "Whilst Byzantine support has been useful to us in the past, it is clear that they are far too weak and divided to properly maintain the legacy of the Romans. The city of world's desire is within our grasp, and with it, our ascension will be secured."
 ser_legacy_of_the_sclavinians_title:0 "Legacy of the Sclavinians"
 ser_legacy_of_the_sclavinians_desc:0 "With Constantinople and the Balkans under our control, the time has come for us to truly take the mantle of "Roman". Let our country integrate with the Greeks that we rule and reforge a powerful new Roman empire."

 ser_secure_bosnia_desc:0 "Our religious brethren, the Bosnians to our west, suffer under the rule of the Croats. We must reunify their lands under our own banner, and gain a good buffer against future Catholic aggression."

 ser_carpathian_hegemony_title:0 "Carpathian Hegemony"

 ser_triumph_egypt_title:0 "Triumph for Egypt"
 ser_triumph_egypt_desc:0 "Egypt. It is a land of gold and trade; An ancient expanse of culture, and a land ripe for our conquest. Egypt is vital to secure our trade routes throughout the Mediterranean, and the lands have become famous with the Byzantine mantle since they were incorporated into the Roman Empire long ago. To elevate the Sclavinian name, these lands must be secured!"
 ser_triumph_levant_title:0 "Triumph for the Levant"
 ser_triumph_levant_desc:0 "As Sclavinians, it is vital that we turn our eyes to the Levant.

 ser_triumph_anatolia_title:0 "Triumph for Anatolia"
 ser_triumph_anatolia_desc:0 "Not much needs to be said about the lands of Anatolia to stress their importance. If we are truly to succeed the Byzantines, these lands must be ours. Their historical mantle is too important, and their lands too valuable to be left to the hands of foreigners."

 ser_serbian_hussars_desc:0 "Cavalry is of utmost importance if we are to continue our expansion. As our armies grow, their shock and flanking abilities will be crucial to our success in both offence and defence. Let us grow these ranks and bolster the Serbian armies for our future endeavours."

 ser_hajduks_desc:0 "As we continue to fight wars, we must build our armies to meet our foes. For this reason, we should continue past simple hussars and build a grand army.

 ser_order_of_the_dragon_desc:0 "Our armies continue to flourish in both quality and quantity, continually growing along with our glorious state. There is one crucial step we must take as we spread throughout the Balkans, though. If we ally ourselves more strongly with the nobility, we will be able to take advantage of the famous 'Order of the Dragon'. This order of the aristocracy can bolster our armies both in quality and towards conquest, aiding us in fighting the enemies of the Christian faith."
 ser_cities_title:0 "Cities of Serbia"
 ser_cities_desc:0 "After developing the countryside, it is time to focus on our glorious cities. These urban areas are the key to centres of trade, commerce, and innovation. While the rural areas can only get us so far, we can build up these cities to further grow the Serbian economy and secure for ourselves a rich future."
 ser_mining_code_title:0 "Reissue the Mining Code"

 ser_develop_countryside_desc:0 "The lands of Serbia have fallen into poor disarray as of late, while we have tried to fend off our enemies from all sides.

 ser_manufactories_title:0 "Industrial Expansion"
 ser_manufactories_desc:0 "The age of Industrialization is coming. That much is true.

 ser_danubian_trade_power_title:0 "Danubian Trade Power"

 ser_land_in_italy_title:0 "Land in Italy"
 ser_land_in_italy_desc:0 "Italy is a land that does not necessarily stretch outside the reach of the Balkans. Additionally, the region is oppressed by the Muslim rulers of Sicily. If we were to land in Italy, we could push out these heathens, take the rich land for ourselves, and steward the lost souls there back towards the one true faith."
 ser_banish_title:0 "Banish the Heathen"
 ser_banish_desc:0 "Now established on the Italian Peninsula, we must drive out the Muslim heathens as soon as possible! They oppress the peoples there, and we can not allow their religion to have a foothold to spread to the rest of Europe. It is time to drive them out, once and for all."
 ser_pentarchy_title:0 "Restore the Pentarchy"
 ser_pentarchy_desc:0 "Justinian’s Pentarchy has been defiled by the organisation of Catholicism throughout Europe. How can we stand as a disunited church when we, as people, are united in Christ? We must reconcile the central cities of Justinian’s system and restore the Pentarchy to the modern era."
 ser_heal_schism_title:0 "Mend the Schism"
 ser_heal_schism_desc:0 "Too long has our faith stood disunited. We have been divided by petty issues and variances that have driven us apart, not together. We need to mend this schism that has pained us. We can no longer identify as Orthodox or Catholic. Under Christianity, we are only one thing: Followers of Jesus Christ."

 ab_serbia.1.t:0 "Legacy of the Sclavinians"
 ab_serbia.1.d:0 "The Sclavinians, our early ancestors, were an honourable and free people corrupted by the decadence of the East. Forced to adapt to a society that wasn’t theirs, the Grecians and the Bulgars tried to break our spirit, deluding themselves that we would stay down forever. Since our rebellion and return to form, the Serbian voivodeship has strived to bring itself closer to the ancient standards, uniting our cousins under the new banner. After many years of struggle and turmoil, peace and unity have returned to Sclavinia."
 ab_serbia.1.a:0 "Today, Sclavinia; tomorrow, all Slavs!"
 #Croatia
 cro_retaliation_title:0 "Croatian Retaliation"
 cro_retaliation_desc:0 "Dark clouds amass on the horizon. Enemies leer hungrily at our lands. All around us, they stand in wait - the ambitious Bulgars, the greedy Venetians, the ravenous Magyars. If these conquerors do not devour us, then another power surely will. We must not lay down and die here - Croatia must retaliate, take back what is hers!"
 cro_braslavs_legacy_title:0 "Braslav's Legacy"
 cro_braslavs_legacy_desc:0 "The legendary Prince Braslav once dared to dominate Pannonia and even Serbia. However, the treachery of the roaming Magyar horde and the weakness of his successors proved too much for our fledgling realm. Pannonia was lost - but now, centuries later, it stands vacant and idle once more, vulnerable to our advances. Now is our chance to reclaim Braslav's honour!"
 cro_blatnograd_title:0 "The City of Blatnograd"
 cro_blatnograd_desc:0 "Pannonia is a fertile and beautiful land - one cannot deny that. It proves flat, hospitable and a stepping stone for trade deeper into Europe. One also cannot deny, however, the devastation that has befallen the area as a result of repeated conquests and the toil of warfare. We must prove to its inhabitants that we are wiser and more beneficial overlords than the Magyars - Blatnograd must stand tall!"
 cro_cross_the_danube_title:0 "Cross the Danube"
 cro_cross_the_danube_desc:0 "The ruinous Magyars have lived for far too long! From across the Carpathians, the murderous marauders leapt, razing and pillaging everything in their path. Never have they moved on, however - always slipping through the fingers of greater powers, persisting despite God's grace. Perhaps we have a duty to put an end to their existence?"
 cro_pacta_title:0 "Pacta Conventa"
 cro_pacta_desc:0 "Carpathia is a land with clear boundaries. Sprawling, ancient rivers, immovable, frosty mountains and boundless farmlands - a country ripe for the taking. Yet for centuries now, petty powers have squabbled and wrestled over innocent Carpathia's carcass. Should this cycle not come to an end? Should the banner of great Croatia not ripple high in the Carpathian sky? Should the cross not reign here forevermore?"
 cro_control_dubrovnik_title:0 "Control Dubrovnik"
 cro_control_dubrovnik_desc:0 "A most foul testament to Venetian ambition stands just south of our holdings - Dubrovnik, controlled and dictated by the Ragusan mob. With Dalmatia back under our control, it is only fitting we tidy up the rest of the Italian mess splattered across our coastline."
 cro_recover_dalmatia_title:0 "Recover Dalmatia"
 cro_recover_dalmatia_desc:0 "The vile Venetians have exhausted our patience. Again and again, the wily merchants of the so-called 'serene republic' have encroached upon the Balkans - disguising their greed in virtuous noise, laying waste to innocent seaside towns with mercenary rabble. Dalmatia is rightful Croatian land - let it be known!"
 cro_annihilate_venice_title:0 "Annihilate Venice"
 cro_annihilate_venice_desc:0 "We cannot allow the serene republic to exist as a functional entity. For as long as Venetian traders roam the Mediterranean, the Balkans will never be safe from their grubby fingers. Their beloved city and bountiful core lay within our grasp - let us squeeze and never let go!"
 cro_unite_with_the_slovenes_title:0 "Unite with the Slovenes"
 cro_unite_with_the_slovenes_desc:0 "The Slovenes, a people not much different from our own, stand vulnerable before the gates of the Holy Roman Empire. They would benefit better beneath our banners instead of foolhardy and naive self-determination - lest they be gobbled up by the Germans, or worse, Venice."
 cro_conquer_serbia_title:0 "Conquer Serbia"
 cro_conquer_serbia_desc:0 "Years ago, we were promised Serbian lands - but a sliver we were granted. Our appetite stands unsated - God knows we deserve more. For truly, the lands of the Serbians are ruled by heretical rabble, adhering to the tired and weary churches of the east. Let us sweep up the dust that is Orthodoxy - and do away with the silly idea of a Serbian state, independent."
 cro_clash_with_bulgars_title:0 "Clash with Bulgars"
 cro_clash_with_bulgars_desc:0 "The Bulgars, boastful and ambitious, see themselves as the undisputed hegemon of the Balkans - successors to the Romans, safeguards against the distant Turkish menace. This attitude is foolish - and must be amended, by force, if Croatia wishes to exist as an independent and powerful entity."  
 cro_south_slavic_union_title:0 "South Slavic Union"
 cro_south_slavic_union_desc:0 "At last, a new dawn's light eases its way across the Balkans. The southern Slavs see peace beneath a united banner - ours. It is only fitting that we now become bolder in our ambitions - proclaim ourselves a hegemon and uniter of all the Slavs of the Balkans and heirs apparent to the ancestral peoples, the Illyrians."
 cro_slavicize_the_italians_title:0 "Slavicize the Italians"
 cro_slavicize_the_italians_desc:0 "Italy stands ripe for the picking. Having negated the Venetian menace, the cities, rivers, and coastlines of the vast and ancient peninsula await us, beckoning. To our surprise, we find our eager populace yearning for new horizons, opportunities, and beginnings - in the form of new land. Perhaps we could settle them in our new Italian holdings."
 cro_italian_invasion_title:0 "Italian Invasion"
 cro_italian_invasion_desc:0 "For as long as any powers not of our own exist in Italy, we will be threatened by their proximity. We have proven to ourselves and the world our claim to the Venetian lands - why not extend our reach and claim the rest? A more peaceful Mediterranean awaits... a more Croatian Mediterranean, too."
 cro_adriatic_empire_title:0 "Adriatic Empire"
 cro_adriatic_empire_desc:0 "This sea is ours. Do you not feel it? Do you not feel the longing as you gaze upon the sombre waves of the Adriatic? Do you not feel the pride as you hear Croatian songs and fanfare throughout streets once Dalmatian, halls once Ragusan? Do you not feel mild amusement as you see a tattered Venetian banner rotting in the passing waves? We certainly do, at least - so we feel it is only fitting that we are the Adriatic's sole power."
 cro_zvonimirs_seat_title:0 "Knin, the Seat of Zvonimir"
 cro_zvonimirs_seat_desc:0 "Knin's storied walls have borne witness to the rise and fall of kings; its restoration as the heart of Croatian kingship is overdue. Reviving its fortresses and palaces will honour King Zvonimir's legacy and signify national rejuvenation. By renewing its cultural and administrative significance, Knin can become a beacon of Croatian identity and statehood, where history and progress intertwine."
 cro_slavonian_breadbasket_title:0 "Breadbasket of Slavonia"
 cro_slavonian_breadbasket_desc:0 "The rich soils of Slavonia have fed our nation for centuries, yet they hold untapped potential. Modernising agricultural practices and irrigation systems can transform this region into a model of efficiency and abundance. By focusing on crop diversity and sustainable practices, Slavonia can become Croatia's breadbasket and a leader in European agriculture, bolstering our food security and economic independence."
 cro_revitalize_the_economy_title:0 "Revitalise the Economy"
 cro_revitalize_the_economy_desc:0 "Croatia's economy, rich in potential, stands at a pivotal moment. Strategic investments in infrastructure, technology, and education can spur a new era of growth and innovation. By encouraging business and entrepreneurship we can attract foreign investment, boost exports, and enhance our global competitiveness. This economic revitalization will lay the groundwork for a prosperous future, creating opportunities for all Croatians."
 cro_industrialize_croatia_title:0 "Industrialize Croatia"
 cro_industrialize_croatia_desc:0 "The Industrial Revolution offers an unprecedented opportunity for national transformation. Prioritising sectors such as shipbuilding, textiles, and manufacturing, and supporting them with infrastructure and innovation can propel Croatia into the forefront of industrial nations. This journey towards Industrialization must also be sustainable, balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. By harnessing our human and natural resources, we can build a resilient, dynamic, and inclusive economy."
 cro_croatian_government_title:0 "Strengthen the Sabor"
 cro_croatian_government_desc:0 "The Sabor, our historic assembly, is the cornerstone of Croatian democracy. Enhancing its authority and efficacy will ensure that our policies reflect the voices of our nation. Strengthening this institution involves legislative reform but fostering a culture of robust debate and public engagement. An empowered Sabor will be pivotal in guiding Croatia through the challenges of the modern world, ensuring that our governance is responsive and responsible."
 cro_naval_powerhouse_title:0 "Naval Powerhouse"
 cro_naval_powerhouse_desc:0 "As a nation cradled by the Adriatic, Croatia's destiny is intertwined with the mastery of the seas. Establishing ourselves as a naval powerhouse involves more than expanding our fleet; it requires integrating advanced naval technology, comprehensive training programs, and strategic maritime bases. This endeavour will reinforce our defences and enable us to influence the political and economic dynamics of the Mediterranean. A formidable presence on the waves will solidify our status as a key regional player and guardian of crucial sea lanes."
 cro_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Build a Merchant Fleet"
 cro_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "A thriving merchant fleet is the lifeblood of a prosperous nation. By constructing a versatile and robust fleet, we can tap into the lucrative trade routes that crisscross the Adriatic and beyond. This initiative will involve incentivizing shipbuilding, nurturing maritime trade relations, and establishing Croatia as a hub of commerce. As our merchant ships traverse the globe, they will not only bring wealth to our shores but also carry the influence and culture of Croatia to distant lands."
 cro_trading_cities_title:0 "Expand the Trading Cities"
 cro_trading_cities_desc:0 "Croatia's historic trading cities - bustling hives of commerce and culture - are the engines of our economic growth. Expanding and modernising cities like Dubrovnik, Split, and Rijeka will catapult them into prominence as centres of trade, tourism, and innovation. Investments in infrastructure, beautification, and cultural heritage projects will enhance their economic potential and allure as global destinations. As these cities flourish, they will serve as beacons of Croatian enterprise and ingenuity, drawing merchants, artists, and diplomats from all corners of the world."
 cro_vinodol_code_title:0 "Revise the Vinodol Code"
 cro_vinodol_code_desc:0 "The Vinodol Code, a cornerstone of Croatian medieval law, has guided our legal principles for centuries. To adapt to the evolving needs of our society, it is imperative to revise this ancient code. This revision process should modernise our legal system while preserving the essence of the traditional laws that have shaped our nation. By balancing historical wisdom with contemporary justice, we can ensure that our legal framework is fair, progressive, and reflective of our national identity."
 cro_naval_capacity_title:0 "Boost the Naval Capacity"

 #string_start_title_croatia:0 "The Kingdom of Croatia"
 #string_start_croatia:0 "Croatia has been an independent state since the 8th century, but its history is one of constant struggles for survival. In the 9th Century, Prince §YBraslav§! would briefly extend dominion far into Serbia and Pannonia, only for the §YMagyars§! to arrive in Pannonia, killing the Prince and with him Croatia's first chance of hegemony. Things only got worse from there: Braslav's weak successors faced invasion from Italy, and soon civil wars racked the country, and the Croatian state dissolved. After twenty years of anarchy, two pagan brothers, §YTomislav§! and §YTrpimir§!, would reunite the country, but soon the pair would formally convert to §YCatholic Christianity§!, trading their faith for a Papal crown, with Tomislav as the first King of Croatia. Under his successors the state was prosperous and stable, enjoying a century of peace. But in 1091 the §YVenetians§! would shatter this prosperity, invading Croatia with the pretext of supporting a candidate for the succession of the heirless §YStephen II§!. Instead, the Venetians would seize nearly the whole coastline, and the next decade would see bitter fighting between the two sides. Just as the Croatians were pushing into the North of Italy, the last Trpimirovic king died, plunging Croatia back into civil war.\n\nThe country would stabilise after the death of §YPeter I Snacic§!, with his nephew Ban §YKresimir Draskovic of Bosnia§! taking the throne in 1125, ending the civil strife within the country. Kresimir V would attempt to expand Croatia by force, invading Serbia and Pannonia like his distant predecessor Braslav, but his armies were routed in the §YBattle of Nis§! in 1141, only to be completely wiped out in Belgrade two years later, taking the King's life. The next century and a half saw occasional skirmishes with the Pannonians, Magyars, and Serbs, but little would change. This delicate balance was upset in the early 15th century: the §YByzantines§! in their hubris had attacked the Bulgarians, and the Tsar had promised King Mutimir Serbian lands for assistance. Mutimir I duly invaded Serbia, and as his prize took Belgrade, humiliating the Serbs. But Mutimir's reign also saw Venetian encroachment further into Croatia, and soon the stronghold of Split was under Venetian dominion.\n\nWith Croatia's gains in Serbia uncertain and their coastal cities under Venetian yoke, Croatia in the 15th century is a state in a perilous position. The Bulgarians seem set on subjugating the whole peninsula, Croatia included. The Serbs, bitter about their losses, are hell-bent on revenging themselves on their enemies. The Venetians, at the peak of their power, now see the valuable Croatian markets and look inland hungrily, a dagger pointed at Croatia's back ready to strike. And with the Magyar tribes stirring, even the Pannonians seek an end to their long slumber. With enemies abounding and friends few and far between, Balkan hegemony is still a distant dream, and yet §YMutimir II§! sees Italy on the other side of the Adriatic shining, a beautiful prize open for the taking. The question remains; shall Croatia be subsumed, or will it yet see all that and more?"
 #string_start_title_serbia:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
 #string_start_serbia:0 "Originating from a union of Serbian principalities and swearing fealty to the Byzantine Emperor, the Kingdom of Serbia has over the last century existed as the frontier of Orthodoxy against the pagan Magyars of the North and the Catholic Croats to the West. Among the Serbian principalities to First break away from the Byzantine Emperor was the principality of Duklja. In 1071 Mihalo of Duklja provided aid to the uprising of Grigori Volteh against the Byzantines Under the agreement to have his son Bodin crowned as Tsar of Bulgaria yet this involvement would prove for naught. However, the Byzantine Empire would be wracked by the Seljuk invasion of Anatolia and did little more than take hostages and demand the Serbs allegiance.\n\nThe Principality of Duklja’s hegemony over the Serbs would be fleeting. Conflicts between Mihalo's sons and his brothers would see the various principalities divided and put under the influence of other powers such as the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia, Venice, Byzantium, and the Bulgarians. The Principaliities of Dulkja and Travuna would fall under the sway of the Byzantines, the Princpality of Zachulmia to the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia, and would set up a Principality of Srijem centered around the city of Belgrade. Lastly, the Princes of Raska were supported by the Bulgarians.\n\nIt would be the Princes of Raska who would form the Kingdom of Serbia under the House of Nemanja, descendants of one of the brothers of Mihalo of Dulkja. In the 1280’s Raska under the reign of Stephan-Mihailo would herald a period of consolidation of other Serbian principalities as well as take advantage of a then-ailing Bulgaria to gain more land. In 1296, Stephan-Mihailo had managed to secure areas around the Great Morava River against a rival claimant of the house of Asen. In 1304 Stephan’s son Ivan defeated the principalities of Srijem and Zachumia even moving the capital to Belgrade, and by 1338, the principalities of Dulkja and Travuna were finally brought under the rule of Raska. The year 1339 would see a proclamation of Ivan II as King of the Serbs, and an unspoken challenge to them remaining a Bulgarian protectorate.\n\nThe newfound kingdom would find itself tested. Wearily watched by both its western neighbor Croatia and a now recovered Bulgaria looking to reclaim the lands seized by Stephan-Mihailo. The next seven decades would see small conflicts break out with Croatia and Bulgarian skirmishes punctuated by periods of uneasy peace and Magayr raids from the north. In 1410 however, this would change when Serbia found itself in a war with both the Croats and Bulgarians while not catastrophic saw it shorn of Belgrade and its eastern border with Bulgaria. A now weakened Serbia has found itself with few allies to turn, and the one strong enough to help them is the just as threatened Byzantine Empire. Will Serbia retake its lands or is it doomed to be subjugated by the Bulgarians yet again?"
