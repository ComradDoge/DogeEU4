The paintings and objects were mainly exhibited in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua, configuring itself as a real museum within the museum. \nFerdinando Gonzaga, returning from Rome in 1612 on the occasion of his appointment as sixth Duke of Mantua, found in the palaces very rich artistic endowments, which required a work of cataloging. He personally took care of the reorganization, cataloging and placement of art objects. The family could boast the most important museum in Europe, with 20,000 precious objects and 1,800 paintings by the most prestigious artists."

 mantua_knightly_orders_reform: "Knightly Orders"

 lombardy_venetia_reform_desc: "The constitution of an union of the proudest people in northern Italy was but a start of the creation of a superpower in Northern Italy able to rival the houses of the Dolphins and the Imperial Eagles. March forth my brave brothers, il Moscato Piemontese ed il Pesto Genovese will be in our hands when we will dine in the vast plains of the Emilia tomorrow."

 #Constitutional Republics
 constitutional_republic_reform: "Constitutional Republic"
 constitutional_republic_reform_desc: "With ideals of true rule by the people and reviving true republicanism spreading across the Christian world, it is no longer sufficient that we be ruled by only a select few families claiming a birthright, or by the merchant class alone hijacking the state for their own needs. A Constitutional Republic serves to protect the rights and representation of all the people while still maintaining the rule of law."

 republican_virtues_reform: "Republican Virtues"
 republican_virtues_reform_desc: "The government itself is based on the rights of the individual, and as such our Constitutional Republic merely serves to enshrine and protect these rights rather than claiming to give the people what they already have endowed by their Creator. The freedoms of voting, speech, and other rights not listed, shall not be infringed by a government based on those rights."

 federalism_reform: "Federalism"
 federalism_reform_desc: "Only by devolving certain powers over domestic affairs to the various states and provinces can we ensure that our republic is secure against becoming a tyrannical monarchy, and the various local interests of individuals be represented.

 judicial_review_reform: "Judicial Review"
 judicial_review_reform_desc: "The power of those most familiar with our foundational Constitution and laws must be given some power to reign in actions of the other branches of government that cross the line of going against that constitution."

 imperial_executive_branch_power_reform: "Imperial Executive Branch"
 imperial_executive_branch_power_reform_desc: "As our nation grows ever beyond the boundaries and population envisioned by its founders, it has become more and more necessary that a singular head of state make quick and decisive decisions using his or her own bureaucracy, rather than wait for the slow and cumbersome legislative and judicial branches for every single issue."

 federal_governorship_reform: "Federal Governorship"
 federal_governorship_reform_desc: "Our republic is now much too large to be ruled as much by a centralized government as it was before, and each state also has too many people to be governed efficiently the way it was before. The individual state governors must now take more responsibility to maintain order."

 amendable_constitution_reform: "Amendable Constitution"
