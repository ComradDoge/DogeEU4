 TUN_subdue_zayyanids_title: "Break the Zayyanids"
 TUN_subdue_zayyanids_desc: "The Zayyanids of Tlemcen are easily the weakest of the major Maghrebi states. Between the Hammer and the Anvil, we must strike them and subdue them before the Moroccans get a chance to do so. We cannot spare any time, as they might regain control over their territories outside capital."
 TUN_tafilalt_title: "Conquer Tafilalt"
 TUN_tafilalt_desc: "The territories once held by Tlemcen are now being integrated into our country. With that underway, we may now lead a strike into the Moroccan peripheries, territories that are on the trans-saharan trade routes south."
 TUN_kabyle_berbers_title: "Kabyle Berbers"
 TUN_kabyle_berbers_desc: "The western highlands of Kabylia are home to a small, yet important minority in our country, the Kabyle Berbers. Though seemingly insignificant on a larger scale, when uppity, they may wield significant political power and resist the control of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We must seek to build up our relations with the Kabylians, as their loyalty might greatly benefit us in times of need."
 TUN_fez_title: "Conquer Fez"
 TUN_fez_desc: "Let us strike the heart of Marinid Morocco - Fez. A glamorous capital city, it is the single most powerful entity on this scale in all of West Maghrib. Conquest of the area essentially spells subjugation for the entire region."

 TUN_cordoba_desc: "The only rightful rulers of Iberia are the Cordoban muslims! Let us lead a series of conquests into the south of the peninsula with the goal of restoring vassal Cordoba as the final goal."
 TUN_pious_ruler_title: "A Pious Sultan"
 TUN_pious_ruler_desc: "The Hafsids are claimants to the Caliphate, a title that not anyone can just lay a claim to. It is natural then, that the Hafsid [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s must be the embodiments of muslim piety and fervor. Should they fail to fulfill their duties, their decadence shall lead to their end."
 TUN_claimed_caliphate_title: "The Claimed Caliphate"
 TUN_claimed_caliphate_desc: "Back during the days of the Caliphate in the west and the Caliphate in the east, there stood the Hafid Sultanate, holding onto the lands of Ifriqiya. It is in this spirit, that Muhammad I al-Mustansir has claimed the title of Caliph in 1249, which we've held since then."
 TUN_a_title_respected_title: "A Title Respected"
 TUN_a_title_respected_desc: "We are one of the few claimants to the title of Caliphate, however our claim is far from respected. We must provide a show of force and change the tides of power in the Muslim world, enforcing our superiority."
 TUN_reform_our_forces_title: "Reform our Forces"
 TUN_reform_our_forces_desc: "The recent ascension of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the throne has left many enemies a chance to make their moves, which they, obviously, did. Let us counter that by building up our army."

 TUN_sultanate_of_ifriqiya_title: "Sultanate of Ifriqiya"
 TUN_sultanate_of_ifriqiya_desc: "Our borders once again extend from Morocco to Tripolitania. We are most certainly worthy of calling ourselves the Sultanate, or Caliphate, of Ifriqiyya."

 TUN_madrasah_desc: "Madrasahs are muslim institutions that serve towards education of the ulema. They are usually built adjacent to Mosques and are founding them serves as an essential to the legacy of a Muslim Ruler."
 TUN_caravans_south_title: "Caravans South"
 TUN_caravans_south_desc: "As the Christian kingdoms refuse to trade with us while our eastern partners are fighting petty squables, it is apparent that our ports are seeing less attention than ever. We must therefore foster the trade with the only major active trade route that we have - the transsaharan trade. Under our patronage, the camel caravans shall flock to the oases across the Tuat route." 
 TUN_centralized_administration_title: "Centralized Rule"
 TUN_centralized_administration_desc: "The [Root.GetAdjective] administration is weak and frail. Any and all actions must be taken that would further our authority and control over the realm. Without that, the future of the [Root.Government.GetName] is looking grim."
 TUN_loyal_cities_title: "Loyal Cities"
 TUN_loyal_cities_desc: "As it currently stands, the Hafsid crown is struggling with centralization of rule. The cities have essentially free reign, which causes a considerable loss of revenue. As such, the time is come to rein them in, be it by showing [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] authority, or by appeasing them to get them on our side."
 TUN_dyes_of_kano_title: "Indigo of Kano"

 TUN_spanish_frontier_desc: "The wicked kingdoms of Iberia have, in the span of a few centuries, repulsed and eliminated all traces of Andalusian rule.

 TUN_foreign_quarters_in_tunis_title: "Foreign Quarters"
 TUN_foreign_quarters_in_tunis_desc: "Despite the rampant piracy in the city-ports of the Maghreb, the Sultans of Tunis stay keen to the idea of enabling trade relations with the Mercantile Republics. The most recent of such trade agreements were the ones conducted by Abu 'Amr 'Uthman in 1438 and 1444. Should we strive to go further, we may be able to deliver on giving the italian merchants living quarters in Tunis."
 TUN_trade_title: "Trade in Tunis"
 TUN_trade_desc: "Though more famous for taking part in the Barbary piracy, it would be a mistake to base our views of the Hafsid State by looking through the lens of pirate history. While the piracy was very much present, the Tunisian Sultans also tried to harbor traders and diplomats."
 TUN_harbor_title: "Tunisian Harbor"
 TUN_harbor_desc: "Our capital harbor is in dire need of expansion. If our dreams of ruling the Maghreb and, in extension, the Western Mediterranean, the [341.GetAdjective] harbor must be able to accomodate a more substantial amount of ships."
 TUN_raid_christian_shipping_title: "Raid Shipping"
 TUN_raid_christian_shipping_desc: "The Christian shipping and trade tends to be conducted between the Iberians, Italian Mainland and the Italian outposts in the east. The Tunisian harbors seem to be omitted! As such, we must teach them a lesson and have them pay for their treachery."
 TUN_sardinia_title: "Conquer Sardinia"

 TUN_baleares_title: "Strategic Archipelago"
 TUN_baleares_desc: "The eastern coast of Iberia is home to wealthy trading cities, rich in bustling markets full of Merchants from all over the Mediterranean. We need not disrupt these trade routes by conquest, all we need to do is to establish a naval base in the Balearic Islands, allowing us to conduct regular raids on the coastal cities and to seize the wealth of the ships passing in between the islands."
 TUN_spain_title: "Defeat the Iberians"
 TUN_spain_desc: "The Iberian kingdoms have suffered a great defeat at the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty]. We cannot let this momentum halt and that is why, henceforth, our push shall be fiercer than ever!"

 TUN_agriculture_desc: "While many believe North Africa to be an arid wasteland deprived of any agricultural wealth, the truth could not be any further.

 TUN_abdaliyya_title: "Abdaliyya Library"
 TUN_abdaliyya_desc: "Ordered by the Sultan Abu Abdallah around 1500, the establishment of the Abdaliyya library within the Al-Zaytuna Mosque has allowed the religious and academic studies of the Hafsid sultanate to flourish, housing great works of all kinds of subjects and sciences - including grammar, logic, documentations, etiquette of research, cosmology, arithmetic, geometry and studies of minerals."
 TUN_wooden_wall_title: "Protect the Barbary Coast"

 TUN_navy_title: "Grow our Navy"
 TUN_navy_desc: "Surrounded by waters, our coastal cities are prone to naval blockades, giving our foes an opportunity to cut a major source of our income through the use of ships. There is a way to prevent that though, for simply growing our navy would be enough to fix this vulnerability."
 TUN_sicily_title: "Muslim Sicily"
 TUN_sicily_desc: "But a half millenium ago, Sicily used to be owned by Muslim dynasties. First it was the Aghlabids, then it was owned by the Fatimids, and afterwards it succumbed to Christian invasion. While it never saw Hafsid rule, it having been muslim is enough of a reason to restore it to our domain."
 TUN_east_title: "Eastern Islands"
 TUN_east_desc: "Much of what is the Eastern Mediterranean Islands could be considered colonies of the Venetians or the Genoese. Those who would not fall under this category would certainly have been influenced as such. While the Italian republics are respectable trade partners, we should aim to limit their influence in the east, if possible."
 TUN_zituna_madrasah_title: "Al-Zaytuna Mosque"
 TUN_zituna_madrasah_desc: "The Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the oldest mosque in the region of Tunis.

 TUN_fezzan_title: "Subdue the Tribes"
 TUN_fezzan_desc: "Fezzan is a land of dry river valleys and oases. In these harsh environments, ancient civilizations thrive in one of the more isolated communities in northern Maghreb. With such isolation, their loyalty is questionable at best, and so we must strive to take stricter control of the provinces."
 TUN_west_africa_islam_title: "Spread Islam"
 TUN_west_africa_islam_desc: "While our beliefs have indeed spread beyond the harsh Sahara, the religiousness of those who have converted is dubious at best. Action must be taken against weak religiousness and the unbelievers in general, and it appears to be that we are the closest response."
 TUN_malta_title: "Fort of Malta"
 TUN_malta_desc: "The fort in Malta is one powerful Christian Fortress. A stronghold for crusaders, it can be used regularly to raid our northern fertile valleys, terrorizing local population and putting our operations at stake. It is time to expel them from the islands!"
 TUN_kairwan_mosque_title: "Kairouan Mosque"
 TUN_kairwan_mosque_desc: "The Great Mosque of Kairouan is one of the largest Islamic constructions in North Africa. Built during the founding of the city of Kairouan in 670, it is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world.

 TUN_egypt_title: "The Nile Delta"
 TUN_egypt_desc: "Having solidified our hold over Tripolitania and the Fezzani oases, the time is come to consider an expansion outward, along the shores of Mediterranean.

 ME_Tunis_Events.1.t: "Abu 'Amr 'Uthman - Last Drop of Hafsid Glory"
 ME_Tunis_Events.1.d: "Born in the month of Ramadan of the year 1419, Abu ‘Amr ‘Uthman was	the last of the Hafsid rulers who would bring prosperity to the Hafsid Sultanate. First appointed as governor of Constantine in 1434 by his brother, al-Muntasir, he would soon ascend to the throne with the regnal title “al-Mutawakkil 'ala Allah” or ‘he who relies on God’, not a year later after al-Muntasir’s untimely death. Uthman’s early reign was plagued with insurgencies led by his relatives, of which it took until 1452 before the rebellions were finally quashed.\n\nHeralded as tall, thoughtful, just and pious, Abu ‘Amr ‘Uthman was both a capable military leader and successful diplomat, leading campaigns in the Maghrebi interior against autonomous towns, centralising their control to the sultanate. Later military campaigns against Tripolitania, Ouargla, the shifting loyalties of the Berber tribes, and the disloyal rulers of the vassal kingdom of Tlemcen would solidify ‘Uthman's military prowess and sovereignty over North Africa. On the other hand, he would be able to keep remarkably amicable relations with many of the other powers within the Mediterranean, forging relationships with the kingdom of Aragon, the mercantile states of Italy, the Ottomans and the Mamluks.\n\nAs a pious Muslim, he would establish many waqf foundations and zawiya institutes, in addition to building many hydraulic works for the city of Tunis. Overall, the reign of ‘Uthman was one of stability, peace and military and diplomatic success. After the death and end of reign of ‘Uthman in 1489, the Hafsid Sultanate would never see such a ruler again. \nTruly, Abu ‘Amr ‘Uthman was the last drop of Hafsid glory."
 ME_Tunis_Events.1.a: "Forward!"
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.2.t: "The Oran Fatwa"
 ME_Tunis_Events.2.d: "Following the successive defeats of the Islamic world in Iberia, the threat to our way of life in the Iberian peninsula is evident. Our brothers in faith are unable to follow sharia, being forced to either practice in secret, or to convert to Christianity in order to maintain their livelihoods. If we do not do anything now, the last vestiges of Islam in Iberian will fall, and Islam may be lost to Iberia forever.\n\nThe sharia should be amended for this crisis, and we should allow our brothers in faith to forgo practices that would hide their faith from the inquisitorial Catholics. We need to push the Catholics back, and free our brothers in faith from persecution!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.2.a: "Great News!"
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.3.t: "Hidden."
 ME_Tunis_Events.3.d: "Yep, I am hidden!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.3.a: "That's right!"
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.4.t: "Abu-l-Hasan's Rebellion"
 ME_Tunis_Events.4.d: "Abu-l-Hasan Ali has been a thorn in our side for over a decade even prior to the Shattering, ever since the ascension of his nephew, Sultan ‘Uthman. His delusions of legitimacy, which have increased, over the throne have hampered the peace and stability of the sultanate, and we must deal with him before he can deal any more damage to the prestige of the Hafsid dynasty. He has already reached the walls of our great capital Tunis once before, and even dared to mint currency in his own name. We cannot let this matter drag on, as reports say that the traitorous tribes in Kabylia are now supporting him. We must attack now and crush this pretender once and for all, before they have any more time to prepare!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.4.a: "Strike that fiend at once!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.4.b: "We must bide our time."
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.5.t: "Influences of the Abdaliyya Library"
 ME_Tunis_Events.5.d: "Ordered by the Sultan Abu Abdallah around 1500, the establishment of the Abdaliyya library within the Al-Zaytuna Mosque has allowed the religious and academic studies of the Hafsid sultanate to flourish, housing great works of all kinds of subjects and sciences - including grammar, logic, documentations, etiquette of research, cosmology, arithmetic, geometry and studies of minerals.\n\nOur library of rare manuscripts has drawn attention from great scholars across the lands. Let us take advantage of these visiting scholars to teach our own, and raise our own great scholars!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.5.a: "The finest works of Muslim Scholars shall be found here."
 ME_Tunis_Events.5.b: "Gaze upon the sky!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.5.c: "This will be a catalyst to our engineering projects."
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.6.t: "Madrasah of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 ME_Tunis_Events.6.d: "With the stability of our nation established, and our borders secure, we must now look inward and facilitate growth. If we are to survive as a nation, we must allow ourselves to be enlightened by scholars within and abroad. To do so, we need to establish madrasah for our population. Should we send our own abroad for their studies, or keep them in Tunis?"
 ME_Tunis_Events.6.a: "Yes, fund a Madrasa in [Tunis_capital_Target.GetName]"
 ME_Tunis_Events.6.b: "Send our scholars abroad."
 ME_Tunis_Events.6.c: "We don't need this."
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.7.t: "The Hafsid Caliphate"
 ME_Tunis_Events.7.d: "Our great Hafsid dynasty has made many previous attempts to claim the title of Caliph, being met with scorn and little recognition - the most notable being the Hafsid sultan Muhammad I al-Mustansir first claiming the title of Hafsid Caliph in 1249. Ever since the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258, the new Abbasid Caliph present in Qahirah has been demoted to a simple figurehead in the Mamluk government merely to legitimise their rulers. With the capture of the Abbasid Caliph, we are now in a position to take the title of Caliph for our own, and restore the prestige of the Caliph title.\n\nAfter our show of superiority against the fake Caliph, the rest of the Muslim world can no longer deny our legitimacy and recognise us as the Hafsid Caliphate to protect and guide Islam to another golden age. Already, there are many diplomats from across the Islamic world, visiting us with gifts and seeking guidance from our glorious Caliph. Let us guide our brothers in the faith to enlightenment and prosperity!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.7.a: "Hafsid Caliphate sounds good."
 ME_Tunis_Events.7.b: "It's great to be finally recognized."
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.8.t: "The Remnant of Al-Andalus"
 ME_Tunis_Events.8.d: "As peace has finally been secured in the Maghreb and our sovereignty recognised, we must look to re-establish a stronger presence of Islam in the Iberian peninsula. The original Islamic ruler of Iberia, Al-Andalus, has only recently been relegated to history, its final vestiges vanishing with the collapse of the Emirate of Granada. By re-establishing the Kingdom of Al-Andalus in Quturba, we can easily legitimise our claims in the region against the Christian kingdoms. On the other hand, we could take the lands for ourselves and leave our own mark!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.8.b: "Iberia is ours!"
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.9.t: "Sultanate of Ifriqiya"
 ME_Tunis_Events.9.d: "The first establishment of the province of Ifriqiya was in 703 upon the Umayyad seizure of Africa from the Byzantine Empire. Until now, our hold on the region has been tenuous at best. Now however, as our dominance over the Maghreb has been recognised, streching from the Moroccan coast to the Fezzan corridors, we can once again claim the name of Ifriqiya for ourselves!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.9.a: "Yes, we are Ifriqiyans."
 ME_Tunis_Events.9.b: "No, we would rather be known as [Root.GetName]."
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.11.t: "Conquest of Andalusia"
 ME_Tunis_Events.11.d: "We have done it! The re-establishment of a strong presence of Islam in the Iberian peninsula has been completed, under our military superiority over the weak Christian kingdoms in the region. Our brothers in the faith in Iberia are gathering in our borders, once more free to follow the faith without persecution. Let us finish off the Christians, and let the world know of the glory of Al-Andalus!"
 ME_Tunis_Events.11.a: "Iberia will be ours!"
 
 ME_Tunis_Events.12.t: "Sephardic Jews Arrive in [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Tunis_Events.12.d: "The island of Djerba, the largest island in North Africa, has been home to a large Jewish diaspora, with their oral history claiming to date their first settlement of the island to 586 BC after the fall of the holy city of Jerusalem. Djerba has held an unusually high percentage of Kohanim - the Jewish priestly caste, direct patrilineal descendants of Aaron the first high priest from Mosaic times. Local tradition holds that when Nebuchadnezzar II levelled Solomon's temple and laid waste to Judah and the city of Jerusalem in the year 586, the Kohanim who settled in Djerba were among the refugees who were able to avoid slavery.\n\n Even after the spread of Islam into the Maghreb region, conflicts between our Muslim and Jewish people have been largely absent. News of this peaceful co-existence has spread to the refugees from Iberia after the expulsion of Muslims and Jews alike. Djerba in particular is now party to an influx of Jews from Iberia."

 ME_Tunis_Events.13.d: "As our foothold in the Iberian peninsula grows, our Muslim brothers are emboldened by our victories to approach us, asking if we require any assistance. The Mudejar, who have been oppressed by the Christians ever since the end of the Reconquista, are particularly eager to help in whatever way possible to fight back against them. There are surely more of our brothers waiting and in hiding, ready to be freed from oppression. Let us put the Mudejar to great use, and reward their unwavering faith!"

 ME_Tunis_Events.22.t: "The Emirate of Sicily"
 ME_Tunis_Events.22.d: "The Emirate of Sicily ruled the island of Sicily from 831 to 1091, conquered from the hands of the Byzantines by our ancestors. Its capital, Balarm, became a major cultural and political centre of the Muslim world during this time period. \n\nUnder Muslim rule, the island became increasingly prosperous and cosmopolitan, with trade and agriculture flourishing. Sicily would become multiconfessional and multilingual, developing a distinct Arab-Byzantine culture that combined elements of Islamic Arab and Berber migrants with those of the local Byzantine-Greek and Jewish communities. The Emirate would eventually fracture from internal strife and dynastic disputes, until Norman conquests of the region would end Islamic rule in Sicily in 1091. Nonetheless, Siculo-Arabic influence still remains a strong preence to this day.\n\nWith our own conquests of Sicily, we have the chance to re-establish the Emirate of Sicily under our banner, taking advantage of the the lingering Siculo-Arabic culture and legitimise our claims to the region or we can keep the prosperous and fertile lands for ourselves."
 ME_Tunis_Events.22.a: "Restore the Emirate under our banner."
