 dse_flavour_socotra.1.t: "St. Thomas Relics"
 dse_flavour_socotra.1.d: "One of our raiding parties has returned with some interesting relics, which are of Malankaran origin. The teaching of St. Thomas have clearly worked in south of India and as they are our brothers and sisters perhaps it more prudent to learn from them. As Coptics, our Holy sites are far and worst of all - not on islands! We can do no pilgrimages or protect such sites. Were we to convert, it would allow our faith and prayers to be less reliant on the whims of foreign powers."
 dse_flavour_socotra.1.o1: "But the flag..."
 dse_flavour_socotra.1.o2: "Hang whoever suggested this and deal with any remaining heretics."
