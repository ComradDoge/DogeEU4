 dse_gnostic_religious_events.1.t: "Consequences of Missionary Efforts"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.1.d: "The ongoing missionary efforts in one of our provinces have caused a great indignation among our clergy. According to the principles of our religion, it is impossible for unbelievers to convert to [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Only by birth alone does one become a follower of our faith. We are called to withdraw our missionaries."
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.1.a: "Our behavior was just wrong"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.1.b: "If our faith wants to survive, we must missionize"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.2.t: "Heretical Writings"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.2.d: "In our libraries, more and more writings have appeared which the clergy have clearly designated as heretical. They demand that their books and records will be destroyed and the writers severely punished. However, we could take advantage of this situation to extort some money from the authors and let them get away with it."
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.2.a: "Execute the authors"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.2.b: "Make them pay for their protection"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.3.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Light"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.3.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has received a flattering nickname among the common people through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] benevolent, meek and just rule: [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Light. Without a doubt, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is one of the most competent rulers that [Root.GetName] has ever ruled!"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.3.a: "Fabulous"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.4.t: "Apostate Coreligionists"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.4.d: "The authority of our religion is weakened, which is why it is no wonder that some not so faithful followers abandon the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Some of them have created sects or even joined infidel religions."
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.4.a: "Heretic!"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.5.t: "Interfaithful Relations"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.5.d: "There are people who claim that we are just a heresy of one of the other great religious communities. While we may share religious principles with Christians, Jews and Muslims, we set ourselves apart from them by unique characteristics and can insist on an independent faith. We can use this situation to our advantage by easily maintaining friendly relationships with our putative brothers in faith."
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.5.a: "Wonderful"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.6.t: "Satanistic Secret Cult"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.6.d: "Rumors are spreading at the court of [Root.GetName]. It is said that a secret religious cult that worships the Lord of Evil himself would have existed for some time in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. We must not tolerate such blasphemy and Satanism!"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.6.a: "Fight them"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.6.b: "Ignore them"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.7.t: "Syncretism Unpopular"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.7.d: "Our religion and culture have always been strongly influenced by surrounding peoples, whose influences are still an integral part of our nation today. Many of our subjects have begun to understand this syncretism as assimilation, fearing that the remaining [Root.Culture.GetName] traditions will sooner or later disappear completely."
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.7.a: "Terrible"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.8.t: "Education of [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.8.d: "Our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] is still young and has a lot to learn in order to become a good ruler later on. Our advisors suggest hiring one of the best scholars in the country to teach [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] a pious and wise life in the years to come. That would be an expensive measure, but it would pay off in the end."
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.8.a: "Good idea"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.8.b: "Bad idea"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.9.t: "Emergence of New Ceremonies"
 dse_gnostic_religious_events.9.d: "Throughout the year, we celebrate many religious and cultural festivals that are firmly anchored in the traditions of our nation. In parts of our country, people have introduced new feasts influenced by foreign religions and cultures. We need to consider how to deal with these festivals."
