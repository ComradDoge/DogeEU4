 CRDB_north_africa_title: "Secure the Strait"
 CRDB_north_africa_desc: "Control over both Sabtah and Jabal Tariq once gave us nominal control over both sides of the Gibraltar strait, enriching our state from any merchants wishing to pass through, and also allowing North African allies to easily march to our aid when needed. Our ambitions of a greater Andalusian state lie in first regaining this stranglehold over the only entrance to the Mediterranean."
 CRDB_crush_portugal_title: "Crush Portugal"
 CRDB_crush_portugal_desc: "The western regions of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by the Portuguese centuries ago, and it has been a distant dream to retake these lands ever since. Despite the majority of those living here are now Christians, it was clear their monarchs neglected their people, if the lackluster defenses were any sign. While Portugal was not the direct aggressor in the centuries of the Reconquista, their friendship with the Castilians has damaged any hope of reconciliation. Restoration of Muslim control over these lands will bring them new hope, reignite our naval ambitions of past times!"
 CRDB_caliphate_of_cordoba_title: "Caliphate of Cordoba"
 CRDB_caliphate_of_cordoba_desc: "After centuries of hardship and decadence, trials of faith and tribulations in under Christian crusades and decades of conflict and loss, we have finally restored what the Umayyads had once achieved - a united Al-Andalus. We have shown Islam the strength of our nation, our courage and righteousness, and we have shown that our [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty] rulers have not led us astray, even in the times where we question our faith. We have shown that our swords can defend Islam from crusading heathens, and over this time period, the Andalusian people have felt they have finally become part of a greater cause."
 CRDB_dar_jihad_title: "Dar Jihad"
 CRDB_dar_jihad_desc: "As a nation encountering a blend of cultures, beliefs and languages, even as we practice religious sufferance and promote a focus on learning, we will inevitably encounter conflicts. Given that most of these will be primarily religious, the Andalusian states of old have been called 'Dar Jihad', or a nation of Jihad. Most of them are still living in Andalusia and the central plains today, under the cruel rule of the Castilians. Let us free them."
 CRDB_push_the_portuguese_title: "Push the Infidels"
 CRDB_push_the_portuguese_desc: "Push the Portuguese back to their highland hideouts! The waterways along the Aveiro are great natural fortifications against enemy marches. With a reconquest of a majority of the former Portuguese lands, we can once again re-establish a strong rule over the Western March."
 CRDB_covadonga_title: "Avenge Covadonga"
 CRDB_covadonga_desc: "Covadonga it is!"
 CRDB_tulaytulah_title: "Taifa of Tulaytullah"
 CRDB_tulaytulah_desc: "The Taifa of Toledo was an independent Islamic state located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, ruled by the Dhulnunids, a Hawwara Berber clan. It emerged after 1018 upon the fracturing of the Khilafat Qurtubah, when the Dhulnunids, already strong in the lands of Santaver, Cuenca, Huete and Uclés, seized control over the city of Toledo, the capital of the Middle March of Al-Andalus. Upon later territorial conquest, the taifa also expanded to the land of Calatrava. It lasted until the Christian conquest of Toledo in 1085."
 CRDB_to_north_title: "To The North!"
 CRDB_to_north_desc: "The restoration of Al-Andalus is almost complete, and glory of Al-Andalus once again flows through the cities of Iberia. It is clear the Christian kingdoms are once again no match for Islam, and our grip over these lands gains strength with each passing day. However, we once made the mistake of allowing the remnants of Christian states to remain in the Peninsula, and we paid for it with several centuries of hardship and stagnation, with our faith decimated by the crusaders. Let us not make the same mistake again, and eliminate the last vestiges of the Christian kingdoms, once and for all!"
 CRDB_toulouse_title: "Reconquer Toulouse"
 CRDB_toulouse_desc: "The last time that Toulouse was in Muslim hands, was at the apex of Umayyad power in the 8th century, when they conquered Septimania from the hands of the Visigoths. Our ambitions to push into greater Europe lie in first establishing a foothold in Tolouse."
 CRDB_muwashshah_title: "Muwashshah"
 CRDB_muwashshah_desc: "During the glorious times of Umayyad Al-Andalus, life in Andalusia was idyllic. The encouragement of education, culture and the arts triggered an explosion in poetry, known as Muwashshah - a product and a microcosm of the cultural fusion particular to al-Andalus. The linguistic interplay between the standard written languages —Arabic and Hebrew — and the oral forms—Andalusi vernacular Arabic, Romance, and Mozarabic — reflect the fluidity and diversity of the linguistic landscape of the nation."
 CRDB_zaragoza_title: "Taifa of Saraqusta"
 CRDB_zaragoza_desc: "The taifa of Saraqusta was an independent Arab Muslim state in the east of Al-Andalus under the rule of the Banu tribes, established in 1018 as one of the taifa kingdoms, with its capital in Saraqusta. It emerged following the destruction of the Khilafat Qurtubah in the Moorish controlled Iberian Peninsula. They would eventually fall to the Almoravids, and the Zaragozan armies would eventually serve the Aragonese kingdom."
 CRDB_saqalibah_title: "The Saqalibah"
 CRDB_saqalibah_desc: "Saqalibas, referring to European slaves first, then West African slave soldiers, serve the Andalusian state in a multitude of ways, such as Caliphal guards, mercenaries and eunuchs, least of all in a military role not too dissimilar to mamluks in the Ottoman Empire. As we receive envoys from our overlord and slaves come in from across their lands, eventually we will encounter a saqalibah of outstanding character."
 CRDB_develop_cordoba_title: "Develop Qurtubah"
 CRDB_develop_cordoba_desc: "First taken by Muslim forces in 711, Qurtubah was governed under direct Arab rule for the next several centuries and made the provincial capital. At the apex of Umayyad power, the city was the political capital, as well as a cultural, academic and economic centre of not just the Khilafat Qurtubah, but of Europe as a whole. Qurutubah, once again under new administration, has been devastated by years of intense religious and ideological conflict. Quturbah was once a conduit between Islamic and Christian worlds, and it should be once more. Let us restore the city to its former glory."
 CRDB_centre_of_learning_title: "Relive the Golden Age"
 CRDB_centre_of_learning_desc: "The mosques, as places of both worship and learning, have long brought prosperity to Andalusia, with all manor of people arriving in the ports. From those simply wanting to trade their wares, to those who seek a better education, enlightenment or even living a new life here. With the addition of expeditions to the new world, and the riches they bring back; right now is the Golden Age of culture and enlightenment."
 CRDB_strengthen_military_title: "New Conscripts"
 CRDB_strengthen_military_desc: "In order to protect the Cordoban borders from Christian invasion once again, we will need to fortify the garrisons. Centuries of conflict have left our trained armies depleted, so we will need to look for new consripts."
 CRDB_berbers_title: "Recruit Berbers"
 CRDB_berbers_desc: "As we encourage the migrating Berbers to settle in our lands in Upper Andalusia, some of them are already seeing themselves as citizens of the Emirate, and wish to take up arms against the Castilians. Many of them volunteered because they saw the defense of Muslims as their religious duty."

 ME_Cordoba_Events.2.t: "A Rising Star"
 ME_Cordoba_Events.2.d: "Rumours amongst our soldiers at battle front claim of a strong young man under the [From.GetTag] banner that has been steadily rising through the ranks, and has already reached the rank of general. They say he has eyes of a hawk, able to watch the entire battlefield and make intelligent strategic decisions even in the thick of the fighting. They also say he is unrivalled with the sword, defeating every opponent he has face, on and off the field. Time will tell if these claims are true."

 ME_Cordoba_Events.5.t: "New Ambitions of Cordoba"
 ME_Cordoba_Events.5.d: "The traditional values of the Granadan people have long been adapted for a life of hardship and defence, and to value the little things in life. Now however, as we aid in their resurge to prominence in the region, these values are no longer align to what the Cordoban state needs. They should no longer need to barricade their homes and keep permanent town garrisons. Instead, they should be outside enjoying the wonders of life, exploring the world as it is, and strengthening their unity as a nation."
 ME_Cordoba_Events.5.a: "Together, we are unstoppable."
 ME_Cordoba_Events.5.b: "They should keep their own ways!"
 
 ME_Cordoba_Events.6.t: "Silk of Cordoba"
 ME_Cordoba_Events.6.d: "Silkworm cultivation was introduced in Al-Andalus in the 8th century; brought to the region when the Qaysis from Syria established themselves on the fertile plains of Al-Andalus. The adoption of this practice was widespread, but particularly high-quality silk was to be found in Qurtubah, Garnatah and Balansiyah, especially when the Umayyads financed the start of the tiraz industry, royal workshops where sumptuous textiles were made. Abd-er-Rahman II founded one of these workshops in the al-Qaysariyya of Qurtubah, located by the mosque. Its productions were very much acclaimed due to the beauty of its designs and the excellence of the materials used in the hands of highly qualified craftsmen.\n\nThese creations met the demands of a material for the manufacture of luxury clothes and accessories which bedecked the highest positions of Al-Andalus, like caliphs and emirs, mainly for ceremonial dress. Traders from the nearby mercantile Genoa, Venice and even the Byzantines have long been patrons of the silk produced in Al-Andalus - such is the hegemony of Andalusian silk in the Mediterranean. By reinvigorating the textile industry in Cordoba traders from all across the known world will contend for the silk, and will enrich our realm tremendously."
