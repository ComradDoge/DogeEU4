 # Generic Franconian Missions:
 FKN_build_an_army_title: "Build an Army"
 FKN_build_an_army_desc: "Our aim is to achieve the unification of the duchies and bishoprics making up Franconia. Building up an army would help maintain our borders and expand into new lands. The future of Franconia depends on our willingness to take action, and therefore we must make sure we have enough forcess to do so!"
 FKN_conquer_nuremburg_title: "Annex Nürnberg"
 FKN_conquer_nuremburg_desc: "The city-state of Nuremburg is well defended; a great fortress makes up the exterior of the city itself. To control it will be a difficult task, that is no trick. Still, with proper execution of newly developed siege techniques, the walls of Nuremburg can be overcome, and we can use the vast fortress for our own purposes!"
 FKN_conquer_wurzburg_title: "Subjugate Wurzburg"
 FKN_conquer_wurzburg_desc: "The Bishoprics of Wurzburg and Bamberg claim to be protected by God, but God alone will not save them from us. Their influence in Franconian politics is too big to go unchecked, so we have to make sure they are out of the picture before they become diplomatically dominant over the region."
 FKN_conquer_ansbach_title: "Subdue Ansbach"
 FKN_conquer_ansbach_desc: "The House of Hohenzollern rules the quaint Duchy of Ansbach, and as such they have dynastic ties to Brandenburg, a far greater power than us. Their state is set to be under union with Brandenburg once their ruler dies, and so if we don't act fast we'll have to deal with a union. For the continued autonomy of Franconia, Ansbach must be eliminated."
 FKN_conquer_north_bavaria_title: "North Bayern"
 FKN_conquer_north_bavaria_desc: "Bavaria is not Franconian, but it exercises great power and influence in the region. Although they are a wealthy and strong country, the Austrians and Swabians think lowly of the Bavarians. We should seek out an alliance with powers opposed to Bavarian hegemony over South Germany and take them down before they expand too much."
 FKN_conquer_oberpfalz_title: "Conquer Oberpfalz"
 FKN_conquer_oberpfalz_desc: "The Palatinate of the Rhine controls a holding to the west of Franconia, which is beginning to exercise influence over the region. The city of Oberpfalz has evolved from a small town to a political center under the Palatinate, and needs to be conquered in order to preserve Franconian Culture."
 FKN_conquer_mainz_title: "Crush Mainz"
 FKN_conquer_mainz_desc: "An important bishopric and elector, Mainz has been a thorn in our side for many years, threatening the legitimacy of Franconia as it stands. They do not stand a chance against our might. This may anger the Papacy, but it is necessary for the Franconian unification."
 FKN_form_franconia_title: "Franconia is United"
 FKN_form_franconia_desc: "The time has finally come to unite the old Franconian Duchy of Charlemagne once again. The unification process has taken a toll on our men, our lands, our culture, and maybe even our faith. We have faced many foes, from the Austrians and Bavarians, to the Swabians and Westphalians. So with all the hardships overcome by our will, we can finally say Three Hurrahs for Franconia!"
