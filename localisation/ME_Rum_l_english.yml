 # Events:
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME1: "A Rootless Tree"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC1: "Wars are a double-edged sword. For some, it brings fortunes, loot and legend. For others it is the bringer of death, famine, despair and agony. Whilst the common peasantry is irrelevant to us, in its struggle coping with war, we were recently approached by a noble of the Zapolya house, with a claim on the [TRA.GetAdjective] lands. His proposition is none other than eternal fielty as long as we restore his rule over the [TRA.GetAdjective] lands."
 ME_Rum_Events1.EVTOPT1: "Our tree hath many branches ..."
 ME_Rum_Events1.EVTOPT2: "... but none for heathen scum!"
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME2: "The [Root.GetName]-Patriarchate Synod"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC2: "Tensions between us and our Christian subjects are high. Whilst we have been successful at either converting the majority of the population to our Faith or tolerating them, it seems as if there'll always be trouble. Thus, we should hold a formal Synod and discuss with the heads of their religion potential compromise and consessions, if any at all."
 ME_Rum_Events2.EVTOPT1: "Let us make consessions."
 ME_Rum_Events2.EVTOPT2: "Cut the snake's head."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME3: "Administrating Egypt"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC3: "A series of bloody campaigns and conquests have come to an end, Egypt is now under our boot. However, many advisors in our court argue that an Empire of that size is quite hard to administrate. They advocate in favor of the istallation of a semi-autonomous state in the Delta, essentially restoring the Mamluk rule under our banner. They hypothetize that mingling both our bureaucratic and administration ways will give birth to a better and modern government. What shall we do?"
 ME_Rum_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Let us co-exist and learn from one another."
 ME_Rum_Events3.EVTOPT2: "Reign it with an iron fist."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME4: "Atlantis of the Sands"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC4: "A legendary lost city in the southern Arabian sands, claimed to have been destroyed by a natural disaster or as a punishment by God, the Atlantis of Sands shall make an excellent addition to our sum of prestigious conquests."
 ME_Rum_Events4.EVTOPT1: "Iram of the Pillars awaits."
 ME_Rum_Events4.EVTOPT2: "We have better things to do."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME5: "The Levantine Border"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC5: "Pushing further down south, it appearsthat the people inhabiting the Levant strip of Syria and Aleppo are not as different from us as we once thought. Sharing a common culture and religion and despite our opposite sides in the war, we may be able to reason with their locals and qwell any rebellions peacefully instead of enforcing our dominion."
 ME_Rum_Events5.EVTOPT1: "Let us negotiate."
 ME_Rum_Events5.EVTOPT2: "These savages shall know the whip."
 ME_Rum_Events5.EVTOPT3: "Allow them some autonomy."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME6: "Jewel of the Levant"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC6: "Centuries of conflict and military campaigns fought over this one city. And now it is ours, ours to do with it as we please, burn it, rebuild it or even remodel it and leave our imprint in history, every such opinion finds supporters. However, conquering such an important landmark comes with its perks too and it is up to us to decide on how to use such a beautiful metropolis."
 ME_Rum_Events6.EVTOPT1: "Let us dress it in our colors."
 ME_Rum_Events6.EVTOPT2: "Let us send a message to the Pope."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME8: "The Slave Nobility"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC8: "Warriors who saw the rise and fall of many Empires, the so-called Slave Nobility of the last Empire of the Delta is now nothing but a speck of dust in the books of history. Crushed under the might of our Janissary corps these feeble nobles now seek refuge under us, promising to share their knowlege with us in return."
 ME_Rum_Events8.EVTOPT1: "There is much we can learn from them."
 ME_Rum_Events8.EVTOPT2: "Use their legitimacy for our conquest."
 ME_Rum_Events8.EVTOPT3: "Their blood shall sate the people."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME9: "Expand the Rumi Bureaucracy"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC9: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] was probably the greatest of the Ottoman Sultans. Dubbed 'Lawgiver', he was an unsurpassed administrator who realized that the power of the provincial Beys had to be curbed by a strong central government. Thus he struggled to promote a powerful royal bureaucracy which was not popular in all camps..."
 ME_Rum_Events9.EVTOPT1: "Expand the Rumi Bureaucracy."
 ME_Rum_Events9.EVTOPT2: "Limited Reforms."
 ME_Rum_Events9.EVTOPT3: "Reduce the Royal Bureaucracy."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME10: "Protector of the Pilgrimage"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC10: "Following the spectacularly successful Mamluk campaign, [Root.Monarch.GetName] accepted the homage of the sharif of Mecca and adopted the title 'Servant of the Two Holy Places' (Khadim al-Haramayn), pledging to protect the security of the pilgrims traveling to Mecca and Medina each year for the hajj rituals required by the Muslim faith. Defense of the pilgrimage routes henceforth became one of the most significant sources of legitimacy and prestige for the Rumidynasty, as it was a role of immeasurable importance for all Muslims which no other dynasty could claim to fulfill."
 ME_Rum_Events10.EVTOPT1: "Assume the title of Khadim al-Haramayn."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME11: "The Age of the Köprülüs"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC11: "Born around 1575 in the village of Radnick in Albania, Mehmed Köprülü was a young Christian boy taken by the devshirme system (abducted and raised in the Muslim faith, just like most Janissary troops). He started his career as a cook, then moved to the Treasury. A pasha in central Anatolia, he gained a name for himself as an excellent and honest administrator - a rare creature in the Rumi Empire. On 15th September 1656 he was appointed Grand Vizier by the mother of the young sultan Mehmed IV. A fierce fighter of corruption, he enacted many successful reforms, balanced the budget and led the war against Venice. After his death in 1661, his son Fazil Ahmed 'the Virtuous' succeeded him and governed till 1676. Other Grand Viziers such as Kara Mustafa (1676-1683), Mustafa Pasha (1689-1691) and Hussein Pasha (1697-1702) were his direct heirs."
 ME_Rum_Events11.EVTOPT1: "Let us rely on the Köprülü family."
 ME_Rum_Events11.EVTOPT2: "Rely on more popular advisors."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME12: "Matters of Education"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC12: "Scrolls and books gathered from all four corners of the Empire amass at the Imperial Library in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Scholars and men of the pen make their way to our capital in order to catch a glimpse of the knowledge held within. It would be wise to use all that expertise in order to hone [Root.Heir.GetName] and make him into a great ruler."
 ME_Rum_Events12.EVTOPT1: "Let him study administration."
 ME_Rum_Events12.EVTOPT2: "He will make a great diplomat."
 ME_Rum_Events12.EVTOPT3: "He shall mediate over matters of war."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME13: "The Phoenix and The Eagle"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC13: "For years our two countries have co-existed, blending and meddling in each other's daily affairs. Having put our differences aside, perhaps it is time we formalize the betrothal of our two administrations and give birth to a new form of Government, better and more modernized than ever. By allowing Egyptian ideas to flow into our administration, we shall aim at maximizing not only our administrative efficiency but also study their ways."
 ME_Rum_Events13.EVTOPT1: "Let the Egyptian Eagle serve us proudly!"
 ME_Rum_Events13.EVTOPT2: "We cannot risk losing our identity."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME14: "Conflict and Profit"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC14: "As we march forth colonizing and seizing land in the name of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we appear to be in a dilemma. Every member of the board of advisors agrees that Zanzibar is vital for the expansion of our international profiteering companies however breaking the Rumi embargo in Eastern Africa would require force and thus risk open conflict."
 ME_Rum_Events14.EVTOPT1: "Africa belongs to the [Root.GetAdjective]."
 ME_Rum_Events14.EVTOPT2: "We will allow it for now."
 
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTNAME15: "Europeans in Zanzibar"
 ME_Rum_Events.EVTDESC15: "As we wrestle control of Zanzibar in our favor, more and more European merchants attempt to break into the Eastern African markets. Should we continue to enforce our mercantilism, we risk sparking an international incident. However, voices on the other side of the isle in our midst speak of a European invasion platform in Africa, a threat to our African holdings and a loss of income from trading with India and beyond. This is a delicate matter and we cannot afford igniting an aggressive war against Europe."
 ME_Rum_Events15.EVTOPT1: "Let's not risk an open conflict."
