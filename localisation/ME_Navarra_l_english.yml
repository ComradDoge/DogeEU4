 NAV_revenge_on_castile_title: "Antso Gartzez' Inheritance"
 NAV_revenge_on_castile_desc: "Sancho III, or Antso Nagusia (Sancho the Great), was the ruler of our kingdom at its greatest extent, holding all of Vasconia and the county of Castile. But on his death, his inheritance was split between his children, and our great kingdom would be divided 4 ways, never to be united since. 400 years have passed, but our house still has some little claim to this land, and the conquest of the County of Castile would certainly cement us as a rising power in Iberia. Furthermore, it would ensure that our fellow Basques to the west no longer have to fear the oppressive taxman of the Spanish, a most worthy goal"
 NAV_kingdom_of_navarra_title: "Nafarroako Foru Orokorra"
 NAV_kingdom_of_navarra_desc: "The Nafarroako Foru Orokorra, or the General Charter of the Navarre, is the loose code of laws, formalized in writing since 1238, that determines the relationship between the Errege (King) and the Jaurerriak and other nobles, and set in place Judicial procedures. This charter requires regular Royal confirmation, but has remained without amendment since 1330. It is important for us to issue regular amendments to our code of laws, to ensure that the royal authority continues to be respected throughout our Kingdom."
 NAV_origins_title: "Archdiocese of Pampalona"
 NAV_origins_desc: "Since Roman times, Pampalona has been an important religious center in northern Iberia, being the seat of religious authority throughout the Basque Country. In the days of Antso Gartzez, Pampalona was a major cultural and economic center across Iberia, and along with it the local religious authorities held great sway. It is possible that with investment into both the Church and the city of Pampalona more generally, we may be able to recapture something of those glory days."
 NAV_bando_gerrak_title: "End the Bando Gerrak"
 NAV_bando_gerrak_desc: "For many decades, the Basque people, both in our country and our neighbors, have been crippled by the §YWar of the Bands§!. No longer must we tolerate this state of affairs! The Hermandades have won a great victory in our name, and Pampalona and Bilbao are now fully under our control. Certainly, this is a time for celebration, but we must not rest on our laurels, for this is the perfect opportunity to exploit the continued destabilization of our neighbors by this conflict, and to press our rightful claims on the rest of Euskal Herria."
 NAV_claims_in_aragon_title: "Reclamation of Aragón"
 NAV_claims_in_aragon_desc: "Aragón was once a possession of the crown of Pampalona, but through the successive inheritances of Antso Nagusia and his son, Gartzea Naiarakoa, this land was lost entirely, and united instead with Catalonia, the foundations of the modern Aragonese state. The reconquest of the county of Aragón should be a high priority for [Root.Monarch.GetName], as it will give us a strong economic base and defensible position for our further conquests."
 NAV_greater_vasconia_title: "Batua Euskal Herria Da"
 NAV_greater_vasconia_desc: "Finally, our toil and strife is at an end. No longer will the Basque people be oppressed by the Castilians, or the Aragonese, or the French, or the English, or the numerous others throughout history that have attempted to prevent us from speaking our language and celebrating our culture. We can now focus all our attention on the most pressing and important of pursuits, that which is at the heart of every Basque man; the exploration of the Atlantic, the hunting of the many whales, and the establishment of a great colonial empire in the lands beyond.\n\n§BBatua euskal herria da - (roughly) Greater Vasconia is United§!"
 NAV_nation_of_basques_title: "A Nation of Basques"
 NAV_nation_of_basques_desc: "Navarra may be the Basque country in name, but many of our subjects are Castilian, Aragonese, or Gascon. These are the men that pay taxes into our treasury, fight in our wars, and most notably comprise the local nobility; as all know, a Basque man wants nothing more than to be sailing halfway across the world. If we are to be Basque in more than just name, we must encourage the spread of our culture, either by pressing it upon the locals in our land, or by encouraging the settlement of our Basque citizenry across our kingdom."
 NAV_armada_title: "[Root.GetAdjective] Armada"
 NAV_armada_desc: "By establishing ourselves as a Naval Power, we can finally assert true control over the waters of Northern Iberia, and secure our position and our trade. With the wood of the old world, we can finally afford to construct a fleet to rival the powers of Europe, an investment to once and for all secure our future."
 NAV_vascon_gasconia_title: "Vascon Gasconia"
 NAV_vascon_gasconia_desc: "The Basques are split by a great mountain range; and to the north our independence is a contentious matter. Of course, we hold the Merindad of Ultrapeurtos across the range, but this small town is of little importance when the other Basques throughout Gascony are oppressed by foreign lords. It is imperative that we reconquer this land while the conflict between the French and the English keeps it destabilized, so we can establish a safe home for our brothers across the mountains."
 NAV_strong_navy_title: "Seafaring on the High Seas"
 NAV_strong_navy_desc: "Sailing the coastal waters of Europe is certainly a respectable profession, but it is a trifling matter for those such as us. Indeed, it is our destiny to rise to greater things, to explore and chart the open ocean, where less able sailors would quaver in terror, in their superstitious ways. We must construct a fleet that will enable us to sail into waters far afield, to weather the harsh storms of the open ocean, and return home in one piece."
 NAV_new_state_title: "Trans-Atlantic Statebuilding"
 NAV_new_state_desc: "While our population grows at home, our land, arid and already dense, has little prospects for new settlements. But our settlements across the ocean are a different matter entirely. The land is perfectly suited to farm, forests provide us with higher quality wood than we have access to in Europe, and the ample coastline provides a real bounty of fish, and more exotic seafood like lobsters. Let us send our excess population to this new extension of our state, so that the sons of the Basque country may prosper and our rule may prosper with them."
 NAV_wealth_of_america_title: "Wealth of New Navarra"
 NAV_wealth_of_america_desc: "We are at the dawn of a new age in Basque history. One where, finally, we have a land to call our own, with no pressure from foreign occupiers. The entirity of the wealth of this land is ours for the taking. We must make haste in exploting it!"
 NAV_basque_mariners_title: "Basque Mariners"
 NAV_basque_mariners_desc: "Finally, we have reclaimed our access to the coast, and the perfidious Castilians and French can no longer control our sailing and whaling. It is imperative that we construct a war fleet, to ensure that this coast remains ours, and that our trade stays out of the clutches of pirates and privateers alike."
 NAV_basque_whaling_title: "North Sea Whaling"
 NAV_basque_whaling_desc: "From the Bay of Biscay, to Norway, to the Westfjords of Iceland, and even further beyond in snow-crusted lands, the sailors of the Basque country hear the call of the Whale. Our sailors go far afield to earn money from the most valueable trade we know, and then sail even further to sell the products of their labor. Should we ourselves establish a more formal trading presence in the North Sea, the profits will surely be bountiful."
 NAV_whaling_america_title: "Whaling in America"
 NAV_whaling_america_desc: "Iceland and Greenland know our sailors just as they know their whales. And so, they have heard of seas further west, from where it is said the whales swim from. In Europe, and even as far as Iceland, there is competition, as our Whalers are not the only ones plying their trade. But should we go further to untouched seas, we will surely find more whales to chase and hunt, and significantly less competition in securing our catch."
 NAV_landing_title: "Making a Landing"
 NAV_landing_desc: "We have mapped the coasts, and identified the perfect locations to setup our first port in this faraway land. Unlike the westfjords or other portions of the North Sea, the locals are few and far between, and the coast seems open for the taking, so our explorers recommend a permanent settlement, rather than a mere trading post. Who knows, even something as fundamentally absurd as a contact language between the Basque settlers and the various Algonquin locals might emerge!"
 NAV_a_new_home_title: "A New Home"
 NAV_a_new_home_desc: "In the past, a Basque woman or man would always be born in the Basque Country. Yes, they would sail to far away lands, hunt whales in distant seas, and trade exotic goods with strange merchants. But always, there would be a fundamental longing for home, the Basque Country, a land that was near and dear to every one of our sailors and mariners.\nNow, many who are undoubtedly Euskalduna have never even seen the old homeland. They hail instead from our lands across the ocean. Indeed, the very center of our power has begun to drift to this new land, a place of boundless natural wealth and without the presence of oppressive neighbors like our homes in Europe. Should we formalize this emerging state of affairs, or retain the idea of a distant homeland across the sea?"
 NAV_access_to_sea_title: "Access to the Seas"
 NAV_access_to_sea_desc: "The Basque people are inclined to sailing like no others, and our superiorty in matters of navigation and exploration are well known by all. Already, our sailors whale in the north sea under the command of foreign whalers and merchants, or fight in the navies of the Castilians and Aragonese. So, it is a shame that we have no coast of our own, from which to conduct whaling and exploration under our own crown and charter. Perhaps we could do something to fix this lack?"
 NAV_unknown_seas_title: "Tales of Unknown Seas"
 NAV_unknown_seas_desc: "Everyone knows the world is round, but the other side is mighty far away. This leaves us with a near-endless ocean, between our land and the riches that lie halfway across the globe. Lesser men would seek to explore this ocean, for the hope of acquiring these riches. But we are Euskaldunak, and we will explore these oceans for the joy of exploration!"
 NAV_america_discovery_title: "The Fabled Continent"
 NAV_america_discovery_desc: "We have sought the end of the vast western oceans, and finally, our sailors have returned with reports of land. Not mere islands, but land in truth, with forests extending for miles at end; a land with an endless coast stretching both north and south, possibly to the ends of the world; a land with much potential for trade, lying on a sea filled with whales. Let us make haste and chart this land, so we may settle it before our rivals."
 NAV_exploring_new_land_title: "The Lost Legend"
 NAV_exploring_new_land_desc: "The natives in the south are aggressive, protective of their ways, and difficult to trade with. But when we have given them generous gifts, and loosened their tongues with alcohol from home, they speak in hushed whispers of El Dorado, and of the Seven Cities of Gold. Already, brave basque warriors like Pedro de Ursúa and El Loco have petitioned us to organize an expedition, and locate these cities which are said to hold wealth beyond our wildest dreams. If nothing else, it will undoubtedly help us in charting the vast lands we have found ourselves the stewards of."
 
 # Decision
 NAV_end_the_bando_gerrak_title: "@[Root.GetTag] End the Bando Gerrak"
 NAV_end_the_bando_gerrak_desc: "The §YWar of the Bands§! has been raging for decades, and has crippled the crown's ability to administer our own land. Today, the Legizamon family fights the Zurbarán family in Bilbao, and the Gamboinos fight the Oñaz in Gipuzkoa. We must support the Hermandades, who will always be loyal to us, in their attempts to end this conflict; so we can crush the forces of these families and ensure they no longer have the economic base to keep waging this senseless war. Do we finally have the power and authority to curb this conflict once and for all?"

 ME_estate_burghers_NAV_privileges_of_the_union_desc: "Privilege of the Union, or Privilege of the Three Burghs was a law enacted by the Navarrese King in 1423 by Charles the III the Noble, uniting the three Burghs of Pamplona into one, hoping to end the constant conflict between them."

 ME_Navarra_Events.3.t: "Nafarroa Berria"
 ME_Navarra_Events.3.d: "Thirty years ago, young Zorion, with only 8 years to his name, set foot on a ship with his Father. This was nothing new for him; his father was a fisherman, and Zorion was as comfortable on the sea as he was in his cottage back home. But what was new was the size of this ship; it was no fishermans skiff, but a vessel built to sail the open ocean. Zorion, with his family, were leaving Europe, to seek their fortune in a new land. It was said that the prospects in this new land, for fishing, farming, or any sort of work far exceeded that at home, and so Zorion's father set out to make his fortune.\n\nToday, Zorion, a fisherman, landowner, and pillar of his local community, has children of his own. They are as Basque as Zorion and his father before him: they speak the language and follow the traditions passed down. But to them, home is not the mountains in Vasconia, or the plains near Pampalona, or the dry hills of northern Iberia. To Zorion's children, the home is the coast of the American continent, with its thick forests, endless fish, and harsh winds and winters.\n\nTales like Zorion's are a dime a dozen in our new land, which far outpaces in size, population, and wealth, our homeland in Europe. Even our monarchy is not left unchanged by this transition, and our Kings find themselves spending years at a time in the lands across the Atlantic, which are always in dire need of a Monarch's personal touch. It is important then, that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] considers the important questions of identity and tradition, and what it means to be Euskalduna."

As conflict rages between the major noble families and their Bands of armed thugs, our ability to control and govern our capital ever dwindles. Many decades prior, the Hermandades, loyal to the crown, were able to establish peace in the region, at our expense. Just two years ago in 1442, they attempted to intervene in Bilbao and Mondragón, but were not successful. We must ensure that their next intervention receieves the full support of the crown, so we can finally put this conflict to rest."

 # Notes:
 # - nation of basque should require 45 dev in basque provinces in Europe! As it is i can get 4 provinces in every colonial region and easily complete this achievement
