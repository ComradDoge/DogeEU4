 misc_events.2.t: "Restoration of the Pentarchy"
 misc_events.2.d: "Now that the Pentarchy has been restored, Roman Catholicism has been deemed a heresy by the Eastern Orthodox Church, which now has influence over the traditional five moral leaders of Christianity. They are calling on us Protestants to adhere to the Pentarchy as well. This would once again mean the moral leaders of our church live in a foreign land. Should we convert?"
 misc_events.2.a: "Yes, we must submit to the new Christian order."
 misc_events.2.b: "No, we do not want to sacrifice our religious independence."
