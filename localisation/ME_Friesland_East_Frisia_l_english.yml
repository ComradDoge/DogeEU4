 FRI_woe_at_westphalia_title: "Imperial Encroachment"
 FRI_woe_at_westphalia_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is filled with nations that refuse to give their people freedom. Following our principles, we should seperate from and fight such a repressive institution to free them head on. We could however, take a more deceptive route, and act from within the feudal hegemon. We would be forced to have a surface level of loyalty to a repressive system, however."
 FRI_hoofdelingen_title: "The Hoofdelingen"
 FRI_hoofdelingen_desc: "The Hoofdelingen, or Chieftans, have recently found success developing their towns, and have slowly grown their industries. This lead to an increase in state income, and the rise of certain men who took advantage of others to grow small fortunes."
 FRI_grietmannen_title: "Appoint the Grietmannen"
 FRI_grietmannen_desc: "Establishing a more central authority for law and governance, even though it might hinder some freedom for our people, is likely wise. It will ensure efficient government in line with [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decrees. We should build this centralised governance on existing institutions, and establish an office which shall report to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. It will be called the Grietmannen, and the last question is how do we choose the person for the job?"
 FRI_protect_frisian_values_title: "Protect Frisian Values"
 FRI_protect_frisian_values_desc: "Frisia has been a place of freedom for many centuries, and we plan to keep it that way. We have stayed defensive far too long, if we intend to truly defend our values, we should erase any threats to them offensively. "
 FRI_discredit_hollander_claims_title: "Restart the Oarloggen"
 FRI_discredit_hollander_claims_desc: "War against the Counts of Holland has erupted many times before, as we defended our people from their feudal repression. We are now in a position where we can instead take the upper hand, and act offensively, perhaps ending the Holland-Frisian wars for good."
 FRI_around_ijsselmeer_title: "Reclaim the Zuyderzee"
 FRI_around_ijsselmeer_desc: "The Zuyderzee was once entirely under control of Frisian peoples. That control should be re-established, lest these frisian peoples go without freedom for the rest of their squalid lives."
 FRI_unite_friesland_title: "Unite Friesland"
 FRI_unite_friesland_desc: "Friesland has been under factional strife so severe that the state has split in recent times. We should re-establish our authority, though it will take more than war to truly end our factional strife."
 FRI_magna_frisia_title: "Magna Frisia"
 FRI_magna_frisia_desc: "The Kingdom of Frisia once stood strong, only being defeated by the great Charlemagne. We have a natural claim to their title, and shall use it to establish our state among others in europe."
 FRI_netherlands_title: "The United Provinces"
 FRI_netherlands_desc: "We have brought together a sigificant portion of the lowlands under the banner of frisian freedom, and should adopt a new title to represent them, lest we become what we set out to destroy. We shall maintain our freedom!"
 FRI_upstalbeam_title: "Upstalbeam League"
 FRI_upstalbeam_desc: "More and more people have joined us in our freedom, and support for our efforts is reaching a new high. Establishment of a league of our similar states will assure our position in the world. We would rather be dead than be slaves."
 FRI_potestaat_title: "The Potestaats of Frisia"
 FRI_potestaat_desc: "The Potestaats of Frisia was once the ruling governor, according to the Karelsprivilege given by Charlemagne. While many argue whether it was ever real, it will no longer matter, as we have established our position in the world, and none dare oppose us. The Potestaat shall rule once more, as the head of Frisian Freedom!"
 FRI_north_renaissance_title: "Northern Renaissance"
 FRI_north_renaissance_desc: "Antwerpen, as the centre of early 15th century trade, was heavy in wealth and knowledge, and thus bore the first fruits of the renaissance in north-west europe. These fruits gave the prosperity to think, and thus criticise, even further north. Leading to a movement for church reform called the Devotio Moderna, calling for clergy to act piously. The Imitatio Christi was written, criticising how the clergy acted, while still not questioning traditional practices. It spread like wildfire. Who knows what seeds this criticism plants in our people's minds."
 FRI_humanism_title: "Embrace Humanism"
 FRI_humanism_desc: "A new form of religious thought has been spreading throughout our people, pricing life above all, pushing for acceptance of all religious thought, and tolerance of unbelievers. It has been a great boon to our nation, with this religious thought practicing peaceful prosperity even as religious reform shakes the rest of europe. Many wise yet threatened thinkers have escaped to our cities, and now further our industries, trade, and technology. We might be able to invite the progenitor of this thought to our court, and bask in his innovative mind, given someone has not gotten ahead of us."
 FRI_spread_frisian_freedom_title: "Spread the Freedom"

 FRI_arumer_swarte_heap_desc: "Our people have begun to feel so strongly about our efforts to spread Frisian Freedom, that they have begun to self-organise themselves into mercenary groups for our employment. While many were worthless and therefore dismissed, the best have been reorganised into a proper fighting force, and a promising captain among them, Pier Gerlofs Donia was chosen. Oddly enough, the majority of the force comes from the village of Arum, thus they elected to take the name: \"The Black army of Arum\""

 ME_Frisia_Events.3.t: "The Imperial Shackles"
 ME_Frisia_Events.3.d: "As frisian freedom demands, we cannot allow people to remain in oppression. As vigour for our principles has risen in our people, they have begun to demand we separate ourselves from the institution that is the Holy Roman Empire, due to its feudalising nature. We have resisted it so far, but they argue the risk is too great, and complete severance in our relationship to the Kaiser would protect us from further efforts to feudalise our free society. Others argue that the Kaiser has always respected our freedom, and disrespecting him will just lead to an increased effort to feudalise us from much larger threats. Of course what is most important, is that from within, we could slowly change the makeup of the empire to favour our cause, and the Kaiser could do little to object. From outside, however, he could easily step in and resist our efforts to free our neighbours. What is your decision?"
 ME_Frisia_Events.3.a: "Begone, foreign rulers!"
 ME_Frisia_Events.3.b: "We will always remain the loyal subjects of the Kaiser."
 
 ME_Frisia_Events.4.t: "Rise of the Landowners"
 ME_Frisia_Events.4.d: "The Hoofdelingen is a position of natural power among those in each village, and out of that power, many have grown a small fortune of resources. It has come to our attention these Hoofdelingen have begun to use these resources to purchase land from suffering individuals in large quantities, amassing somewhat large estates, much like those of a feudal lord. This is an interesting trend that has created a small, but powerful new class of men, much like a noble. This behaviour goes against our principles, but these men are free, like any other, to do as they wish. Crushing them likely wouldn't be seen as problematic, but neither would be leaving them to solidify their postion, as they may be useful later. If we do decide to crush them, it could be done in a multitude of ways, from simply disassembling their lands, or perhaps demanding they give up their land to the church, lest they lose their place in heaven. Either way, it is an interesting opportunity."
 ME_Frisia_Events.4.a: "We cannot change natural trends."
 ME_Frisia_Events.4.b: "Give the land to the Clergy instead!"
 ME_Frisia_Events.4.c: "Curtail their rise!"
