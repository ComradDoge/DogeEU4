In the ancient city of Rome, it was convened a council of the wisest and most learned scholars of the land. They spoke of history and law, of trade and culture, and of the many challenges that faced the Republic. Together, they crafted a new constitution, one that would ensure the freedom and prosperity of all the people of Italy.

The recognition of the title of Duke by Emperor Sigismund in 1416 certifies the growing influence of the former Savoyard county and his leadership, who can now actively devote himself to domestic politics. And so Amedeo devoted himself to drafting the first body of general laws promulgated by the House of Savoy: the Sabaudiæ Statutes, also known as General Statutes, were born, and preserved in the Turin State Archives.
