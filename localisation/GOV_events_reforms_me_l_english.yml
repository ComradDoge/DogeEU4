 GE_reform_cycle_republic.202.d: "At the top of the human hierarchy lies one man: the dictator. Though past dictators have been prone to overspending or selfish behavior, our current ruler seems to have nothing but purity in his heart as he gives freely to his subjects as they rejoice, but is a feared and efficient man if need be. The recent legislation passed seems to be working incredibly well; it is the kind of policy that would have been stopped by a convoluted governmental setup. Our simple and effective system is working great."

 GE_reform_cycle_republic.204.d: "At the top of the human hierarchy lies one man: the dictator. Though past dictators have been prone to overspending or selfish behavior, our current ruler seems to have nothing but purity in his heart as he gives freely to his subjects as they rejoice, but is a feared and efficient man if need be. The recent legislation passed seems to be working incredibly well; it is the kind of policy that would have been stopped by a convoluted governmental setup.

 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.t: "Election Tampering"
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.d: "A recent slew of complaints over the recent shift in leadership have brought forth allegations of election tampering from our peasantry. It would seem as though election results were, by some unknown entity and to an unknown degree, tampered with to match the perpetrator's desired outcome. Though we cannot reverse the damage that has already been done, a few dedicated branches of the dissenting peasants are threatening revolt if we do not provide the culprit. Who shall we present as a scapegoat?"

 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.e: "It was the cultists I tell you!"
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.f: "I must step down knowing I obtained my position through corrupt means."
 
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.206.t: "Electoral Participation"
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.206.d: "The aggressive debates that can be heard in our in our town halls might scare some foreigners that are more used to the polite politics of the nobles.

We've given them taste of self-governance, and while it's not enough to encourage separatists to rise up, some citizens are pushing for a style of governance akin to that of a confederation.
