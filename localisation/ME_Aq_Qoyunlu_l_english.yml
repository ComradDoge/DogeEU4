 #Events: 
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.1.t: "Uzun Hasan seizes the Throne"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.1.d: "In a stunning turn of events, Uzun Hasan, crown prince to the White Sheep, has seized control of the nation, forcing his way to the throne. Discontented with Cihangir's recognition of the Qara Qoyunlu's independence from the Timurids, he ascended to the throne in 1453 and waged war against the new rivals, effectively tripling the size of Aq Qoyunlu. His reign was a long and successful one, branded as Aq Qoyunlu's most successful ruler."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.1.a: "An ascension long awaited."
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.2.t: "Defeat of the Ayyubid Empire"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.2.d: "The Ayyubid State once used to span wide swathes of land, reaching from North of Syria through fringes of Egypt all the way to Yemen. Powerful controllers of the fertile crescent, touched by decadence of the ruling dynasty, their realm reduced to nothing but a bunch of rubble in the Kayfa Castle. Put out of their misery, we claim their legacy and we will be the new masters of these lands."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.2.a: "Good Riddance!"
 
 #.3 does not exist, was probably removed.
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.4.t: "The Annexation of Syria"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.4.d: "Many of the noble mamluks within Aleppo, Antiochia and other Syrian cities are deeply disgruntled with the rule of the Circassian Mamluks in Cairo. Having exploited that, we have created a puppet syrian state, to which many of the Syrian Mamluks are now flocking. Reinforced, we are ready to face the might of the Egyptian sultan."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.4.a: "The Mamluk Scourge is going to meet its fate."
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.5.t: "Capture of Tabriz"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.5.d: "Tabriz has to be the western-most city of the Persian Mainland. On the fringes of Zagros, it has been made a base of operations by our Qara Qoyunlu rivals. Expanded and now flourishing, the Shi'ite Sheep has constructed the gorgeous Blue Mosque and turned this city prosperous. Having taken the city from them, perhaps we should consider making this our capital? It would enhance our prestige and our claim to the Persian territories, it would surely alienate the tribes that comprise the Aq Qoyunlu federation."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.5.a: "Make it our capital at once!"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.5.b: "We cannot abandon our homeland."
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.6.t: "Our Western Kin"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.6.d: "The turkic tribes of the west can hardly be called tribes anymore. Having dropped the many characteristics that bound them to the steppe, they have become sedentary and founded sultanates and malikdoms of their own, greatly expanding their administrative skill. Facing the conquest of those territories, we could choose to adopt some of their techniques, which could bring us closer to sedentary lifestyle, or we could just let them be the way they are."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.6.a: "Let us adopt some of their administrative customs."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.6.b: "They have forgotten what it means to be a tribe!"
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.7.t: "Integration of the Ponts"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.7.d: "For decades straight, the Komnenos of Trebizond used to pursue a policy of strategic intermarriages with the Turkic Federation. Facing the integration of their realm into [Root.GetName], we can see the fruit of that, many of the burghers being much less-so opposed to our conquest than expected. We could consider settling some of our fellow tribesmen into these territories, to reward their loyalty."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.7.a: "Let us integrate them into [Root.GetName]."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.7.b: "Settle the Tribes into the territory."
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.8.t: "Sufi Khalil Beg Mawsilu"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.8.d: "Sufi Khalil Beg Mawsilu was a military general stemming from the Mawsilu clan of the Aq Qoyunlu federation. From an illustrious family that brought forth many skilled administrators and generals, he would make his name fighting the Mamluk Sultanate. Due to instability of the Aq Qoyunlu Sultanate at the time, he would exploit and would put a puppet on the throne, gaining de facto control over the sultanate."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.8.a: "He shall serve as our general!"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.8.b: "His talent will be unmatched in the cabinet."
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.9.t: "Qazi Isa Savaji"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.9.d: "Qazi Isa Savaji was an important Qadi whose origins are in the Iraq-e-Ajam area. Leading figure during late Uzun Hasan's rule and his successors, his past as a Qadi of Tabriz earned him many allies in the court. Influencing the court, he would spearhead reforms culminating in land reforms and more. Qazi Isa Savaji would then get embroiled in Dynastic and Court politics and would die accused of heresy and treason by Sufi Khalil Beg Mawsilu."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.9.a: "Let him serve in our court!"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.9.b: "His work will benefit Tabriz greatly."
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.10.t: "The Sahib-i-Qiran"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.10.d: "The conquest of Iran by Uzun Hasan was painted in such positive light, that the author of Kitab-i-Diyarbakriyya, Abu Bakr Tihrani, named Uzun Hasan the Sahib-i-Qiran, the first ruler to wield this title from non-Timurid Dynasty. Originally an epithet of Timur, it stands for 'Lord of the Auspicious Conjunction'. Hasan would also adopt many other titles, ranging from Padishah of Iran to the Shahanshah, the King of Kings. The glory of Aq Qoyunlu would not, however, last for very long, since but a generation down the line, Aq Qoyunlu would fall to internal strife."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.10.a: "Glory awaits [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.11.t: "Abu Bakr Tihrani - a Persian Historian"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.11.d: "Abu Bakr Tihrani was a historian with his roots in the court of the Timurid Empire. With the downfall of the empire, he would switch his allegiance to the Qara Qoyunlu Sultanate and later would become the chief historian in the Aq Qoyunlu court. He is known for having produced the Kitab-i Diyarbakriyya, the only example of a work that described the history of Aq and Qara Qoyunlu in such detail."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.11.a: "Excellent!"
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.12.t: "Abu Bakr Tihrani - a Persian Historian"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.12.d: "Abu Bakr Tihrani was a historian with his roots in the court of the Timurid Empire. With the downfall of the empire, he would switch his allegiance to the Qara Qoyunlu Sultanate and later would become the chief historian in the Aq Qoyunlu court. He is known for having produced the Kitab-i Diyarbakriyya, the only example of a work that described the history of Aq and Qara Qoyunlu in such detail."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.12.a: "Excellent!"
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.13.t: "Fazlallah Khunji Isfahani"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.13.d: "Fazlallah Khunji Isfahani was a religious scholar and a historian from Shiraz in Fars. Originally a part of the Aq Qoyunlu court, his patrons' court would succumb to the Safavids, who would start a procession of Shi'ification. As such, Fazlallah fled to Transoxiana, where he would find patronage in the court of the Timurid successors."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.13.a: "Give him a spot next to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.14.t: "A Prominent Sufi"
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.14.d: "Bitlis is home to a lesser-known Sufi Author known as Hosam al-Din Ali Bitlisi, father of the more prominent Idris Biltisi. Member of the Nurbakhshi order, he has gained fame in his local territory. He could serve us as well and instill piety in the courtiers of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.14.a: "Invite him to our court."
 ME_Aq_Qoyunlu_Events.14.b: "Let him stay at home."
