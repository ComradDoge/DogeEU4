 #Tamazagha Missions#

 tamaz_desert_backbone_title: "The Sea of Sand and Heat"
 tamaz_desert_backbone_desc: "Centuries have gone by and the Amazigh people have lived in the arid lands of the Sahara without end. Our ancestors saw the end of the Roman Empire and the surge of Islam sweep across the north; they also saw the rise and fall of the Fatimid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate of al-Andalus, and the Almohad Caliphate centered to the north of the Atlas Mountains. Witnessing this much history gives our people a plethora of knowledge to learn from, but without a stable connection to our scattered people across the vast desert wastes, we are a state subject to the whims of nature and foreigners. The time to fully unite the northern and southern Amazigh people in finally here, and this time there will be no power around to stop us."
 tamaz_sources_of_water_title: "For Water; For Safety"
 tamaz_sources_of_water_desc: "WWhat keeps several Amazigh people going? Other than strong cultural values and traditions, life needs food and water to continue on! Thus, how do we survive in the arid deserts north of the Sahel and south of Tunis? Oases! One such facet that has been key to our survival and to the success of trading caravans crossing the vast sands of the desert are these bodies of glorious water that we call oases. They are scattered throughout, of course, but there are enough of them that we can facilitate strong communities and develop wondrous settlements around them if given the opportunity. Since the Amazigh people are becoming more united thanks to our own efforts, it is only natural that we patronize the development of these oases!"
 tamaz_placate_the_confederacies_title: "Amazigh Confederacies"
 tamaz_placate_the_confederacies_desc: "From the Zenata to the Sanhaja, and from the Barghawatas to the Masmuda, Amazigh people have often organized themselves along the lines of confederacies wherein a few or many smaller tribes/groups of Amazigh people gather together to form some sort of loose alliance for the betterment of each other and the protection of their own land. These confederacies have traditionally held enormous influence across the lands Tamazgha now controls and it is true that the various confederacies gave birth to monumental states in our past, but that potential for greatness also means they can destabilize Tamazgha as a whole if they are not properly respected and utilized. It is our solemn duty, then, to ensure cooperation and service with the various confederacies, lest they become restless and idle in our own lands."
 tamaz_arid_cavalry_traditions_title: "Like a Sandstorm!"
 tamaz_arid_cavalry_traditions_desc: "We of the vast desert have used both camels and horses alike to aid our lives in both the utilitarian sense and the military sense. Camels are used for the hotter parts of our land whilst horses are used for the more humid areas, yet both can be used in conjunction with a strong infantry sector in the midst of battle. As Tamazgha cultivates itself in several ways ranging from its taxation system to its military organization, it would be wise to sift through the tactics and strategies brought forth by various Amazigh officers and officials on how to best utilize our horses and camels; the usage of cavalry in the Sahel is not the same as when cavalry is used in the Maghreb."
 tamaz_to_build_qanats_title: "Coupled with Qanats"
 tamaz_to_build_qanats_desc: "The oases we have developed around the land of Tamazgha are fantastic in the prosperity they bring, but there is a second facet of our historical culture that should be used to drive further development in our own arid land: qanats! These ingenious systems for transporting underground water to the surface for irrigation, sanitation, and to quench thirsts has been around for centuries and is still very much used by our people today, but so many are built without state funding. Subsidizing them officially and investing resources into making them more reliable for future generations will undoubtedly bolster the growth of our villages and towns even in the hottest parts of Tamazgha."
 tamaz_three_jewels_of_the_north_title: "Jewels of the North"
 tamaz_three_jewels_of_the_north_desc: "There are several mosques that have been built across the lands of Morocco and Tunis, but few are greater than those of the Kutubiyya Mosque, the Great Mosque of Tlemcen, and the Kasbah Mosque. They are pillars of the Islamic faith in their respective regions, yet all three are in danger of failing into disrepair if they are left to the whims of petty states fighting against each other, or possibly even invaders from beyond the northern coastline. Tamazgha can and should prove itself to be a true protector of these lands by upholding all three mosques through renovations and stalwart defenses."
 tamaz_three_bastions_of_the_south_title: "Bastions of the South"
 tamaz_three_bastions_of_the_south_desc: "Whilst we have done well to rebuild the pillars of Islam in the north, signaling to many that our power is not just temporary but rather it is here to stay, our cousins across the Sahara and Sahel are misguided and struggling to live independently. It is finally time that we take our cousins under our wing whether by force or by diplomacy, securing the traditional routes across the Sahara and anchoring ourselves within the Sahel itself. It will not be easy as there are several powerful states that will stop at nothing to see us driven out, but Tamazgha has dealt with far worse."
 tamaz_lured_by_golden_words_title: "Gold and White Words"
 tamaz_lured_by_golden_words_desc: "The old Malian Empire has faded from grace, lost to factionalism and regional powers taking control of things in the wake of a weakened administration. Though some parts may hold out in the hopes that they can revive the empire, we of Tamazgha must seek out that which is still closely guarded by the scions of old: gold and ivory. Following the trade routes and seizing control of the gold mines and ivory-rich areas will allow us to garner not only a serious economic boost, but also delve deeper into the heart of West Africa so that Tamazgha authority is more fully entrenched."
 tamaz_kanem_falls_title: "Wet Work"
 tamaz_kanem_falls_desc: "For a great amount of generations the people just east of the Hausa have battled over the rights to control the lake and all the trade that flows around it. Whether they were fighting amongst themselves or battling incoming raiding parties, they never did fully settle the feuds from previous generations so that a united state could function. Perhaps it would be best if the Amazigh taught these people what true peace is, especially since if they were to unite they could be a dangerous threat to our trade power and political influence."
 tamaz_mossi_messes_title: "Mossi Messes"
 tamaz_mossi_messes_desc: "With our grip on the Niger River secure, the Mossi people have broken free from the grips of the old Songhai Empire. Mossi people have had their own traditions and kingdoms for several centuries and even the Songhai Empire could not truly rein them in politically or religiously. Thus, Tamazgha must walk a fine line when it comes to dealing with the Mossi people and those south of the Niger River; they are fierce in spirit and ruthless in war, especially when using nature to their advantage."
 tamaz_take_advantage_or_take_them_in_title: "Answer the People"
 tamaz_take_advantage_or_take_them_in_desc: "We have taken great strides in conquering people of several different cultures, traditions, languages, and histories. Though Tamazgha grows with time in terms of influence, wealth, and overall power, the state itself cannot ignore the rising questions from people south of the Sahel and the Niger River. Though the Mossi are perhaps the largest manifestation of this form of questioning toward our administration, there are several other instances where we have yet to address what to do with newly conquered people. What rituals can they practice still? What system of governance is right for these various people? These questions and so many others are going to need to be answered."
 tamaz_western_monopoly_title: "By Money and Power"
 tamaz_western_monopoly_desc: "Tamazgha has come to encompass so much land in Africa as a whole that there are few to none that would call us a mere pawn on the world stage. Our holdings in West Africa, particularly those of the former Malian Empire and its former subjects, are becoming more integrated within Tamazgha with each passing day, but there are still loose ends to tie up. Ensuring that the gold mines are properly developed and that the ivory trade is unhindered by nomadic raiders or corrupt local leaders will be key to ensuring stability in the region as a whole."
 tamaz_eastern_monopoly_title: "By Cloth and Grain"
 tamaz_eastern_monopoly_desc: "The routes across the Sahara that are guarded by our own people and our cousins that are the Tuareg hold immense potential as we have seen. These routes have allowed Tamazgha to control vast stretches of West Africa but they alone cannot ensure our hold on the Sahel and beyond. In order to see Tamazgha's influence remain strong in places like Kanem, Katsina, and Zazzau, we will need to build up strong bases of infrasutructure like courthouses, workshops, temples, or even markets for traders. In doing so, we can garner more loyalty from the common people and prevent unrest from spreading."


 #Tir na Celtigh Missions#
 celtigh_professional_foundations_title: "Muskets & Sails"
 celtigh_professional_foundations_desc: "Eire (Irish for Ireland itself) is full of proud and stalwart families with storied histories that stretch back for generations without end, but it is only recently that we have seen them put down their weapons to unite beneath a common banner. To help dissolve these tense clan bonds that often stoke feuds between clans and families alike, we should be looking to incorporate the powerful lineages into our military and navy in more ways than one. If they can be tamed in some fashion, we can be sure that the entire state will have some of the finest fighters on both land and sea."
 celtigh_boat_building_title:  "With Cloth and Wood"
 celtigh_boat_building_desc: "Naturally positioned toward the Atlantic Ocean and toward the rest of the Isles, Eire is ripe for building ships in its various ports and docks. Too often the defenders of Eire have been lacking in naval strength meaning that invaders came ashore and did battle with whoever they wanted; it is time we stop this from ever happening again."
 celtigh_recruitment_centers_title: "With Speech and Stone"
 celtigh_recruitment_centers_desc: "Though Eire is fertile ground for our growing state, it lacks the growing urbanization that we see happening elsewhere in Europe. Places like Rome, Vienna, and Paris all have strong foundations for a more professional military thanks to their rising cities, but Eire lacks in this particular area unfortunately. That does not mean, however, that strong recruits cannot be found. If we actively reach out to the more spread out and rural communities of Eire through new stone barracks, fortifications, and military camps, we will be entice recruits slowly but surely as we begin to work with rural people."
 celtigh_east_north_america_settlers_title: "Broaden our Horizon"
 celtigh_east_north_america_settlers_desc: "For too long the people of Eire have been jostled around by foreign powers, battling for supremacy against the English and Scandinavians for countless generations. Through tireless efforts from our own rulers and officials, a state capable of keeping all of Eire's interest at heart is alive and well but should this state remain in Europe alone? Are there not lands beyond the auspices of the Atlantic Ocean that those of Iberia and elsewhere talk of? The only way to find out is to sponsor our own hardy sailors from Eire to investigate the matter in earnest. If they it turns out to be true, a whole new world of possibilities opens up for all Celtic people!"
 celtigh_irish_terms_and_conditions_title: "People, Land, and Rights"
 celtigh_irish_terms_and_conditions_desc: "Though humble in our roots, we know all too well that the people of Eire are tough in more ways than one and also fiercly independent. In order to ensure compliance with our own laws and regulations, we should be working toward integrating the people of Eire within the state as a whole through public works projects alongside mediating the disputes between various local families and clans."
 celtigh_irish_court_systems_title: "No Blood, Only Ink"
 celtigh_irish_court_systems_desc: "Our efforts to integrate the lands of Eire into the entirety of our state has gone well so far, though we cannot hope to get every single local dispute resolved with courtiers and officials. We must set up a strong judicial base in Eire through courts that all can go to should they have an issue to resolve. Whether it's land rights, theft, murder, or any other crime that must be brought up, these court systems will help streamline our local administration."
 celtigh_how_big_of_an_irish_sector_title: "Standards of the Army"
 celtigh_how_big_of_an_irish_sector_desc: "Our growth in both administrative areas and military strength has meant that our old feudal levies are becoming obselete. Slowly replacing feudal levies with a military paid by the state and disciplined through actual training methods drawn up by officers is not cheap in the slightest, and giving a basic education to various people of Eire and elsewhere has caused various ideas to spring up on how to organize the military as a whole. Let us hear them so that we can sketch out a more concrete future for up-and-coming soldiers."
 celtigh_bringing_crops_back_title: "The Humble Potato"
 celtigh_bringing_crops_back_desc: "As our colonies in the New World grow more prosperous, we are seeing that trade with the native people is increasing too. There are several incidents wherein our colonies are starting to grow crops they traded for from the natives and even now farmers in our homeland are starting to take up the practice. Particularly in Eire, growing 'potatoes', as this one interesting tuber is called, is becoming a regularity that no one bats an eye at. Perhaps we could integrate this new crop into our regular fields of wheat and barely? Perhaps the rest of our people would enjoy it in their own diets."
 celtigh_warmer_lands_title: "Rain Rain Go Away"
 celtigh_warmer_lands_desc: "Though the lands of the north in the New World are valuable for fishing and lumber, many families that wish to depart for opportunities in the New World state that they refuse to settle in these colder areas because they can barely farm or raise cattle for grazing. They are suggesting that our officials look further south to warmer coasts where rain is not nearly as constant and the land can be tilled for future usage regularly. Dare we take up the words of mere farmers and peasants like this?"
 celtigh_domination_over_the_cold_lands_title: "Through Snow and Ice"
 celtigh_domination_over_the_cold_lands_desc: "Intrepid explorers have taken up the task of helping our people chart out the New World, but not all make it back unfortuantely. Their legacy to us is that we settle what they have mapped out and in particular some rough-and-ready families from Eire have signed on as willing land owners if they can get supplied by us in regular intervals. We are risking some of the most valued families in Eire for this, but the end result could be worth the effort if all goes according to plan."
 celtigh_atlantic_fleet_title: "Homes on the Water"
 celtigh_atlantic_fleet_desc: "The English had a mighty fleet before we came through and cleaned the entire region of their independent political presence. Since there is no English fleet anymore, the French navy as well as the Portuguese and Spanish navies are gearing up for dominance over the Atlantic Ocean in spite of us. Let us put those docks and shipyards to good use finally, we cannot let our rivals keep us from Atlantic trade routes nor European coastlines!"
 celtigh_channel_domination_title: "It's Worth Every Coin"
 celtigh_channel_domination_desc: "The sea traffic that goes through the Channel nowadays is truly staggering as traders of every kind of origin in Europe are seen passing through. This does mean that the competition between various states for influence in the Channel itself is fierce. The French, the Dutch, the Scandinavians even! All of them want a cut of the profits for themselves, yet we have the power to stop them! With the power of our illustrious navy at our back thanks in part to the shipyards of Eire, we will secure all the Channel has to offer!"
 celtigh_scottish_clan_meetings_title: "Old Clans; New Oaths"
 celtigh_scottish_clan_meetings_desc: "With histories as old as the very stones used to make the castles they reside in for power and influence, the various clans of Alba (Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland) are not to be underestimated. The ferocious fighters they can raise up for or against our nation means that it would be wise of use to consolidate the lands they inhabit. Once we can come to terms with the largest of the clans, we can garner a solid network of local control in the region and expand our influence from there."
 celtigh_legacy_of_the_lordship_title: "Hot Waters"
 celtigh_legacy_of_the_lordship_desc: "Despite the Kalmar Union in the east meaning that Norwegian holdings are becoming less and less realistic out in the North Sea, the Norwegian nobility still seek to work with the Danish authorities to wrest control over the lands of Alba. Let us do what we must and contest the Norwegians and Danish at all points as we enforce our own claims to the islands and coasts of the North Sea."
 celtigh_answer_the_reformation_title: "Decipher the Divinity"
 celtigh_answer_the_reformation_desc: "The Catholic Church has been fractured thanks to the works of Martin Luther opening the flood gates of the Protestant Reformation. Villages and towns across our nation are swamped by factionalism on a level we have never before seen, yet we are not without hope in these bleak times. Whether we choose to use diplomatic compromises or brute force to calm the religious tensions in our land, we will see the end of this turbulent era. They say that the divine works in mysterious ways, violent ones even, but we shall come out stronger at the end of it all!"
 CELTIGH_SCOTTISH_MERCENARIES_GATHER: "Completing this mission will enable the 'Highlanders of Alba' Mercenary Company, who are specialized in dealing §Yfire and shock damage§!."
 merc_fe_gaels_of_highlands: "Highlanders of Alba"
 celtigh_light_or_heavy_infantry_title: "Direct or Indirect"
 celtigh_light_or_heavy_infantry_desc: "The state we are cultivating has to have a powerful military overall, but military technology has changed over the generations. Gone are the days where our highland brothers and sisters would brave the field of battle with sheer tenacity and wills forged through skill and prowess; a shot from a musket or cannon can smite them down before they even let out a battle cry. So, we must ask ourselves: Do we still need a central infantry core that is heavily armored for pitched battles or should we shift our focus to skirmishing and light warfare tactics?"
 celtigh_the_north_sea_conquests_title: "Like Crashing Waves"
 celtigh_the_north_sea_conquests_desc: "Our efforts to force back the Scandinavians has been met with success so far, but that doesn't mean they are out of the fight yet. Their control over valuable North Sea ports in places like Akershus means that they can still put pressure on our traders for deals both big and small. It is time we end this matter once and for all by seizing these ports for ourselves and ensuring that the Scandinavian authorities cannot beat us back."
 celtigh_monopoly_over_the_north_sea_title: "Invest in Progress"
 celtigh_monopoly_over_the_north_sea_desc: "Our grip over the North Sea tightens with every passing month since the conquests of both the valuable islands and ports, but we cannot just sit on our ships and rely solely on military garrisons for profit. We must actually build up economic structures and allow the commoners to do what they do best: spend money, invest time and wealth, and help push forth our nation in the direction of economic growth."
 celtigh_reach_the_ice_barrier_title: "The Ice Barrier"
 celtigh_reach_the_ice_barrier_desc: "Far to the north lies Iceland, a small but notable holdout of Scandinavian influence that also has its own part in trade across the North sea. Though it is quite out of the way in terms of our goals for the North Sea, Iceland might very well remain a bastion of Norwegian, Danish, or possibly even an independent Icelandic nobility that seeks to be a thorn in the side of us Celts. It would be better if we stop these upstarts in Iceland before things get out of hand; send those ships and soldiers north at once!"
 celtigh_solidify_the_right_to_rule_title: "Choose a Catechism"
 celtigh_solidify_the_right_to_rule_desc: "From shore to shore in our lands, there are religious communities that are uncertain of the future. Do we need cardinals for our administration? Do we still have bishops around? Does the local clergy believe what we believe? All these questions and more are rising to the surface with answers varying from area to area. We must take a stand sooner rather than later, and get a firm grip on these religious fractures within our land so that we can go forward with stability instead of unrest; the time to deepen our roots in whatever faith we have chosen is now."
 celtigh_lead_the_pious_folks_title: "Prosperous and Pious"
 celtigh_lead_the_pious_folks_desc: "Thre are various views on how the clergy and the administration should treat the numerous amounts of heretics scattered throughout Europe. Some would have them burned; others would have them exiled; still other groups would see them either tortured or praised for their decisions. Let us step away from the most radical groups but rather, take a gander at what the groups closer to the center have to say. Can we perpetuate a tolerant state of affairs? Are we driven like zealots for a religious cause? Maybe there are other options for us too, we need only look for them."
 celtigh_move_southward_title: "The Clans Ask"
 celtigh_move_southward_desc: "Our efforts to meet with the various clans to know what they desire and what they are willing to compromise on has been met with success so far, but their demands are becoming more and more intrusive to others within our realm. What they are looking for is new land to build bases of power in both in terms of agriculture and up-and-coming industries, yet they say time and time again that the lands of the north are not fit for widespread communities that are undergo regular growth. The solution? Taking lands from the English in the south, that is what they propose! We can ignore such requests from the clans for now, but their offer is somewhat enticing to our administration."
 celtigh_prosperous_clans_title: "Shifting the Demographics"
 celtigh_prosperous_clans_desc: "Whilst we thought that the clans from Dun Phris (Dumfries) to Obar Dheathain (Aberdeen) would be satisfied with settling in the lands of Cumrbia and Northumberland, it is clear to us that those early years were just the precursor to even more families moving southward! Whilst it is not a flood of families streaming southward, there are significant portions of the northern populations that are moving south in order to set up shop in places like York, Lancashire, and Sheffield. The English populations certainly won't appreciate the incoming settlers, but perhaps these clans could be productive in their new homes if we give them enough time."
 CELTIGH_ENGLISH_RIOTS_DUE_TO_EXPULSION: "Selecting this option will enrage the English population of the Isles due to being completely disenfranchised by our administration! §RAll provinces of English culture in the region of the Isles will gain 10 base unrest!§"
 celtigh_the_warm_gulf_title: "The Gulf Competition"
 celtigh_the_warm_gulf_desc: "The more we hear about these lands across the Alantic Ocean, the more our people want to go out and explore them for a variety of reasons. Though some would prefer the colder climates for exploration and settlements, the clans of Alba have eyed up the southern island chains more due to the fact they're easier to thrive in. It won't be easy getting a foothold in these island chains if other Europeans are setting up colonies as well, so let's get those colonial vessels ready!"
 celtigh_gulf_operations_title: "Par for the Course!"
 celtigh_gulf_operations_desc: "Much to our delight, the colonies set up so far in the warm gulf of the south are thriving! They are building strong settlements that can hold down local areas and cultivate new crops, but the danger of other European states is always present in these inviting waters. With others already setting up colonial settlements in nearby areas compared to our own colonies, it is only natural that we should try to expand our bases of operation in the Caribbean!"
 celtigh_welcome_to_the_jungle_north_title: "Blood-Soaked Wealth"
 celtigh_welcome_to_the_jungle_north_desc: "With the harbors and towns slowly growing throughout the Caribbean, the colonial petitions coming through to us state that there is more wealth and opportunity to be had in the coasts just west of our Caribbean colonies. Despite these tempting prospects, word has it that these petty native states are ferocious in their ability to fight in the tropical jungles and arid drylands they call home. If we are to take these petitions up, we should make sure our military can handle such dangerous circumstances."
 celtigh_welcome_to_the_jungle_south_title: "Welcome to the Jungle"
 celtigh_welcome_to_the_jungle_south_desc: "South of our Caribbean colonies are yet more jungles of course, but the native states in the south are far less organized and capable of fighting back. This is an inviting opportunity to the settlers already present in the Caribbean, but we must not rush into the jungle without precautions like proper exploration and capable military regiments. If a few colonies fail to grow and end up dying out, it will be wasted money and resources that we could have used elsewhere."
 celtigh_revive_the_manx_title: "On Your Feet, Mannin!"
 celtigh_revive_the_manx_desc: "Mannin (what the island is called in Gaelg/Manx Gaelic) has been home to a variety of conflicts between Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and various Gaelic figures throughout history since it is a central island for the entirety of the region. To control Mannin is to help strengthen control over trade and politics as a whole and since we have secured it for a united Celtic state, we should begin to build it up. Weavers, sailors, stonemasons, traders, and clergy alike will all help strengthen Mannin into a bastion of ny Manninee (Manx) people!"
 celtigh_revive_cornwall_title: "The Foolish Burial"
 celtigh_revive_cornwall_desc: "The last recorded king of Kernow (Cornwall) was Donyarth/Dungarth who died in 875. Once he was dead, those of Kernow were thoroughly under the grip of the Kingdom of Wessex. Though after the Norman invasion things did change and the Stannary Parliament system was established to govern tin mining amongst the Kernowyon (Cornish people), overall autonomy and independence was a dream that conclusively buried... Or so they thought! With a unified Celtic state now governing the lands of Kernow, we can let Kernewwek (Cornish language) survive, but we can also revive the power of the Kernowyon; it is time to dig up the grave they tried to bury our fellow Celtic culture in."
 celtigh_trade_center_man_title: "Life in this Body Yet"
 celtigh_trade_center_man_desc: "Fortified and with a shipyard at the ready, Mannin is ready for greater heights! But in order to do so, we must attract people to come to the island and do commerce throughout its various streets and buildings. Thus, our next goal is clear: bolster the mercantile aspect of Mannin and work toward connecting it (through trade) to nearby trade ports."
 celtigh_beyond_fishing_title: "Tradition or Change?"
 celtigh_beyond_fishing_desc: "With the Manninee people more prosperous than they have ever been in the past, intellectuals hailing from Mannin itself are slowly making themselves known within our courts. As we concentrate our efforts toward even more infrastructure upgrades across our realm but especially in Mannin itself, we should look into what these intellectuals from Mannin have to say; they are far more than just fishermen and sailors that can barely read."
 celtigh_ports_down_south_title: "Knowledge of Kernow"
 celtigh_ports_down_south_desc: "Kernow may seem to be cornered within the Isles itself, but being in a small section of the region does not mean they are without possiblities and potential. Utilizing the traditions of the Kernowyon, we can cultivate a very strong naval sector in the lands of Kernow itself through the usage of shipyars and naval supplies from other parts of our state."
 celtigh_upcoming_industry_title: "Mineral Potential"
 celtigh_upcoming_industry_desc: "Mining for minerals and ores is nothing new to those of Kernow since tin mining has been around since before the Normans invaded. Ever since then, the wealth that was extracted from the mines were not given toward those Kernow or those of Cymru, but rather they were used by Anglo-Saxon or Norman overlords instead. Since we have worked to build up the homeland of the Kernowyon, these mines have been coming to life once more and there are even folks who are willing to sponsor new digs across Kernow to see if new veins of ores can be found. Maybe we can usher in a new age of earthen wealth for the Kernowyon?"
 celtigh_prepare_to_pirate_title: "Honor is Relative"
 celtigh_prepare_to_pirate_desc: "There are those that would think our up-and-coming fleet and sailors are a bunch of misguided fishermen and ex-soldiers, but things could not be further from the truth! Most of our hardy admirals and stalwart sailors are men of honor and dignity that sail with pride beneath our flag, but we cannot deny that like very other naval force, we too have a section of less than desirable seamen. Not bound by the usual forces of societal shame and self-worth, perhaps these rougher individuals can be directed toward a more contentious task if we give them the right vessels... A task that our rivals will be most displeased with..."
 celtigh_pirates_of_cornwall_title: "Misguided by Force"
 celtigh_pirates_of_cornwall_desc: "With the set of less-than-honorable sailors ready to privateer with our own discretion and backing, we should look toward the south so that they can engage in profitable endeavors through lucrative trade routes. Off the coasts of Bordeaux, Asturias, Porto, and Seville are where they can find the most profits if they have what it takes; treasures both large and small flow through these areas without end as it is."
 celtigh_the_atlantic_is_ours_title: "Basis for Domination"
 celtigh_the_atlantic_is_ours_desc: "With our piracy bringing in a plethora of profits and exports from Mannin being imported into foreign markets finally, we must look toward the notion of rival states seeking to cull our fleet size and trade power. Whether the enemy hails from Madrid, Toledo, Paris, Lisbon, or somewhere else in Western Europe, we must secure a grip on the Alantic Ocean as a whole so as to keep them at bay. If they cannot beat our fleets and admirals on the water, then we will be able to use the vast oceanic trade routes to ferry resources wherever we need to when war breaks out."
 celtigh_exports_to_western_europe_title: "Export No Matter What!"
 celtigh_exports_to_western_europe_desc: "With our internal trade routes expanding and flourishing with each passing month and year, those of Mannin are looking to increase their exports to foreign markets. The closest markets being that of French and Iberian cities means that the exports would be going to them, yet the crowns within both regions are keenly aware of the balance of trade at play; they will not just buy so many products and go into debt. Thus, we must find a way around the authority of the foreign royals and nobles so that the products of Mannin can be sold and we can see ever increasing trade profits, and if this means we have to work with some privateers, then so be it."
 celtigh_knowledge_to_the_welsh_title: "Knowing of Cymru"
 celtigh_knowledge_to_the_welsh_desc: "The English sought to curtail any ambitions for independence by the Cymry (Welsh term for Welsh people) and they were successful for the most part, but the independent cultural identity remains despite attempts by the English to integrate various sections of Cymru (Welsh term for 'Wales') throughout the 1400s and onward. Now that the Cymry are much more free to do as they please and with a government ready to work with them and their storied past, let us take the time to learn about the people of Cymru and what they need in terms of equipment, funding, and resources."
 celtigh_stand_up_and_fight_title: "Fighting for Cymru"
 celtigh_stand_up_and_fight_desc: "The last great attempt of the Cymry to regain some sort of independence from the English was in the early 1400s when Owain Glyndwr waged a long war of rebellion against Henry IV and V. Though the first part of the rebellion was met with success, the momentum died out after a few years and French support was nowhere to be found, leading to an eventual fracturing in the face of hardened English opposition. This noble stand by those of Cymru under Owain Glyndwr and previous revolts against the English as well in order to preserve the independence of Cymru is not lost on us, the unified Celtic state, for it is partially in the memory of these desperate gasps for independent life that we build our military with stalwart Cymry soldiers integrated within."
 celtigh_beyond_the_dyke_title: "Off with Offa's Dyke!"
 celtigh_beyond_the_dyke_desc: "Established by the Anglo-Saxon king of Mercia named Offa, the old dyke stood approximately 8ft. (2.4m) tall and went through hills and dips alike. Its purpose was to mark the boundary between Mercia and Cymry kingdom of Powys at the time though it was used afterwards by the Normans: Hugh d'Avranches as Earl of Chester, Roger de Montgomerie as Earl of Shrewsbury, and William FitzOsbern as Earl of Hereford. Such 'marcher lords' were tasked with subduing the Cymry people and maintaining the border that usually ran along the Offa's Dyke, but such efforts were in vain.\nIt is time we shatter this age-old barrier between the lands of the Cymry and English, is it not? The Cymry deserve to know that such a line in the dirt from ages ago will not contain their ambitions any longer!"
 celtigh_demographics_in_wales_title: "Shift, Move, Rise"
 celtigh_demographics_in_wales_desc: "Without a doubt one of the consistent factors in the development of Cymru that we are trying to keep track of is the economic growth it is experiencing. Our efforts to know the people of Cymru and the layout of its towns and villages has led to an immense amount of knowledge pouring into our archives, but what good is this knowledge if we do not act on it through some sort of legislation? Surely the growing communities all around Cymru cannot go on producing whatever it is they want without much supervision, can they? Or is there perhaps some wisdom in watching them grow from afar?"
 celtigh_dealing_with_the_english_title: "Perfidious Albion?"
 celtigh_dealing_with_the_english_desc: "The Kingdom of England has had a tumultuous history with Cymru and its people, that much is known to the general public, but just how bad the laws against the Cymry is not as well known. On top of building castles to instill English authority throughout the lands of Cymru after the Glyndwr Rising, the plantation boroughs that sprung up by the new castles were there to help settle the land with English people. Even intermarriage was outlawed through the 'Penal Laws against Wales' which was passed in 1402 during the uprising. Thus we are left with questions raised and so far left unanswered: Can we trust the English once more? How can we know of the intentions of various English towns and cities? One way to find out is to investigate for ourselves."
 celtigh_rulings_on_the_english_title: "Reversal of Fate?"
 celtigh_rulings_on_the_english_desc: "With our investigations into the various English communities under our authority more or less complete by now, we are seeing varying results depending on which community we look at. This is to be expected just like how various educated English individuals are trying to 'smooth relations' between the Celtic peoples and the English people by entering our administration. What are we to do with these results though? There are several groups within our court that offer up suggestions as to what the fate of the English should be, regardless of the will of the English themselves..."
 celtigh_a_source_for_european_markets_title: "Islands of Interest"
 celtigh_a_source_for_european_markets_desc: "The fall of the English from their lofty place of power has meant that European markets restructured themselves somewhat to adjust to the reality of a new state taking hold in the region. We too are in the middle of adjusting since we are trying to come to terms with competing against French, Dutch, Danish, and even German merchants for good deals and secure trade routes. One way we can bolster our influence with regards to trade influence is by producing more than our rivals so that our products simply outnumber the rest by a fair margin. It won't be an easy task getting that much tar, cod, and wool on the market, but it's something that is already in progress."
 celtigh_leading_european_markets_title: "Trading with Trust"
 celtigh_leading_european_markets_desc: "Since we have bolstered our trade position within Europe itself, more and more states are seeing our merchants as legitimate sellers and buyers who can deliver on previous agreements. The next step is to try to monopolize these markets somehow, whether it is in the realm of wool and the materials that use wool or something else we have a strong basis for producing in large quantities. If we can monopolize any single market in and around Europe, the rewards will be monumental and we will be able to use our growing trade influence to help aid our efforts in any number of ways."
 celtigh_age_of_coal_title: "Creativity from Coal"
 celtigh_age_of_coal_desc: "The machines being produced nowadays are far more advanced than the machines we had in the 1400s and 1500s in a variety of ways, yet some of the most interesting machines today are being made to run off something different: Steam! Engines to power various tools on farms, in warehouses, in armories, in foundries, and even in mines underground are starting to use steam more and more, and helps power these steam engines you may ask? Why, it is coal of course! We have known of coal for ages now and people have used it here and there throughout our recorded history, but the machines that run off of steam are utilizing so much more coal that mines are now digging for the black material alongside regular ores. Might we say we are about to enter a new age?"
 celtigh_men_at_arms_title: "Recruits from Peasantry"
 celtigh_men_at_arms_desc: "The land of the Cymry is nowhere near as ready for bustling towns and cities like the lower lying lands of the English. The hills and highlands that the Cymry call home are filled with scattered villages and towns that do not make for a strong base for disciplined infantry to be recruited from, yet they are devout in their cause to preserve their rights to the land they live on. Such devotion has been seen time and time again when the English were attempting to enforce their authority over Cymru as a whole, and it is such devotion that we will call upon as we build up or military with a strong backbone of infantry."
 celtigh_status_of_archery_title: "Broken Arrows?"
 celtigh_status_of_archery_desc: "It was during the 1300s and early to mid-1400s that the longbowmen of Cymru began to stand out as key pieces of English armies being led against France, or even when the Cymry rose up in revolt against the English themselves. Such a fearsome reputation does not come without its training beforehand, however, and it takes a lifetime to shoot a longbow for a sustained amount of time in the middle of battle or even just to hunt with it for a fair amount of time. Even though it is falling out of favor more and more due to muskets and crossbows, is there still a place for this practice of archery in general amongst the ranks of our peasants and soldiers?"
 celtigh_united_breton_labor_title: "Our Work is Never Over"
 celtigh_united_breton_labor_desc: "The 100 Years' War left terrible scars upon the people of England and France, yet those on the sidelines also suffered greatly because of these two states feuding over ancestral claims: the Burgundians in the east and the Bretoned in the west. Whilst Burgundy and its disjointed lands came out from the conflict in a stronger state compared to Breizh, the people of Breizh did not have to deal with the machinations of foreigners on all sides. In order to help the Bretoned recover from the devastation the 100 Years' War, we should engage in infrastructure developments on the community and village level before building up to the town and city level. We cannot know the true woes of the Bretoned if we only ever see and hear from the upper echelons of Breizh as a whole."
 celtigh_pious_bretons_title: "Solace after the Schism"
 celtigh_pious_bretons_desc: "It may seem like a distant memory to some, but to the clergy of Breizh (Breton term for Brittany itself), the rift in the Papacy was nothing short of earth-shattering. Though the Eastern Orthodox states split off centuries before, it was not as clear as to when and how the schism came about to the more local clergy outside of the Italian Peninsula. The split of 1378 to about 1429 though? That was known to several rulers both near Breizh and far away, causing sides to be taken and politics to shift around. The Bretoned clergy (Breton term for Breton people) are thus in the recovery phase still from this tumultuous religious period, though with enough support from our administration, they can be propped up again to remain integral to their various communities."
 celtigh_bretons_at_arms_title: "By the Ermine Plain!"
 celtigh_bretons_at_arms_desc: "The efforts to rebuild the infrastructure both physically and spiritually has gone very well in Breizh so far, yet the last piece of the puzzle remains covered by weeds and dirt. It is now time that we brush off and clean up the old standard adopted by John III of Breizh, the so-called 'ermine plain'. His distinctive coat of arms is what many aspiring soldiers of Breizh look up to in the face of continual French threats, and it is by this coat of arms that the people of Breizh will know courage when they go toe-to-toe against those of the fleur-de-lis."
 celtigh_conquer_the_valley_title: "Charge the Chateaus!"
 celtigh_conquer_the_valley_desc: "The Loire River is what flows through Naoned (Breton for Nantes) and provides a plethora of water and transport for those that need it, yet it also serves as a natural barrier in some cases. The river is a natural path of conquest for the Bretoned and we shall follow it further into what is traditionally seen as as the 'Garden of France', the Loire Valley. The marvelous chateaus here house immense wealth and prestige thanks to the varying styles found throughout, yet they also serve to uphold the authority of the French as a whole along the Loire River itself. The time has come to charge forth in the name of the Bretoned to usurp these positions of power from the vile French!"
 celtigh_conquer_poitou_title: "Southern Strategy"
 celtigh_conquer_poitou_desc: "Whilst the French nobles are being reined in through efforts in the capital of Paris, there are still some areas of the French state that are rather high in autonomy and lacking in direct supervision from the authorities in Paris. One such place is in the south toward the region of Occitania, a traditional region of contention for the French as a whole due to the cultural and linguistic differences. If we can secure a strong foothold just south of Naoned, then we will be able to lay out even larger plans for the rest of Occitania."
 celtigh_conquer_normandy_title: "Shores of Normandy"
 celtigh_conquer_normandy_desc: "A key part of trade routes that flow through the Channel is that of the coasts of Normandy. They are vast in sheer area and can be developed further into docks or ports for a fleet of ships, yet the French nor the English were able to develop the area of Normandy due to the consistent conflict waged within its confines. Securing Normandy for ourselves will greatly secure our trade power in the Channel itself and allow us to directly threaten the heart of France itself: Ile-de-France."
 celtigh_conquer_orleans_title:  "Against the Current"
 celtigh_conquer_orleans_desc: "French power has been curbed to some degree thanks to the loss of most to all of their precious garden, yet their grip on power remains firm in several parts of the region. Bretoned soldiers and commanders alike speculate that them still holding more than half of the Loire River is what is helping keep the French administration afloat, thus leading to the conclusion that we must continue conquering land along its banks."
 celtigh_the_blue_crown_title: "The Blue Crown"
 celtigh_the_blue_crown_desc: "Bretoned supporters are rallying more and more to the banners of our unified Celtic state in the face of our seizure of Normandy; they can feel the momentum building for our side, and the pressure that is mounting on the French authorities in Paris. We will soon strike a fatal blow at the heart of the French monarchy itself through the capture and annexation of Paris; it will be like piercing the heart of the French state with a calculated thrust of a rapier. Though remnants of a French state may exist after the Bretoned soldiers capture the jewel within the French state's crown, we can be sure that it will be nothing more than a fragment of its former self."
 celtigh_breton_musketeers_title: "Musketeers of Breizh"
 celtigh_breton_musketeers_desc: "Experience is often learned in the heat of the moment and through doing various actions, not just simply talking about situations that could come about. This is what has become very apparent to the likes of hundreds to thousands of Breizh soldiers over the past years of conquest and conflict against the French. Taking over Paris and the Loire Valley through various battles and sieges has meant that Bretoned as well as other Celtic commanders are tossing around ideas as to how the infantry sector should be structured."
 celtigh_conquer_guyenne_title: "Grasp Guyenne"
 celtigh_conquer_guyenne_desc: "Initial success in pushing south means that the French are slowly getting weaker, but they still have enough power to put up a ferocious fight. In spite of the French will to hold us back, we must keep working to chip away at French power in the south as much as we possibly can! If we can take over Guyenne and set up a solid basis for our authority there, all of the south will be in danger of being taken away from France itself."
 celtigh_conquer_occitania_title: "Orderly Occitania"
 celtigh_conquer_occitania_desc: "The region of Occitania has been a traditional land of 'others' ot the Frankish people in the north, yet this never stopped those in Paris from imposing their will upon the petty leaders of Occitania time and time again. With our annexation of Poitou and Guyenne though, we have instilled some sort of hope to the people of Occitania that there is a different state that could give them a better life under a better government. Should we be able to take over places like Gascony and Languedoc and ensure that no French authority remains in these places, we may indeed get a great deal of support from the people of Occitania as a whole."
 celtigh_conquer_the_last_nobles_title: "Finish the Fight"
 celtigh_conquer_the_last_nobles_desc: "Paris has fallen; Normandy is ours; even the likes of the Channel itself is no longer seen as being divided up between various powers. And yet, there are still noble families of France that staunchly support the French monarchy despite the deathly blows we have dealt out. The time has come to eliminate their last northern retreats and bastions in both Champagna and Picardy, lest we want a lingering independent French presence that could ignite unrest within our land across the region."
 celtigh_conquer_the_last_of_the_river_title: "Headwaters of the Loire"
 celtigh_conquer_the_last_of_the_river_desc: "The cracks in the blue crown are showing, but still it clings to power through corrupt and legitimate means. The loss of more than half of the Loire River has given us hope that the finances of the French will stagnate or start to crumble, but we cannot wait forever for this to happen when the opportunity to take the rest of the Loire River is at hand. It will mean that we must enter the traditional land of the Burgundians, but if it means we can eliminate any sort of French resurgence, then we will take whatever risks are necessary."
 celtigh_fortify_the_loire_title: "The Line in the Dirt"
 celtigh_fortify_the_loire_desc: "We have focused a great deal on the Loire River and it is for good reason, yet the land it runs through is often undefended in terms of fortifications and military outposts. We have even taken advantage of this lack of defenses by marching our own troops alongside the river to French areas that were dearly lacking in protection, but are we going to fall into this same state of mind for the river? No, we must do the opposite instead! Redoubts, outposts, castles, whatever it takes to secure the Loire River in our favor not only in regards to politics but in terms of military potential as well!"
 WALLS_OF_THE_LOIRE: "Through fortifying the Loire River with several fortifications, the defensive nature of it will be bolstered and the military potential of the land alongside the river will be improved. §GThis mission reward will give all provinces identified within upgrades to local defensiveness, maximum hostile attrition, local movement speed, and also hinder the movement of enemy armies through the afformentioned provinces.§!"
 WALLS_OF_THE_LOIRE_TRIGGER: "Each highlighted province must have at least §T20 total development§! and one of the following fortifications: §Y Bastion, a Star Fort, or a Fortress.§!"
