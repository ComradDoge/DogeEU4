A soldier that has to go home to tend his fields is not one that will regularly exercise with his weapon.\n\nWhile we cannot change our entire army structure in one stroke we can ensure that a core of highly trained salaried troops specialize in these weapons.§!"

Let us create a standard uniform for all troops on our payrolls that we then attempt to provide for our troops.§!"
