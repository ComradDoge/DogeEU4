 GME_Pilgrimage_Events.100.D: "Built in Romanesque style between 1087, the date of the donation of Ruggero Borsa to the bishop Ursone of the court of the cathepan (on which the current basilica stands, and 1197, during the Norman domination. The construction of the basilica is linked to the relics of St. Nicholas, stolen, at least for the most substantial part, by sixty-two Bari sailors from the city of Myra, in Lycia, and arrived in Bari on 9 May 1087. The relics were temporarily housed in the monastery of San Benedetto run by the abbot Elia, who immediately promoted the construction of a new large church to house them. The area that until a few years earlier had hosted the palace of the Byzantine catapano (governor), destroyed during the rebellion for communal freedoms and which Roberto il Guiscardo had donated the year before to Archbishop Ursone; the works were started in July of the same year. On 1 October 1089 the relics were transferred to the crypt of the basilica by Pope Urban II who arrived specifically in Bari. The construction of the basilica, the result of at least three successive phases, was completed in 1197, the year in which a parchment that speaks of the Basilica already "constructa" dates back. The consecration plaque of 1197 that some interpret as the end of the work was a devotional act of the emperor Henry VI who, in memory of his father Federico Barbarossa, left for the Crusade asking for the blessing of St. Nicholas."

 GME_Pilgrimage_Events.104.T: "Processione di San Nicola"
 GME_Pilgrimage_Events.104.D: "He was probably born in Pàtara, a Greek city in Lycia, around 270 AD. There is no data on his childhood. Those that are often read in his lives, such as the name of his parents Epiphanius and Grandmother, or his standing in prayer as a newborn, refer to the life of a monk Nicholas who lived between 500 and 564 in the same region and who was bishop of Pinara. \nHe later left his hometown and moved to Myra (now Demre), a city located in Lycia, a province of the Byzantine Empire, which is located in present-day Turkey; there he was ordained a priest. On the death of the metropolitan bishop of Myra, he was acclaimed by the people as the new bishop. Imprisoned and exiled in 305 during the persecution of Diocletian, he was then freed by Constantine in 313 and resumed his apostolic activity. \nIt is not certain that he was one of the 318 participants in the Council of Nicaea in 325: according to tradition, however, during the council he would have harshly condemned Arianism, defending orthodoxy, and in a moment of impetus he would have slapped Arius. . The writings of Andrew of Crete and John Damascene would confirm his faith rooted in the principles of Catholic orthodoxy. He obtained supplies during a famine in Myra and the reduction of taxes from the Emperor. \nHe died in Myra on December 6, presumably in the year 343. \n\nAfter the death of St. Nicholas, the relics remain until 1087 in the Cathedral of Myra. \nThen, when Myra was besieged by the Muslims, the cities of Venice and Bari compete to take the saint's relics and take them to the West. Sixty-two sailors from Bari organize a maritime expedition, they manage to steal the bones of St. Nicholas, arriving with them in their city on May 9, 1087. Here they were temporarily entrusted to a Benedictine monastery and later transferred to the crypt of a new church dedicated to the saint, the Basilica of San Nicola, which at that time (1 October 1089) was not yet completed; it was Pope Urban II himself who presided over the solemn ceremony."

 GME_Pilgrimage_Events.199.T: "Pilgrimage Ended"
 GME_Pilgrimage_Events.199.D: "The first translation of the relics was carried out by 66 sailors from Bari, including the priests Lupo and Grimoldo, who left with three ships owned by the shipowners Dottula, who reached Myra recovering the relics of Nicholas, who arrived in Bari on 9 May 1087. Second the legend, the relics were deposited where the oxen pulling the load from the boat stopped. Some columns of the temple then followed the ship of the Bari sailors to Bari. It was actually the Benedictine church (today the church of San Michele Arcangelo) under the custody of the abbot Elia, who would later become bishop of Bari. However, the abbot promoted the construction of a new church dedicated to the saint, which was consecrated two years later by Pope Urban II on the occasion of the definitive placement of the relics under the altar of the crypt. Since then, St. Nicholas became co-patron of Bari together with San Sabino and the dates of 6 December (the day of the saint's death) and 8 May (the day of the arrival of the relics) were declared festive for the city."
