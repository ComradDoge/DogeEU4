 dip_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "The Seventy-Four was a type of two-decked sailing ship of the line which nominally carried 74 guns. It was developed by the French navy in the 1740s and spread to the British Royal Navy where it was classed as third rate. From here, it spread to the Spanish, Dutch, Danish and Russian navies. The design was considered a good balance between firepower and sailing qualities, but more importantly, it was an appealing ideal for naval administrators and bureaucrats. Seventy-fours became a mainstay of the world's fleets into the early 19th century."
 dip_tech_cs_29_desc:0 "As trade grew, so did the risk. New ways of accumulating capital and managing risk needed to be developed. In Joint Stock Companies the risk of enterprise was shared among their many shareholders."
 dip_tech_cs_30_desc:0 "Originally the midshipman was a rank given to an experienced seaman who worked amidships. Men who aspired to become officers would often choose to serve in this role. If we formalize this, and make it a precondition for acquiring the rank of a commissioned officer, we will ensure our future leaders understand the ships they command."
 dip_tech_cs_31_desc:0 "A further reduction of risk came with the development of insurance. The ability for people to offset risk through payment of a small fee to an insurance broker allowed for further growth of trade."

 desc_babbling_buffoon_personality:0 "This ruler is considered to be pulling a Nein. While our ruler means well by personally engaging in diplomacy with our neighbors this is not coupled with a talent for conducting negotiations. Anyone is likely to have a harder time seeing the points we want to make and many of our negotiations are hampered by the ineptness of our ruler. Some might think to just cut their losses and look in other pastures."
