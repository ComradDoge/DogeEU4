 desc_imperialism:0 "In historical contexts, New Imperialism characterizes a period of colonial expansion by European powers, the United States, and Japan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The period featured an unprecedented pursuit of overseas territorial acquisitions. At the time, states focused on building their empires with new technological advances and developments, making their territory bigger through conquest, and exploiting the resources of the subjugated countries. During the era of New Imperialism, the Western powers (and Japan) individually conquered almost all of Africa and parts of Asia. The new wave of imperialism reflected ongoing rivalries among the great powers, the economic desire for new resources and markets."
 desc_industrialization:0 "The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1750 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British."
 desc_nationalism_institution:0 "Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together. This can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with or becoming attached to one's nation. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the first half of the 19th century, and was actively promoted by the European governments and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed and adopted. The political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the national revolutions of Europe, such as the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829. Since that time, nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history."

 vic_institutions.2.t:0 "The Industrial Revolution"
 vic_institutions.2.d:0 "A number of technical innovations during the late 18th century such as steam power has greatly increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth. By building large factories the capitalists can concentrate the large machinery as well as the specialized of labour in one place. This is a huge change over the old system where all work had to be done manually by people or animals and together other recent technical advances this new mode of production will definitely revolutionize society."

This trend is further encouraged by artists who are constructing national symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives. These new personal behaviours that support a state's decisions and actions could be very beneficial, but on the other hand this could lead to increased separatism among those who do not identify with our culture."
