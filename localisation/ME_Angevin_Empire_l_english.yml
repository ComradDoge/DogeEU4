By combining the best aspects of the redcoats and musketeers, we might yet produce the greatest infantry unit to ever exist."

 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.t: "Evolution of the English Culture"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.1: "§GEnglish and French Culture remain unchanged§!. Alongside our union of monarch, our French and English holdings show little intermingling, resulting in a completely divided populace. Even within mostly shared cities, English residents typically settle in close proximity to other Englishmen, as with the French. As a result, cultural exchange seems foolhardy at best to think about."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.2: "§GOne may find traces of cultures blending§!. With the passing of time, so too passes intolerance and ignominy. The French, despite their bitter defeat, have started to acclimate to their new conditions, as have the English. As such occurs, diffusion also occurs, and one may observe several linguistic anomalies already in Normand, which we predict will make their way onto the English mainland in due time."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.3: "§GLanguages loaning words from each other becomes visible in daily life§!. Though a linguistically complex and redundant language, French, nevertheless, has begun to loan out words and phrases to its English counterpart, spurring the diffusion process. Instead of in pound sterling, Englishmen now purchase goods with livre."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.4: "§GFrench influence may be seen in the English Court§!. Though foreign influence is typically an unwanted occurrence, the influencers at hand mean us no harm. The French, through careful political maneuvers, have begun to influence our court. If it were any other nation, we would be up in arms, but seeing as the French have relinquished themselves to their rightful place at our side, we may rest easy."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.5: "§GLanguages start to borrow grammar from each other§!. Grammar between English and French, though similar in some ways, is resoundingly different in others. It would seem as though the aforementioned similarities have begun to shine through, as grammar from one language becomes substituted for the other's. Though this trend is worrying, we should sit by and see where it takes us."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.6: "§GEnglish idioms start to leak into French Language§!. Before, English idioms had forever been part of our identity, kept within our walls and held dearly. With the new turn of cultural diffusion, however, we have begun to see more and more Frenchmen use these phrases, practically robbed from us. Though unsettling, they do no harm, thus we cannot act."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.7: "§GSpeakers of English Accent can be seen in France and vice versa§!. English and French speaking diverged from a young age due to the English Channel presenting difficulties for intercommunication. That divergence has begun to mend as we bridge said channel, bringing both our peoples and our languages closer together. Even now, one may notice Englishmen speaking with a French accent and vice versa."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.8: "§GImpact of English language can be easily seen in the French Aristocratic Language§!. The language of the elite has always differed from the language of the peasantry. That being said, on a political scale, all of England is the aristocracy, and the French are the subjugated serfs. As such, many of our common terms can be easily seen in the French aristocracy's way of speaking, bringing us to believe they have recognized our language as fully superior."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.9: "§GFrench Grammar heavily influenced by English§!. Grammar is an interesting issue to mull over, but in recent events, we are not sure which grammar to be using. With more and more linguistic culture arriving from England, the French grammar is merely a husk of what it used to be."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.10: "§GFrench is more comparable to Germanic languages than to its Romance cousins§!. We have noticed a trend. Not a positive one, nor a negative, but a trend nonetheless. Though French has long since been an ancestor of Latin, it would seem as though it has undergone a shift from its Romance origins to one of Germanic tongue, seemingly stemming from our conquest of the region. Though the Spaniards and French never shared much linguistic commonalities, any similarities are now gone."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.a: "Okay."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.4.t: "The Culmination of Language Evolution"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.4.d: "With decades of cultural blending the French Cultures have finally been brought closer to their English Overlords. English, previously influenced by French, has now made a massive impact on the French Cultures of the Continent. The French can now consider them as our brethren."
