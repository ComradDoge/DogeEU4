 #Events:
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.1.t: "The Nomadic People"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.1.d: "For years the Nomads in the north have been a thorn on our side. Now however, most of them have been subjugated by us and are willing to serve in our army. Whilst they will greatly bolster our ranks, it would be better to stick to our current army, with experience in fighting against these people."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.1.a: "We will recruit them to our army."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.1.b: "our nomadic frontier will not end here"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.2.t: "Conquest of Uzbek"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.2.d: "The lands of the Uzbek tribes have finally fallen to our hands. Many of their cities, unlike the rest of the Turcic tribes, are filled with much loot. Our men are eager to loot anything they find, but that would mean these cities would not be able to prosper as much."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.2.a: "They have raided us many times. We will do the same here"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.2.b: "Their cities are better off thriving"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.3.t: "The Eastern Expedition"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.3.d: "In the lands where Timur died, we have made success. Our armies have crossed the many mountains and deserts to subdue the tribes there. Our plans for the invasion of China are even closer, and the only thing is preparing these lands to greatly aid us in such invasion."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.3.a: "Is that gold I see?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.3.b: "Let us prepare the fortifications."
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.4.t: "Successor of Temujin"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.4.d: "The great Khan may have perished a long time ago, but many of his offsprings lay claim to his legacy. The most notable of them are the remnants of the Yuan dynasty, the most legitimate of the claims, and the dead Tamerlane, founder of our Empire. Whilst we can claim the Empire for ourselves, it would be better to use the Yuan remnants to claim it instead."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.4.a: "His true successors are better of as our vassals"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.4.b: "We are the successors of the Mongol Empire"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.5.t: "Legacy of the Yuan Dynasty"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.5.d: "The Yuan dynasty were once the masters of China, rulling a vast and rich realm that was considered unbeatable. The many rebellions however made them lose power, and eventually they were overthrown by the Ming dynasty. Tamerlane wished to restore the dynasty, but died in the process. It is now up to us to finish the task he started long ago."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.5.a: "The Emperors of the Borjigin dynasty shall reclaim their rightful throne."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.5.b: "I am the Emperor of China."
 me_tim_gain_access_to_all_chinese_monuments: "We will gain access to all §YChinese Monuments§!"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.6.t: "The Mandate of Heaven"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.6.d: "With the help of the Timurid Empire, we have finally managed to reclaim our rightful throne. Unlike before however, we will ensure that our power does not fall off."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.6.a: "An age of prosperity has began."
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.7.t: "The Homeland of Yuan"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.7.d: "The Yuan dynasty after their defeat had fled to Mongolia, where the Oirat Khanate rose to power, and subjugated them. Now, we have taken their lands. What shall we do with them?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.7.a: "Let us restore them"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.7.b: "We are in charge now"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.8.t: "Nomadic Riches?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.8.d: "WIth the final nomads under our rule, our nomadic conquests have been complete. The steppe region, compared to the rich cities of Iran, are barren, without much life in it. We however see a lot of potential in their lands, be it creating a few urban centers, or developing the entire countryside."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.8.a: "It will not come over time, but it will surely come with our aid."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.8.b: "Focusing on a few cities only is better."
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.9.t: "The Return"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.9.d: "With the fall of the Golden Horde, we have finally completed our quest to re-integrate its lands to Timur's Empire. Whilst they are being ruled by a different dynasty, its people are still resilient to our rule. What shall we do with them?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.9.a: "We will show the people some nostalgia"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.9.b: "It would be better to integrate them instead"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.10.t: "Kazan's Gold"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.10.d: "The lands of Kazan may not be the richest, but they contain a lot of values we can exploit. Most notable is the gold in [2444.GetName]. Whilst we can use the mines for our own gain, the leaders of Kazan would be far better off as our vassals, ready to rein in the Tatar Yoke in Russia."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.10.a: "Let us exploit this gold source"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.10.c: "They are better off as our vassal"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.11.t: "The Tatar Yoke"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.11.d: "With the end of the Russian age in Eastern Europe, the Tatars have made a return. Whilst the Tatars are not completely independent, their leaders would be more than grateful if we allowed them to administrate the region."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.11.a: "They pushed the nomads back with cruently before, and now we will treat them the same"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.11.b: "Let the Tatar Yoke be re-stablished"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.12.t: "Governorship of Persia"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.12.d: "The last Timurid governor of Persia turned out to be a traitor, only wishing to empower his own realm rather than help the Empire. Now that we have beaten him, we can finally decide what we will do with him. Shall we replace him, or shall we rule the lands on our own?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.12.a: "A loyal governor in Persia would never backfire"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.12.b: "We all know how that went last time"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.13.t: "Death of the Black Sheep"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.13.d: "With the Black Sheep wiped off the map, we have finally put an end to his rebellious reign in Mesopotamia. Now their cities are once again under our control. Shall we remind their people why abandoning our rule was unwise?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.13.a: "The lands are perfect for our economy"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.13.b: "We sacked Baghdad twice, we can do it a third time"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.14.t: "Levantine Conquest"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.14.d: "The Levant has been secured. We are now one step closer to our war against the Ottomans. Many of our generals suggest we take a defensive approach, as we do not have the momentum we had last time, whilst others are suggesting we take the initiative."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.14.a: "We will pursue a defensive strategy"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.14.b: "Against the Anatolians, we will go on the offense"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.15.t: "An Anatolian Subject"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.15.d: "With the Anatolian region under our grip, we have finally eclipsed our old rivals. Whilst last time we simply left the region in turmoil, this time we have plans to fully integrate them to our Empire. We can either establish a governor here, or lay waste to it and build anew."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.15.a: "A New Governor in Rum"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.15.b: "It would be better to destroy our rival's lands"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.16.t: "The Hormuz Strait"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.16.d: "The Hormuz Sultanate was established thanks to our rule over Persia. We had helped them carve out a little trade Empire, but they instead stabbed us in the back and only looked for their own profit. Now, Hormuz is ours once again. What shall we do with it?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.16.a: "We will maintain the toll Hormuz put there"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.16.b: "Let us remove it"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.16.c: "Focusing on the province's prosperity is better"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.16.dd: "They betrayed us in the past. Vengeance here is justified"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.17.t: "Arabian Horsemanship"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.17.d: "Arabia is most famed for its horses and its riders, some of the most skilled in the world. Many nations, European, Asian or African, have always tried to purchase their horses and learn of their tactics. We however have conquered the region and turned a profit off it. Shall we perhaps use their horses, or shall we learn of their tactics?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.17.a: "They have the finest of horses. We can exploit that fact"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.17.b: "Their people will teach us of their tactics instead"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.18.t: "Trade Dominance"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.18.d: "Our merchants prosper from Anatolia to India. Once, we were brutal conquerors, now we're Empire builders. We will build an Empire of wealth, an Empire that will not depend on steel, but gold. We will no longer need to sack the cities of our enemies, but merely conquer them with armies paid by our unlimited coffers. This is a new age for the Timurid Empire."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.18.a: "The trade must flow"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.19.t: "Fall of Delhi"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.19.d: "The city of Delhi has once again fallen to our hands. Unlike last time, it is not that propering city in Northern India, but a fraction of its past glory. We can try to loot it once again, but it will not be as worthwile as before."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.19.a: "Burn the city to the ground. Destroy it!"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.19.b: "We will put it to use instead"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.20.t: "Caspian Silk"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.20.d: "The Caspian cities are known for their silk production, with most of their economy depending on them. Now, their cities are finally ours. We can either promote the production of even more of their silk, or we can tax them even more for our own gain"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.20.a: "Focus on production there"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.20.b: "A short-term investment is better"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.21.t: "Georgia's Mountains"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.21.d: "Unlike last time, Georgia has been fully conquered, with not a sovereign ruler paying tribute to us. We have realized however that these lands are unlike the rest of our glorious conquests. The people hide behind mountains, following a faith that is close to ours, yet is still heathenous."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.21.a: "They will follow our religion, unlike last time"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.21.b: "Let us increase their taxes instead"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.22.t: "Fate of the Caliph"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.22.d: "With the Caliph in our hands, it is time to decide. Many men before us had him as a puppet, using him for their own gain, ignoring the laws of Islam. Now, we can finally put an end to that puppeteering, or we can do it ourselves."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.22.a: "Execute him"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.22.b: "Move him to our court"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.23.t: "Honoring Timur's Legacy"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.23.d: "Whilst our great founder is long gone, his legacy still remains. [Monarch.GetName] has done everything he could in order to emulate his legends, and our people have taken notice. Some of them even praise him as 'Tamerlane the Second'. Whilst he is not as great as him, this is only a proof that our people remember him as one of the great men in history"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.23.a: "He will never be forgotten"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.24.t: "The Timurid Empire"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.24.a: "Rejoice!"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.25.t: "Rome's Legacy"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.25.d: "The Roman Empire may be gone, but their legacy still remains. [151.GetName] remains as the remnants to that legacy. The once great city, that is now a shadow of its former glory, is in our hands. Is it time to give the proper care to the City of the World's Desire?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.25.a: "Rome? We care not about such Empires"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.25.b: "We will honor their dead legacy"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.26.t: "The Persian People"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.26.d: "Our court and rulers may not be primarily Persian, but our nation is. Long gone are the days of our Turkic traditions, as we have integrated ever closer to the culture of the once many great Empires of Iran. We can follow on their footsteps, or we can simply retain what makes our Empire different than theirs."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.26.a: "We shall declare ourselves as a true Persian nation"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.26.b: "They are part of our Empire, not our Empire"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.27.t: "A Diverse Court"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.27.d: "Unlike the ages of old, our court has seen drastic changes to its culture. Instead of it being modelled after the Turkic nomads, it has seen a change to it from the many cultures our Empire has conquered. Shall we change its character, or shall we try to maintain our old traditions?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.27.a: "Our ways must change"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.27.b: "We shall maintain our old traditions"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.28.t: "Cloth Conversion"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.28.d: "With our dominance over silk, we are left with wanting more. Many of our merchants suggest that we replace our cloth production with silk once, securing an even greater monopoly, whilst many others suggest we focus on our current silk production."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.28.a: "Our current silk is more valuable"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.28.b: "We need more silk"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.29.t: "The Silk Trade"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.29.d: "The old Silk Road may not be as grand as it was, but our efforts to reconstruct it have paid off. New caravans pass every day through that road, bringing in more riches than before. The prices of silk as well have increased, as we are now able to use the road once again to access the markets of China and Europe."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.29.a: "The Persian region will prosper once again"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.30.t: "Hindustani Governance"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.30.d: "The region of Northern India had never come under our rule properly before. Instead, we had placed a local governor and recruited some of their troops to serve in our armies. Now that we have tighetened our grip in the region, we can finally decide to put a governor in charge."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.30.a: "Establish a Hindu governor"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.30.b: "Put in charge a Muslim one"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.31.t: "Pinnacle of Islamic Arts"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.31.d: "The Islamic Golden Age may be gone, but the Timurid Renaissance still beacons in the Islamic world. With many scholars, monuments, and technological advancement being thanks to our patronage, we are regarded as the founders of a new age."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.31.a: "Allah is glorious"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.32.t: "Military Reforms"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.32.d: "If our armies are to dominate the battlefield, they must also adapt. Many of our advisors see that our realm is vast, and depend on the many governors in it to supply it, so they suggest that we use them to reform the army how we want to, but without a unified character in it. Many more suggest that centralizing our army and training it to serve our needs will be best."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.32.a: "Our governors will provide us of our armies"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.32.b: "The army shall be centered around the Emperor"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.33.t: "Learning from the Past"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.33.d: "Many battles were won, and many were lost. What matters however is that we learned from the failures, and we adapted. That is the only way for an Empire to survive and expand. We shall now take a note from these mistakes, and further empower our armies."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.33.a: "Strike fast, strike hard, strike often"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.33.b: "We will not yield on the battlefield"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.34.t: "A Gunpowder Empire?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.34.d: "Whilst not as prestigious as other Gunpowder Empires, our realm is also renowned for its use of gunpowder of the battlefield, specifically artillery. Instead of relying on old weaponry, we have used this new technology to decimate enemy fortifications, and to put pressure on the battlefield."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.34.a: "If we amass our artillery, then the enemy will be crushed by the firepower"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.34.b: "A precise artillery pieces will benefit us more"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.35.t: "A Nestorian Saint?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.35.d: "Many of our people are becoming zealous over our conversion to Christianity. Considering that we do not have the legitimacy it takes to justify such action, we will do the unthinkable: rewrite history. Rather than treating the founder of our nation, Timur, as a faithful Muslim, we will rewrite him as a Nestorian Saint. How we got this idea has amazed everyone in the court, but they're still content with it"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.35.a: "It must be the Slovak people....."
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.36.t: "The Apocalypse"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.36.d: "The Christian bible had once spoken of the end of the world. Its apocalypse brought by the Four Horsemen, §RDeath§!, §RFamine§!, §RWar§!, §RConquest§!. Many of our enemies have proclaimed us as the personification of them, and fear us. They see us as simple barbarians who only conquer and destroy."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.36.a: "Come men, let us bring forth the end of man."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.36.b: "If the apocalypse ever comes, we will not be the ones bringing it"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.38.t: "Returning to the Old Ways"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.38.d: "Our now many riders were not always part of the Islamic faith. They believed in the ways of Tengrism, looting and destroying anyone in their way in his name. With their integration into the Persian societies, they have become less brutal. This however has led to their fighting capabilities decreasing. Perhaps it is time to return them to the way of old again."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.38.a: "We were once Tengri people. Let us become Tengri again"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.38.b: "We will only tolerate them, not embrace their ways"

 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.39.t: "Defending the Persian Gulf"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.39.d: "With the fortress in Hormuz built, we must now give it a purpose. Whilst making it an unbreachable fortress would benefit us greatly, others debate that transofrming it to fight off any naval activities would be even more wothwhile in our defence of the Persian gulf."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.39.a: "We must be prepared for any naval activities in the area"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.39.b: "Make the island into a fortress instead"

 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.40.t: "The Scourge of Arabia"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.40.d: "With the land of Prophet Muhammad under our rule, the people fear us. With many years of war and looting as a result of our conquests there, they hate us. The only thing left is to decide if they're really worth destroying."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.40.a: "Arabia will never prosper again"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.40.b: "We shall not ruin this region anymore"

 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.41.t: "Tengrism"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.41.d: "Many of our lands still follow the old faith of the nomads. Those Tengri believers are not as brutal as some of the other religious followers. They represent our society as it was before, savage yet not caring of faith. Are we really going to tarnish their legacy, and remove them?"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.41.a: "Tolerate our old people, even if they're of an old religion"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.41.b: "We will convert any non-believer"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.42.t: "Bringing Destruction"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.42.d: "As we lay waste to more and more cities, we discover ever-so much new stuff. From new technologies, to new ways of life, to even new military tactics. We may be brutal raiders, but even our tribes can thrive from all of the new loot we take every year."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.42.a: "With this destruction, our nation will thrive"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.42.b: "Only destruction and death. That is our only purpose"

 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.43.t: "Fate of the Tatar People"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.43.d: "With the Tatar tribes finally destroyed, many of them lay prisoners in our warbands. Like us, they were nomads who raided and pillaged everything in their path, and their culture resembles ours. Taking them prisoners in our army would be too much of a waste."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.43.a: "They will settle in our nation"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.43.b: "Forcing them to our armies as slaves shall be our choice"

 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.44.t: "Fate of the Black Sheep"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.44.d: "The Black Sheep that was so ever proudly led by its many tribes has finally been defeated. Their cheiftains may not be as skilled as us, but they're willing to integrate to our societies, joining our conquest spree and sharing the loot they take. ALternatively, we can execute them as an example of what happens to resistance."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.44.a: "Their leaders are allowed to serve in our tribe"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.44.b: "Execute them"

 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.45.t: "Revenge Against the Osmans"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.45.d: "With another bloody battle at Ankara, we have finally put an end to the Ottomans. Their Sultan now lays as our prisoner, with [Root.Monarch.GetName] ready to humiliate him. Whilst parading him in [Root.Capital.GetName] would bolster the morale of our nation, it would slow down our momentum."
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.45.a: "We will parade the Sultan's head in our capital"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.45.b: "No need for such demonstrations. Recruit any able person into our army"
 
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.46.t: "Remnants of Greece"
 ME_Timurid_Main_Events.46.d: "The once proud Greek civilization now lies in ruins. With their many scholars and 'cultured' people taken prisoners, their nation is now in our hands. Whilst allowing them to live would go against our ideals, their abilities may serve beneficial for our tribe."
