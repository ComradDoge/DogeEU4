However, due to the disconent in the Cortes, and the mutterings of the Lisbon camara, Infante Pedro was convinced to rule as co-regent and later as the sole regent.

 ME_Portugal_Events.4.t: "The Ceuta Gold Barter"
 ME_Portugal_Events.4.d: "Ceuta has long been a center of trade from across the Muslim world, with caravans from Baghdad to Fez gathering there. This was why we, in 1415, seized the city from the decadent Marinids in a secretive campaign, who had found themselves in strife with their brethren across the strait. This has proven to have been the harbinger of our rise as a commercial power, as the caravans that were once under the Sacraens have fallen now under us.\n\nOne of the things brought forth by these caravans has been the gold from past the Sahara, which has peeked the interest of our treasurers, who have already begun to use this gold to mint coin, namely the escudo, after a drought of almost half a century, despite the already profitable exports of coral and tuna and the relatively poor quality of the gold dust that trickles in. Whilst this seems like an endeavor we'd wish to focus on for the port city, we are likely to get better avenues of acquiring this gold before long, and funding the caravans that are already hesitant to go to Ceuta over Tangiers may prove to harm local production."
 ME_Portugal_Events.4.a: "Let the gold trade dominate."
 ME_Portugal_Events.4.b: "I want a bass on my plate tonight."
 
 ME_Portugal_Events.5.t: "Ceuta Ceases to Profit"
 ME_Portugal_Events.5.d: "When we prioritized the trade of gold dust with the caravans of Ceuta, we were inherently aware of the fact that the gold was of higher price and lower quality than we could acquire otherwise, and that the local exports of tuna and coral would, in the long term, prove to be more sustainable.\n\nHowever, we didn't expect that time to come so soon as we continue on the path of Henrique. Our trade posts further along the coast of Africa have proven to be vastly more profitable in the gold barter than Ceuta ever was, and with better quality gold at that. Already, those treasurers  who pivoted to reforming the economy under the escudo under King Duarte have begun to rapidly shift towards a coin of greater quality, the cruzado. Ceuta can no longer maintain its' position as our main hub for gold bartering, and tuna exports must resume  their primacy."

Created as a means to mend the 1750s Wine crisis. It would transform the wine produced in Upper Douro from a poor man's drink to a fine wine fit for gentlemen.

Having its beginnings in Lisbon, it would be moved to Coimbra in 1308. Once again moved in 1338, it would return to Coimbra in 1354. Similarly, it was moved in 1377, but would once again be brought in 1537. We need to bring an end to the itinerant University, wreaking havoc within our education.

 ME_Portugal_Events.12.d: "As of late, we have discovered, at last, a defensible location for a potential trade outpost alongside the sub-Saharan coast, that being the island of Arguim. With its' proximity to the caravan hub of Wadan, this will prove invaluable in asserting our trade and expanding our coffers.\n\nHowever, now, we must decide how we intend to use Arguim. We have already been engaging in razias against the nearby coastline for the purpose of acquiring slaves, angering the local powers but supplying us with a sizable workforce that will prove invaluable in the future. Arguim's position is amongst the best we could have for these raids. However, we have long been looking for a proper source of quality gold dust, for Ceuta is sadly inadequate in the long term, and given the wealth the local caravans hold, it may be advisable to instead intensify  our existing bartering efforts.\n\nEither way, Arguim's position would greatly benefit these efforts, whichever we choose to prioritize."

 ME_Portugal_Events.13.d: "The Cape Verde islands were discovered in 1456, by two explorers of Italian Origin in the service of Prince Henrique, Antoniotto Usodimare and Alvise Cadamosto, later more thoroughly explored by António de Noli. Initially granted as a donataria to Prince Fernando, Henrique's heir, it would be reintegrated into the crown in 1495. An archipelago of eleven volcanic islands, only about half of them were suitable for settlements early on, with settlements being placed on two islands in the 15th century. As the climate was harsh and unsuitable for settlers from Portugal, the crown tried to grant numerous privieleges to the settlers regarding trade in Guinea. A native crop, cotton soon became the main export of the island, as it was in high demand in mainland Africa, and proved suitable for trade."

If we are able to grow these plants natively, we may be able to reduce our reliance on sometimes untrustworthy merchants from the Orient, even if introducing the plant would drastically change the existing economy of the isles. Meanwhile, the isles have already become known for having high-quality farmlands in general, something that may prove more valuable in maintaining the living conditions of our loyal subjects."

Whilst they presently have no clear indication of disloyalty, their power has already given the [Root.GetNobilityNameOrFallback] recourse to gradually increase their own power. Already, they can field an army  of 10,000 men just under their private banner, and if they were to sense weakness in the crown, it is likely that they would leap at the opportunity to increase their own power, or, perhaps, take the throne given their ties to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty].\n\nOur [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetName] is keenly aware of this threat, and it is their opinion that action must be taken to undermine the dragon that was born of Afonso's empowerment, or may we be ensnared by it."

The Duke of Coimbra was one of the first deaths, killed by an arrow. With his death, the levies of his holdings lost all organization, and almost all of the rebellious forces lay dead, piles upon piles of bodies, as the dust settles, with the remaining forces scattering to the countryside, unable to pose a reliable threat ever again with the loss of Peter.\n\nWhilst this secures the supremacy of the main line of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty], many have been left disillusioned by the slaughter, with only Henrique now remaining of the first generation of the House of Avis, having isolated himself due to his mistrust at court, sewn by his rivals and former allies.

Whilst this isn't as profitable as our existing gold trade, it has already proven to be of great value. \n\nHowever, we still do not get much of a share of this trade directly due to relaxed tarrifs on the diamonds of Brazil in order to encourage their trade far and wide as to shatter the existing monopolies. Should we increase the tarrifs, we will undoubtedly anger our merchants and settlers abroad, even if it'd bring us great wealth."

However, colonial endeavors to the west and east has led to us largely ignoring our crusader legacy... until recently.\n\nKing Sebastiao, having been risen in the environment of the Counter-Reformation, grew to have a personal obsession with the ideal of repulsing the Arabs of the Maghreb, restoring the long-lost Christian majorities of those lands, as an extension of the long-finished Reconqustida. To these ends, he required that noble youths who wished to become knights to either serve three years in our Maghreb territories or to perform exceptionally well in India, making it the priority of any up and coming noble to serve in Ceuta and Tangiers, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has repeatedly paid visits to our vanguards in the lands of the south.\n\nNow, due to both our clever exploitation of internal divisions in Morocco and our zealous men, Morocco has fallen under our banner, and the Reconqustida has been resumed."

However, no people could use this produce more effectively than us, given that cod has already become a core component of the Portuguese diet, and many fishing vessels already undertake the dangerous journey to reach these rich fisheries. However, we have yet to actually do much settlement of the gulf, with previous efforts failing to establish a long-term presence in the region.\n\nHowever, we have diverted in recent times substantial efforts and resources to the cape, and, namely, Newfoundland, in order to take the cod of the region before the English do.

Another two voyages were conducted by Gonçalo Coelho int he following years, discovering much of Brazil in that time.

Most of the slaves were shipped to Portuguese Brazil, whose merchants and plantation owners became so reliant on this region, that the local government did its best to secure rights to bypass Lisbon and trade directly with the region. Local Mbundu and Imbangala became slave raiders and traders who would supply the Portuguese, leading the local tribes to become devastated and constantly torn by war.

 ME_Portuguese_Explorers_Events.1.d: "Diogo Gomes, a native of Lagos, started out as just a page in the household of the Infante Henirque the Navigator, but over time, worked up the ranks of the household until, in 1440, Diogo had risen to the rank of cavaliero, in other words knight. By this point, Henrique already saw great potential in the young man, and it wasn’t long before Diogo was assisting Henrique and his colleagues in razias and exploration, claiming to have captured 22 Berber slaves singlehandedly during a raid on the banks of Arguim in 1445 under Lançarote de Freitas.\n\nHowever, what gave Diogo great fame wasn't the razias he was involved in, or how many slaves he claimed to have taken, but instead the expedition Henrique sent him on in 1456 along the African coast, alongside an Ethopian interpreter named Jacob. In this expedition, Diogo went far into the Terra Incognitia, reaching the Rio Grande of Guinea before strong currents led to his officers forcing a return. On the return journey, however, Diogo Gomes explored the Gambia River, getting as far as the town of Cantor, an important entrepot of the Malian gold trade that Portugal had been chasing ever since they took Ceuta 41 years prior. In the process of peaceful interactions with the natives, he discovered much about the local gold trade, alongside the trade routes between the various Sub-Saharan cities and Morocco, alongside managing to convert one local chief, Numimasa, chief of the Nomi Bato, to Christianity.\n\nUpon his return, Diogo continued to climb up the ranks, becoming the almoxarife of Sintra, and later returning to Africa in 1462 for the purposes of trade, only to eventually go on a return journey with the Genoese captain Antonio de Noli. By the end of his life, Diogo Gomes had, under the banner of the Infante Henrique, paved the road for the vast Portuguese colonial empire that would emerge in due time."

Instead, they are both merchants, and as with most merchants of the times, are from the decadent city states and mercantile republics of Italy, specifically Venice and Genoa respectively.\n\nHired by the Infante Henrique as part of his efforts to find a maritime route to the Indies, the two went on a joint series of expeditions concurrently with Diogo Gomes, discovering both the Cape Verde isles that would later become a notable outpost on the way to the New World, but also much of the Guinea Coast, getting as far as the Geba River.\n\nWhilst they only ever discovered hostility and found themselves unable to tap into the Sub-Saharan gold trade, unlike their contemporaries, largely being limited by the understanding of their interpreters, their journeys still had a sizable impact on the Portuguese era of exploration regardless."

As such, he hired many up-and-coming explorers to fulfill the grant, and as such not only succeeded in fulfilling the requirements of the grant, and exceeding them, reaching the Cape of Saint Catarina, and, later, Elmina in 1471, which proved to be the true jackpot Portugal had been lacking in regards to acquiring copious amounts of that glimmering metal, gold.\n\nAs such, Fernão would rapidly accrue considerable amounts of wealth from his warehouse in Elmina, becoming known as Fernão Gomes da Mine in 1474, and later helping to bankroll Portuguese interests in Morocco, being knighted in the process, and becoming a member of the royal council in 1478. Eventually, Elmina Castle was built in 1482 to manage the gold trade he had tapped into.\n\nHowever, he would have never been able to become as wealthy as he did without the support of his valiant hirees, who sailed far into the Terra Incognitia for god, glory, and gold."

By August 1482, Diogo erected a padrão at Shark Point, marking the arrival of Portugal at the Congo River. Following this, he sailed up the river, establishing contact and commerce with denizens of the Bakongo kingdom, even taking 4 hostage after erecting his second padrão at Cabo de Santa Maria due to 4 missionaries not returning from their journey to the leader of the kingdom.\n\nLater, Cão was sent back to find the 4 missing missionaries, and alongside sailing up to the falls of Ielala, erected 2 more padrãos, one at Cabo Negro and one at Cape Cross, reaching as far as 1,400 kilometers south of Lisbon."

 ME_Portuguese_Explorers_Events.5.d: "Bartolemeu Dias's family had a long maritime heritage, with one of his ancestors having discovered the Cap-Vert peninsula in 1445. As such, he inherited considerable maritime prowess, already having been involved in the ivory trade along the Guinea Coast in 1478, and assisting in the construction of the São Jorgo da Mina in the same areas in 1481.\n\nHowever, what Dias is known for is not his maritime exploits as a trader, but his exploits as an explorer for the Portuguese Crown. Serving as a cavailer in the King's household by 1486, he would be sent on a voyage to advance the work of Diogo Cão and to hunt for the mythical Prester John in the summer of 1487.  To these ends, he was given 2 caravels and a supply ship manned by his brother.\n\nLike Cão, Dias erected padrãos to mark his journey, and also like his precedessor, he carried with him 6 African slaves, kidnapped by Cão and taught the tongue of the crown, as to use them to testify for the grandeur of Portugal and as to make inquiries to the location of Prester John.\n\nAt first, the goal was the Congo, but Dias had loftier goals, and as the ships moved further south, they named geographic features for Catholic saints. By the time the ship had reached Porto Alexandre, Dias opted to leave the supply ship behind so that it could resupply them on the return journey. Little did Dias know just how far he would go.\n\nAfter reaching the Golfo da Conceição, the ships turned southwest for unknown reasons, and by a miracle, it was discovered that the currents were far more favorable there. On the 4th of February, 1488, the ships that had been at sea for 30 days finally returned to land at Mossel Bay. After resting, the ships continued east and realized that the coast was gradually turning northeast. This was when Dias realized that he had achieved Portugal's goal of the past decades: he had rounded the southern cape of Africa, establishing a viable course to the Indies."

 ME_Portuguese_Explorers_Events.6.d: "Vasco da Gama rose rapidly through the ranks of the social order of Portugal, and was already civil governor of his hometown before he was even 10. When João II ascended to the throne in 1480, he gave particular attention to the Order of Santiago, and when da Gama joined it, following his father, his prospect rapidly rose as he quickly rose through the ranks of the Order, catching the attention of the royal court.\n\nBy 1497, Vasco da Gama was known as an expert of the waves. As such, when João saw the prospect of India being reached in the near future after numerous expeditions to chart the region via spies and expeditions, he chose da Gama for the job, granting him four ships. He would depart on the 8th of July, 1497, from Lisboa. Alongside da Gama were some of Portugal's most accomplished explorers. At first, Da Gama followed the route of Dias before him, and reaching the Cape of Good Hope by the 4th of November, 1497, already having traveled 10,000 kilometers on the open sea. However, his voyage would now go into the Terra Incognitia.\n\nFrom the 2nd of March to the 29th, Vasco da Gama and his crew were anchored at Mozambique Island, and in order to get a seat with the local Sultan, da Gama impersonated a Muslim. However, after da Gama proved unable to provide a worthy gift to the Sultan, the local populace grew suspicious and chased him out, with him bombarding the city in retaliation. Next, as the ship neared Mombasa, they were forced to resort to piracy, lotting unarmed Arab merchant ships, and being chased out of Mombasa after a brief stay due to these acts. By the 14th of April, da Gama reached the port of Malindi, who was friendlier to his crew. It would be from here that he would start the dangerous journey on the open seas to Calicut in India, becoming the first European to go from Europe to India around Africa, establishing the main route Portugal would use for its trade and colonial empire."
