 dse_buddhism_flavour.001.t:1 "The fountain-head of Buddhism"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.001.d:1 "Sri Lanka was a vital source of Theravada Buddhism, and countries that adopted the faith often imported Buddhist monks or texts from the island to supplement their own.  Occasionally, rulers would send their sons to study Buddhism there, a trend which further cemented the island's reputation."

 dse_buddhism_flavour.001.b:1 "He is needed in $COUNTRY$"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.002.t:1 "The Forest Tradition"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.002.d:1 "Following the example of the Buddha himself, some monks chose to live austere lives in the wilderness in order to practice simple lives of renunciation and meditation.  Dwelling in remote areas far away from society, monks of the Forest Tradition attempted to preserve the way of life practiced by ancient Buddhists.  This meant that they were apart from the Sangha (community of Buddhists) and did not serve as an example the way that other monks did.  On the other hand, it meant that if a monastery became corrupt or abandoned, forest monks could reestablish a pure lineage there."
 dse_buddhism_flavour.002.a:1 "Praise this austere way of life"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.002.b:1 "Criticize the monks for abandoning society's needs"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.003.t:1 "Famous monastery"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.003.d:1 "Buddhist monks meditated on the nature of enlightenment and were privy to the secret teachings of the Buddha.  This gave them great respect from worshippers who sought to learn from them.  Particularly accomplished monks could become famous for their teaching, drawing visitors to their monasteries who bore offerings in return for their wisdom.  Successful monks meant a steady stream of wealth, power and fame attaching itself to a monastery, becoming increasingly powerful.  Although this wealth was used for noble purposes, over time monks could forget their humble roots and become increasingly arrogant."
 dse_buddhism_flavour.003.a:1 "Ask the monks for a blessing"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.003.b:1 "Criticize their conspicuous wealth"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.004.t:1 "Monastic lineage dies out"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.004.d:1 "One of the oldest $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ monastic orders has just died out in $COUNTRY$.  \n\n Monastic orders were proud of their lineage, with each being able to trace a line of ordination from master to novice all the way back to a founding Buddha.  This gave the orders considerable prestige, but it also required constant vigilance.  If a monk was found to be corrupt or even just felt he had failed his vows, his ordination was revoked - along with that of all monks he had personally ordained.  In such cases monks had to seek out the blessings of another member of the same order.  This was usually not a problem, but when an order shrank in size, it could be difficult to find another with the same lineage.  In such cases, entire orders could be disbanded.  It was not unheard of for a ruler to personally get involved, summoning monks from other Buddhist nations in order to restart a lineage."

 dse_buddhism_flavour.005.t:1 "Abandoned Monasteries"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.005.d:1 "Our military governors report that Buddhist monasteries are closing their doors, their monks abandoning them to travel to lands more sympathetic to their religion.  With them, they are taking scrolls and paintings that have great value to their faith - and some value even to a $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ collector, perhaps.\n\nBuddhism is a religion which emphasizes the international unity of Buddhism: a Buddhist can just as easily practice his faith in one country as another.  This encouraged monks to emigrate rather than face persecution, and led to the loss of many monasteries."
 dse_buddhism_flavour.005.a:1 "With them gone, the masses will be easier to convert"

 dse_buddhism_flavour.006.b:1 "Build monasteries for the newcomers"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.007.t:1 "Going Forth"
 dse_buddhism_flavour.007.d:1 "It is time for [Root.Heir.GetName] to do [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] duty and be ordained as a monk.  \n\nIn the Theravada tradition, children as young as 7 years old were ordained as a kind of initiate in a process called Going Forth.  Young boys, and sometimes girls, were dressed in fine robes and paraded around town before being delivered to a monastery where they had their heads shaved and fine robes exchanged for the simple saffron robes of a monk.  There, they made ten vows and lived among the monks for a short time - as little as a week, or as long as the full two years of an initiate monk.  After that, they returned to their regular lives.\n\nEven royalty took part in this coming of age ritual, with many a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] able to claim to have once been a monk.  The question isn't whether [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] should go - the question is, for how long?"
