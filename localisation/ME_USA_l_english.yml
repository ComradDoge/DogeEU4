 # Missions:
 usa_the_continental_army_title: "Continental Army"
 usa_the_continental_army_desc: "Mostly consisting of patriots and indentured servants, our army is nothing but a scrambling militia... but perhaps we can take advantage of that. Small localized militias can answer within minutes of enemy attacks, offering substantial protection in the face of heinous opposition."
 usa_arm_the_populace_title: "Arm the Populace"
 usa_arm_the_populace_desc: "The main hinderance for a nation, when constructing an army, is training and supplying the army with firearms. There is a simple solution to this issue. By allowing every citizen to own a firearm, we can field a far larger army while also enforcing our own values. Death to tyrants!"
 usa_chain_of_command_title: "Chain of Command"
 usa_chain_of_command_desc: "Whilst the militias provide hearty men for tough times, the foes we face grow greater and greater. In the event of an offensive war, the militias will provide little help, especially 'gainst defensive armies. Thus, we will forge a command structure and invoke discipline to truly forge an [Root.GetAdjective] Army."
 usa_amerindian_divisions_title: "Amerindian Divisions"
 usa_amerindian_divisions_desc: "Before us lies a changed people; a people wrought by the blood of their blistered feet and sweat of their beaten brows. Perhaps they have become born anew in the kiln of their own making. We must give them credit: they are a resiliant bunch. In many ways, the perfect soldiers. We should take the time to integrate American Indians into the US Army to bolster our ranks."
 usa_allot_reservations_title: "Allot Reservations"
 usa_allot_reservations_desc: "The Indians have proven themselves worthy of humanity. Loyal to the end, they are deserving of our praise. As we expand westward, we should allot lands for the natives to call their own and resume their tribal ways of life. Let us start this program with the Navajos; they have proven to be excellent soldiers."
 usa_forge_the_constitution_title: "Forge the Constitution"
 usa_forge_the_constitution_desc: "The Articles of Confederation have served their purpose, albeit poorly. That being said, with the widespread prosperity America is now facing, we can afford to allocate resources to drafting a true and powerful constitution to create an efficient state."
 usa_establish_the_cabinet_title: "Establish the Cabinet"
 usa_establish_the_cabinet_desc: "Should the fate of a nation rest on the shoulders of one man, we should worry not for the man's shoulders, but for his back, for it will surely break under the weight. It is imperative we establish the Cabinet of the President, or we risk losing the stability and prosperity we have fought so long for. In the end. There is no question for who will be in this cabinet, however. Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry Knox will provide adequate leadership for our nation. Quite the cabinet, indeed!"
 usa_an_american_dollar_title: "An American Dollar"
 usa_an_american_dollar_desc: "In the wake of separation from Europe, we have thrust onto ourselves a financial crisis. Our currency is loosely backed by what gold we can find, and our economy is held up by trade alone. We need to invest further into the economic machinations that allow a nation to function effectively."
 usa_civilize_the_plains_title: "Civilize the Plains"
 usa_civilize_the_plains_desc: "Upon our righteous march west lies vast expanses of flowing plains and great buffalo, perfect for hunting. Unfortunately, several tribes of Indians seem to call these lands their home. Suffice to say, we have to ensure they recognize our dominion over the plains."
 usa_indian_removal_act_title: "Indian Removal Act"
 usa_indian_removal_act_desc: "A bright future awaits the Indians we have graciously offered reservations to the west, out of our way. With smiles shall they march along, merrily humming their favorite patriotic tunes."
 usa_gilded_valley_title: "Gilded Valley"
 usa_gilded_valley_desc: "Tales of glittering gold have come in from the west. Regardless of whether these rumors are true, word of mouth has led to thousands of migrants flocking to the frontier... exactly what we needed. With the new incentive to go west, we can expedite the settlement process."
 usa_gold_rush_title: "GOLD RUSH"
 usa_gold_rush_desc: "OKAY SO IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS ACTUALLY GOLD IN CALIFORNIA! YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, BOYS!"
 usa_independence_day_title: "Independence Day"
 usa_independence_day_desc: "This day marks our valiant revolution against the overbearing monarchists of the Old World. With the signign of the Declaration of Independence, wee shall stake our claim in this new land--our heartland-- and proclaim the new Grand Republic of America!"
 usa_building_a_nation_title: "Building a Nation"
 usa_building_a_nation_desc: "Quite frankly, this sort of thing has never happened before. A nation has risen from the bountiful wastes of a New Land, and it is a true powerhouse. Before we galavant across the lands, we must first establish ourselves as a true nation with a strong foundation."
 usa_greater_than_thirteen_title: "Greater than Thirteen"
 usa_greater_than_thirteen_desc: "The bountiful lands of America call to us; the time has come to push west in search of additional land. Great farms shall pop up across the union, grand armies of America shall march from east to west. America rules the land and waves!"
 usa_manifest_destiny_title: "Manifest Destiny"
 usa_manifest_destiny_desc: "Recent expeditions west show clear and concise evidence of a Western Seaboard fit for commerce. As settlers flock past the Appalachians, we need a final destination for these brave men and women to aim for. In the meantime, let's make steady progress westward."
 usa_mexican_standoff_title: "Mexican Standoff"
 usa_mexican_standoff_desc: "Ambiguous claims and waning Papal Authority lead us to believe the precious lands of Mexico are ripe for the plucking. While we can't get away with complete annexation, the northern people of Texas seem to have pro-American sympathies."
 usa_californian_compromise_title: "Californian Compromise"
 usa_californian_compromise_desc: "California, in its entirety, is quite the extensive territory to fully integrate into our union. That being said, if we have the necessary resources, we should certainly give it our all and plunge into a Mexican contested territory."
 usa_a_western_gateway_title: "A Western Gateway"
 usa_a_western_gateway_desc: "As the politics of Eastern Asia dissolve into madness, idealistic young men and women come to our shores to escape the anarchy. We will offer them sanctuary and much more. In the city of San Francisco, we will erect a bridge of golden gates to welcome our new patriots!"
 usa_beacon_of_democracy_title: "Beacon of Democracy"
 usa_beacon_of_democracy_desc: "We have conquered waste and native; we have toilet 'till our backs have broken beneath the burden of liberty. But yet we have perservered, showing our tenacity, dedication, and pure, unadulterated spirit, born of struggle and molded into a beautiful display of passion as we stake our claim upon the world. We have shifted the center of the world to us; now we must keep it."
 usa_expel_the_invaders_title: "Expel the Invaders"
 usa_expel_the_invaders_desc: "European occupation of the American Continent has gone on long enough. They have plundered its resources, sapped its soil, and slaughtered its natives. We cannot let these unlawful acts go on!"
 usa_monroe_doctrine_title: "Monroe Doctrine"
 usa_monroe_doctrine_desc: "With the Age of Imperialism waning, it is our duty to put the final nail in the colonial coffin. We are a global power, a global hegemon, and a global peacekeeper. We shall keep the peace in our own way at our own pace, where we see fit and how we see fit. No more asking for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for you: ring-a-ding-ding bitches."
 usa_safeguard_settlers_title: "Safeguard Settlers"
 usa_safeguard_settlers_desc: "Our authority across the western border is loose at best. As savages continue to raid our settlers, we have done naught but twiddle our thumbs, idly watching. No more shall we be complacent to their deaths."
 usa_the_white_house_title: "The White House"
 usa_the_white_house_desc: "We must follow precedent and erect a grand estate in which the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the United States of America may reside. Though it will be costly, we can rest assured that such a building will inspire our people and allow the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to do what he does best: lead."
 usa_reconnect_with_the_west_title: "Reconnect with the West"
 usa_reconnect_with_the_west_desc: "Despite our swift break from the Western World, relations have not deteriorated to the point of no return. We are adrift in a hostile world without an ally to our name. Perhaps the Great Powers of Europe would be open to diplomatic talks."
 usa_boston_harbor_title: "The Boston Harbor"
 usa_boston_harbor_desc: "Perhaps the most integral outlet into the great Atlantic is the Boston Harbor, leading into the Masaschussets Bay. Should we invest the proper resources into developing this natural harbor, we could expand our influence across the seas."
 usa_hudson_bay_port_title: "Hudson Bay Port"
 usa_hudson_bay_port_desc: "Once known as the Mouth of the New World, the Hudson River has served as the primary trading port for our trade with Europe for many years. It's about time that we revitalized the commercial district of Manhattan to bring in additional merchants."
 usa_the_inland_trade_title: "The Inland Trade"
 usa_the_inland_trade_desc: "Despite our most developed locales remaining contentrated on the coast, the majority of our trade goods come from the inland. Furs, lumber, and metal all require extensive effort to transport to the coast for exportation. We shall put in this effort in the stead of American entrepeneurs."
 usa_continental_canals_title: "Continental Canals"
 usa_continental_canals_desc: "As caravans and footwork grow outdated, we are expected to provide additional methods of overland transport. Thankfully, overland does not necessarily mean over land. Canals provide a splendid alternative to roads and require far less upkeep. We need but put in the effort to dig such a system."
 usa_new_orleans_outpost_title: "New Orleans Outpost"
 usa_new_orleans_outpost_desc: "Resting at the nape of the Mississipi, New Orleans has incredible potential as a Caribbean trading port, allowing inland merchants access to Trans-Atlantic commerce. Our perogative must be to foster this valuable city."
 usa_continental_railroad_title: "Continental Railroad"
 usa_continental_railroad_desc: "Upon the fires of the revolution lies a monumental burden, one which we have delayed for long enough. We must open the possibility of transport from one end of the continent to the other within a month. Such a feat, though seemingly impossible, can be achieved through railroads and the sweat of our workers."
 usa_market_economy_title: "Market Economy"
 usa_market_economy_desc: "We have worked under the guise of a free government, but still condone dreadful mercantilist policies. No more shall we allow such restrictive measures to continue. We will become a true market economy, free of extensive tariffs and redundant taxes."
 usa_the_continental_navy_title: "Continental Navy"
 usa_the_continental_navy_desc: "The days of [GBR.GetAdjective] naval dominance are at their end! Bombs may burst upon our ships, but only to give proof that our flag is still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave o'er the land of the free and home of the brave?"
 usa_naval_station_newport_title: "Naval Station Newport"
 usa_naval_station_newport_desc: "We cannot afford to allow the [GBR.GetAdjective] dominance of the seas. To safeguard ourselves and our countrymen, we must establish continental infrastructure to support the brave sailors of the Atlantic. A grand shipyard shall be constructed in Rhode Island to offer ourselves that protection."
 usa_the_american_navy_title: "The American Navy"
 usa_the_american_navy_desc: "Whilst the Britons boast their dominion of the waves, lounging in sloth, we will send waves of oaken terrors to contest their reign. Who truly rules the seas?"
 usa_found_the_coast_guard_title: "Found the Coast Guard"
 usa_found_the_coast_guard_desc: "Despite centralization and civilizing efforts, the coast remains wracked with piracy and other fiendish crimes. The time has come to create an offshoot of the American navy, one which will defend the shores in the event of such raids."
 usa_a_new_revolution_title: "A New Revolution"
 usa_a_new_revolution_desc: "As a new sensation sweeps Europe, America is being left in the smoke-stained dust of their complicated machinations of industry. No more shall we toil in the obscurities of this world; industrialism awaits!"
 usa_fuel_the_fires_title: "Fuel the Fires"
 usa_fuel_the_fires_desc: "A quite literal title to a quite pragmatic mission. As the smokestacks of the industrial revolution fly high, our capacity for innovation is being throttled by a lack of raw resources, namely coal."
 usa_build_manufactories_title: "Build Manufactories"
 usa_build_manufactories_desc: "Resources without cause simply go to waste. The same holds true for labor. Unless we direct these two things to a common cause, we risk falling behind our competitors in industrialization."

 ME_USA_Events.EVTNAME4: "The Navajo Reservation"
 ME_USA_Events.EVTDESC4: "The time has come to grant the Navajo people a home to call their own. Their ancestral homeland is of no value to us, and thus we will offer it to them in exchange for their loyalty. Should the time come to pass, we could certainly go back on this offer..."

 usa_second_thoughts_title: "Second Thoughts"
 usa_second_thoughts_desc: "It has come to light that the Navajo reserve we recently established was, in fact, host to valuable resources.

Because, of course, our cause is just."
 usa_expand_the_frontier_title: "Expand the Frontier"
