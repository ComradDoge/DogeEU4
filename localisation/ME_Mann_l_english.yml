 ME_Mann_Events.1.t: "Reuniting Kingdom of the Isles"
 ME_Mann_Events.1.d: "In olden days, the Hebrides and Mann used to be ruled by powerful Norse-Gaelic kings who would inspire much power and respect despite the harsh and rather barren territories that they ruled. Though it may seem as those times are long gone, the recent conquests [Root.GetName] might usher in a new era for such entity. The ceremony has already planned out and [Root.Monarch.GetName] is becoming the King of the Isles."
 ME_Mann_Events.1.a: "Who says the islanders can't be kings?"

 ME_Mann_Events.2.t: "Calls from the West"
 ME_Mann_Events.2.d: "There certainly are territories to our west.\n\nThough this sentence may have seemed insane a decade ago, today it is far more reasonable. We have received serious reports that other European powers have discovered empty territories beyond those vast, dangerous oceans. This has inspired fervor in some of our Nobles and Burghers, who are eager to seek fortune no matter how far from home it would be. Many have already called for an immediate expedition,  no matter how preemptive and foolish it may be."
 ME_Mann_Events.2.a: "We depart at daybreak!"
 ME_Mann_Events.2.b: "Maybe not."

 ME_Mann_Events.3.t: "Oath of the Highlanders"
 ME_Mann_Events.3.d: "The allegiance of the Highland clans could never be ensured, even by the Scottish Kings. This is why, we have forced the local clans to swear a somewhat humiliating oath to us. That event will separate the loyal clansmen from traitors whose treachery will be punished and rooted out. Those who respect our rule will be adequately rewarded. It is worth remarking that after the ceremony, the clansmen of dubious 'priorities' have made themselves quite clear as to who they truly answer to.\n\nThey will be dealt with."
 ME_Mann_Events.3.a: "And then everything will be as it should be!"

 ME_Mann_Events.4.t: "Submission of the Brehons"
 ME_Mann_Events.4.d: "As our conquests in Ireland are solidified and the last remaining clans are subdued, fewer and fewer nobles profess the ability and will to organize resistance. In this case, even the local Brehons - irish-gaelic jurists and judges - are beginning to study the laws governing in the lands of the conquerors - they are beginning to realize that we shall not retreat and go back on our conquests. Why would we even consider that? After all, our claims are backed by real documents."
 ME_Mann_Events.4.a: "It is a lawful conquest..."

 ME_Mann_Events.5.t: "Claiming the North Sea"
 ME_Mann_Events.5.d: "Our tiny state has grown remarkably. Besides our takeover of England, we have also seized much of lands across the North Sea, essentially conquering the North Sea itself. A new era shines upon our nation and many nobles are beginning to call back to our past to enhance their prestige. Perhaps, we ought to do so too.
 ME_Mann_Events.5.a: "Rise, The North Sea Empire!"
 ME_Mann_Events.5.b: "We are the imperium of Man!"
 ME_Mann_Events.5.c: "We need no new names."

 ME_Mann_Events.6.t: "Fall of the Norman England"
 ME_Mann_Events.6.d: "The Kingdom of England used to be the least british state in British isles. With much of their culture derived from their peers across the sea, we could not even imagine the consideration of them ruling over us. It is rather natural then, that our paths would cause and a war would erupt. And war did erupt, leaving many dead in its dawn. But now, after intense feuds with the English, we can finally claim our glorious victory."
 ME_Mann_Events.6.a: "We won't be ruled by Stanleys!"

 ME_Mann_Events.7.t: "Focusing on Raiding"
 ME_Mann_Events.7.d: "With our trusty Birlinns and the intention to raid very much present, a choice of a new kind of doctrine is upon us. Utilizing our galleys to conduct raids in further territories has become a strategic possibility, albeit less efficient and certainly more risky. However, bringing up the successes of the Vikings, many call for such an approach."
 ME_Mann_Events.7.a: "We must go as far as the Vikings did!"
 ME_Mann_Events.7.b: "We need to focus on localized targets in Northern Europe."

 ME_Mann_Events.8.t: "Dubh's Rebellion"
 ME_Mann_Events.8.d: "One of the members of clan Donald, a man so called 'Dubh' has organized a rebellion in his ancestral territory - the Kingdom of the Isles. Trying to win back his territory, leading an army of relatively few yet very brave and motivated men, he is now in an open rebellion against us. May Lord have mercy on his soul for his betrayal and spares him from the painful death we will deliver him in due time."
 ME_Mann_Events.8.a: "Damnation be upon him, actually!"

 ME_Mann_Events.9.t: "A Colonial Era"
 ME_Mann_Events.9.d: "It is clear that the future of the World belongs to those who can claim the weak and unexplored territories for themselves. In this spirit, a new interest group has formed out of various investors, calling for exploration and establishment of settlement in the brave unknown. We shall see if we heed their advice. "
 ME_Mann_Events.9.a: "The islands beyond ours shall be ours!"
