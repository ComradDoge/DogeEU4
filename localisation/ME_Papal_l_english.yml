 ME_pap_mercenaries_desc:0 "Italy is a land of many a man who will fight for whomever can provide the most gold.

 ME_pap_south_italy_bases_title:0 "Strengthen Italian Ports"
 ME_pap_south_italy_bases_desc:0 "Italy, and especially its' lands in the South, has a long maritime and trading tradition, which has left many a port in our possession as we assert our authority in Italia.

 ME_pap_renaissance_title:0 "Renaissance Papacy"
 ME_pap_renaissance_desc:0 "With the resurgence of interest in the old and the rise in interest in the new, the Vatican must keep up and innovate on itself. Whilst many are either rediscovering old documents or crafting new ones as they investigate the divine clockwork of the world, we have long had a disorganized mess of enlightening documents, with books and records spread from Rome to Avignon to elsewhere. This cannot do if we want to revitalize Rome, for a disorganized mess of documents is a disorganized mess that no scholar will use! Let us bring all these works together, and source some more from across Europe, including long-shunned pagan works, and establish a truly marvellous center of knowledge in Rome, so that any scholar will know that we are to be trusted with the knowledge of the world."

 ME_pap_religious_zeal_title:0 "Taking Up the Torch"
 ME_pap_religious_zeal_desc:0 "Despite the Pope having great temporal power, he has often needed a secular vanguard in order to truly enforce his infailable doctrine. Whilst this has traditionally been the Holy Roman Empire, under the Emperors we have long coronated, presently [emperor.Monarch.GetName] [emperor.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], they have grown disloyal, and with their lands being the cesspit from which ideas of Reformation have largely stemmed from, that unholy den will soon grow to be but a liability.

 ME_pap_papal_guard_desc:0 "Whilst the Papacy holds great temporal power, it in reality holds very little power of it's own, with barely an army to it's name and revenues constricted to whatever the fiefs of the Holy See contribute with our temporal powers no longer bringing in the wealth they once did. If we intend to expand not only our temporal power, but our secular power, we must begin to prepare ourselves for battle by financing an army truly under Papal control. Luckily, there are many a man abroad and at home who would be willing to fight for the Bishop of Rome..."

 ME_pap_fall_of_naples_desc:0 "The mainland of the long-divided Kingdom of Sicily, known as the Kingdom of Naples, has long been a pawn of French and Spanish politics. When Manfred von Hohenstaufen, bastard son of the Anti-Christ Frederick II, took the throne of Sicily long ago, we personally supported Charles I de Anjou in ousting that dastardly house from our south, whilst claiming Naples as our de jure fief. However, the Angevins never respected our rightful suzerainity, and the Aragonese ousted them in 1443 after centuries of undermining their rule given to them by God.\n\nNow, the Aragonese prop up their own bastard son on the throne of Naples! This cannot stand, we must march south and install our own government in Napoli at once, for it seems nobody but us can truly get the job done."

 ME_pap_avignon_title:0 "Fate of Avignon"
 ME_pap_avignon_desc:0 "When Alphonse, Count of Poitiers and de jure ruler of the Comtat Venaissin as Count of Provence, died in 1271, he granted his wife's, Joan of Toulouse, land to the Holy See during disputes regarding how his succession should go due to Alphonse having no male heirs. The French kings and Parlement of Paris acted to prevent Joan from asserting her will, in which she granted all her lands to her closest relative, Phillipa de Lomagne, in order to enforce the reversion of all her lands to the Royal Domain, but these institutions did not dispute our rightful grant of Avignon and the lands around it. This would become relevant as Clement V would move the Papacy to these lands in 1309, starting the Western Schism.\n\nNow, the ashes of this schism have begun to blow away, yet we still hold de jure French territory. It is only a matter of time before this becomes a sticking point between us and the Daughter of the Church, so let us make our move before they do."

 ME_pap_council_of_trent_desc:0 "Calls for reformation within the Catholic Church have become rampant due to so-called 'abuses', and this now tears all of Europe asunder as Lutherans, Calvinists, and Catholics fight eachother time and time again. Attempts at appeasing these calls for reform, even before Martin Luther caused them to sperad like wildfire, have typically been left to die due to no man in a position of power being willing to do any amount of compromise. If we wish to counter the Reformation in any form, we must engage in a Counter-Reformation and codify our stance, regardless of if the Cardinals oppose it.\n\nAs the main force of this Counter-Reformation, we would be best to convene a council regardless of prior controversies regarding the authority of councils compared to the Papacy, though, of course, we could just issue a Papal Bull codifying our stance regard;ess of temporal or secular support..."

 ME_pap_rebuild_naples_desc:0 "With the fall of Napoli to us, we have inherited many of the issues the Kingdom of Naples once had, but have also stumbled into a brand new issue: neglect. With our center of power being in Roma, our southern lands have grown to feel neglected, with the governor of the lands demanding that we pay some attention to their woes, since, after all, Naples is amongst our most prosperous and wealthy regions, despite our administrative failures.

Jerusalem, Antioch, Tripoli, and Eddessa have all fallen, and instead pf properly reclaiming them, crusades ground to a halt in the Maghreb and burned Constantinople into many feuding states.\n\nHowever, now that we've restored some semblance of might and power, it is time we start looking to the remnants of these holy wars and supporting their efforts, integrating them into the Papal fold."

 ME_pap_central_italy_title:0 "Consolidating Northern Italy"

Ferrara, whom is meant to bow to us, has grown independent and ambitious. Genoa, whom seeks to claim the trade of Italy for itself, has become the target of aggression from all it's neighbors and foreign powers. Milan, a growing power ever since the collapse of the Duchy of Lombardy, has found itself being torn apart between claims of France, Austria, Aragon, Savoy, Venice, rouge mercenaries, and even relatives of the Pope himself such as in the case of Parma. We, as the head of the Church, must quell this needless chaos... in our favor."

 ME_pap_kog_title:0 "Kingdom of God"

With our grip over Italy growing secure, it is time that our secular power matches our temporal power, that the lords of Europe bow down as they once did, and that we are respected for what we truly are: the Kingdom of God on Earth! It is time that we forge our own destiny!"

 ME_pap_latinokratia_desc:0 "When the Crusaders, unpaid and undersupplied, brought down the heretical Byzantines in 1204, we were quick to cooperate with them and Venice to establish a Catholic Empire in Rhomania's place. This Empire, long fell by the swords of Nicaea, has become known as the Latinokratia, aka the rule of the Latins. Whilst this empire has fallen, and attempts to make the Byzantine Emperors convert to the true faith have failed due to their own rebellious clergy and nobles, we now have the ability to take things in our own hands as we assert our authority in the Aegean.\n\nConstantinople shall fall once more, not to the Turks, but to the Holy See!"

 ME_pap_caliph_title:0 "Fate of Islam"
 ME_pap_caliph_desc:0 "With the crusades under the banner of the Bishop of Rome having shattered the will of the remaining heathens, surely doubts have begun to arise within them about the words of their prophets, for surely their God, be they Allah or any other false idol, would not have allowed our forces to have put them to the sword. As such, factions within the Vatican have begun suggesting that we use our newfound prestige and influence to take the Crusades into a new dimension; why must we put the Sacreans to the sword, when we can attempt to convince them to abandon their apostasy of ages long gone through the pen instead by capturing the Caliph and using them as our puppet?\n\nSurely, if they refuse, we can just continue what we have been doing regardless, so why not take a page out of the book of the Habsburgs?"

 ME_pap_nepotism_title:0 "Nepotism"
 ME_pap_nepotism_desc:0 "Due to the title of Pope not being herditary as is the standard in much of Europe under the institution of monarchy, any Pope seeking power for himself and his kin must engage in more indirect ways to spread their influence. As such, many a noble house, and even the Popes themselves, have actively began to put their own kin in positions of high authority, primarily that of Cardinals. However, despite this, influence is arguably still shattered amongst all those attempting to lay their claim to their share of the pie.\n\nLet us intensify putting our own kin into positions of great importance within the Church as to ensure that a dynasty of Popes can truly crowd out any rivals, be they wanting to lay claim to the Holy See itself or just merely establish a series of puppets within the College of Cardinals."

 ME_pap_papal_army_title:0 "Reform the Guard"
 ME_pap_papal_army_desc:0 "Whilst there are already small militias that serve the Pope directly, these militias will be of little use if they stay as disorganized as they are now. An army solely consisting of clergymen and mercenaries of numerous origins is an army with many cracks in it, after all. As such, let us build up our military infrastructure and begin to seriously expand on our efforts to expand and consolidate the Pope's personal guard as to ensure a loyal and disciplined army may emerge in the near future."

 ME_pap_swiss_guard_title:0 "Forming the Swiss Guard"
 ME_pap_swiss_guard_desc:0 "The men of the Swiss Confederacy have begun to repeatedly prove themselves as well-versed in the art of mercenary warfare, with their involvement in many a war signaling the change of said war's tide. They have already fought in the Hundred Years' War, fended off the Habsburgs, and pierced the Burgundians, striking the fear of the pike into many. As such, given our existing ties to these fledging city states in loose allegance to eachother, perhaps we could work to bring these brave men into our military, especially in the personal forces of the Pope himself. With this, we shall strike fear into all those who oppose us!"

 ME_pap_florence_rivalry_desc:0 "With the Popes all deriving from different parts and houses of Italy, many a house seeks to plant its' own member in the Holy See. At present, this has lead to tensions with the Medici family, who seek to put their own into the Papacy and who have antagonized the Venetians, Lombards, and Genoese.

Be it the Caliphates, the Fatimids, the Ayyubids, or the Mamluks, these heathens have no respect for the Gospel, despite what they may claim about their own views on our lord and savior as a prophet or messiah. After all, we keep recieving reports of them obstructing pligrims, and surely these are all true.\n\nWe have called for many a Crusade to retake and secure the Holy City, but despite intital success, these crusades have all but failed ultimately, with the Crusader forces exiled to island strongholds. If this is what happens when we rely on men devoted to us, then it's time we take matters in our own hands and do it ourselves."

 ME_pap_egypt_title:0 "Prince of Egypt"
 ME_pap_egypt_desc:0 "Egypt has long been a center of Islam ever since it fell to the Rashidun Caliphate and, later, since it became the lands from which the Abbasid Caliphs were effectively held captive. However, this has not always been the status quo, with Egypt being among the first regions to convert to the word of Christ, and with a sizable Christian minority persisting in the region to this day. Whenever crusaders have fought to restore Christian rule in the Holy Land, those who rule in Egypt have always opposed it and put them to the sword. As such, let us end this threat once and for all by sweeping along the Nile ourselves!"

 ME_pap_papal_treasury_title:0 "Apostolic Camera"
 ME_pap_papal_treasury_desc:0 "The Apostolic Camera has long been an important position within the Vatican, as he who serves in this office helps to manage the finances that go into spreading the word of Christ and ensuring that the Lord's work be done. However, the board is still relatively weak in power compared to the rapidly growing needs of the increasingly absolutist-minded Popes, and this has proven time and time again to hold us and our ambitions back.\n\nLet us continue the trend of empowerment with this board of accountants and treasurers and establish them as among the most important and influential advisors of the Church and the Holy See."

 ME_pap_basilica_title:0 "Honoring Saint Peter"
 ME_pap_basilica_desc:0 "Saint Peter, born a Jewish fisherman from Gaille, became one of Christ's twelve apostles, and founded the Church of Antioch, and more importantly, the Catholic Church. It was Christ who promised Peter the position of the Papacy, and as such, it is Saint Peter who is the first in the long line of Popes who have presided over all of Christendom from Rome, despite Peter's cruxification in Rome.\n\nA series of building named after him have long stood in Rome as the site of Papal coronations, built by Constantine I, but these buildings have been neglected during the Avignon Papacy, and as such, their age has caught up with them. With new ideas in the arts and new funds, however, we can do much better than our precedessors and craft a truly wonderous basilica to honor Saint Peter and to show to the world the prosperity of the Holy See."

This brings great income into the Vatican, given that these pilgrims, seeking indulgence, often donate great amounts to the church. However, this has also oftentimes filled to the brim, and sometimes evne over it, despite efforts to permit shorter pilgrimages, leading to instances of death by trampling.\n\nWith how profitable this is, it should be a shame if it were ruined by the loss of some faithful.

In fact, it was in this city that the term Christian first emerged, a term now used to describe the followers of the Bible.\n\nHowever, the city has long fallen to forces following the word of Allah, and despite the best efforts of the Crusades, under which the Principality of Antioch was established by Bohemond I in 1098, Antioch has once again fallen to followers of Muhammad, namely, the Mamluks whom rule over Egypt. We must strive to reclaim the cradle of Christianity, and one of the Patriachates of old, in order to prove to the world that the followers of the Pope will no longer stand by and let others trample over our holy sites!"

 ME_pap_mesopotamia_desc:0 "With the sword of Christendom having cut through much of the Holy Land and the nearby coasts, one of the holiest cities in the faith of the Sacraens, Baghdad, has emerged upon the horizon for many a crusader to see. It was from here that the Abbasids were centered for much of their reign, and that the Islamic Golden Age was born and spread across the Orient. However, Baghdad has seen better days, with it having been left in poor straits after the brutal Mongols looted the city for days on end due to it's refusal to surrender.\n\nNow, it is time that we take Baghdad and what little remains of its' wealth for ourselves, for surely we would be better protectors of this great city than those who have failed once before?"

Mecca is where Muhammad was born and is where the Kaaba, the holiest mosque in all of Islam believed to be the first House of Worship for mankind, is housed, whilst Medina is from where his conquests began and Islam began its' spread across the Levant. Naturally, these are symbols of resiliance amongst the Muslims in the face of our holy mission, so, in order to put the nail into the coffin that is the false prophet's teachings, we must turn these cities from centers of Islam into towns following the Gospel of Jesus Christ."

Religious orders, bishops, and priests all over already enrich themselves through this abuse, and despite the attempts of our precedessors to curb the abuses, these have failed. Now, the matter is becoming an issue of controversy as more lowly men see this as sinful behavior in and of itself.

This cannot stand, for any truly state of God would be having these men as a core part of its' government!

We have been forced to expand inwards and outwards to counteract this lack of revenues, angering many a soul, but we never considered raising the taxes of indulgences, for surely this would have angered many more souls than our aggression ever would.\n\nHowever, now, with our days of expansion slowly reaching their peak, perhaps it is time we reconsider our stance on the indulgence tax. Why not increase the taxes levied upon those who sin more than their worth, and increase the bottom line of the truly pious? After all, we deserve our share for all the... 'pious work'... we do."

 ME_pap_french_economic_aid_title:0 "A Mutual Benefit"
 ME_pap_french_economic_aid_desc:0 "Both us and our French allies have our own respective economic struggles, largely due to the same issue: autonomous and disloyal fiefdoms depriving us of our rightful revenues. This is an issue both of us have to constantly work around. However, despite this, both of us have access to great sources of revenue as our lands and claims align with some of the most prosperous regions in all of Europe. As such, we must endeavor to build up our own economic base by asserting our control over the trade of Italy and using the revenues from our merchants to establish a mutual relationship of economic aid with the Daughter of the Church."

 ME_pap_move_palace_of_popes_title: "Reclaiming the Pope's Palace"
 ME_pap_move_palace_of_popes_desc: "When we gave Avignon to the Royal Domain of France as a token of good will, we had to give up the Palace of the Popes, our residence in Avignon and a symbol of Papal prosperity. Whilst we have grown prosperous without this old palace and have built Rome into a magnificent city truly worthy of the title of the Eternal City, the Vatican ultimately feels somewhat lacking without this symbol of our prosperity. France, luckily, doesn't seem to have much use for the slowly decaying palace, and with technology advancing, means of perhaps deconstructing the Palace in Avignon and restoring it within the Vatican have become viable...\n\nPerhaps we could ask the Roi to move the Palace of the Popes to [Root.Capital.GetName]?"

 ME_pap_crusader_marches_title: "Vassalizing the Orders"
 ME_pap_crusader_marches_desc: "The various Holy Orders and Crusader States of Europe and the Levant have always de jure been under our suzerainity, but none of them have ever respected that, with the Teutonic Order and the Crusader States of the Levant always having merely paid lip service to his holiness. Ungrateful and shortsighted these holy men have proven to be, and that has gotten them dismembered and dissolved by either the enemies of Christ or the secular kings who have to put up with their zealous violence. No more. With the might of the Vatican truly established as a forminable force, it is time we show these men who their true overlord is, and establish those who are loyal to us as soveriegns of their own fiefdoms."

 ME_pap_control_of_churches_title: "Control the Churches"
 ME_pap_control_of_churches_desc: "Despite our position as the head of the Catholic Church, the individual churches of the faith are only loosely tied to the Papacy through bishops and cardinals. As such, any Papal Bull requires more effort than it really ought to require to actually enforce its' contents, and any corrupt deacon or priest can do unspeakable deeds in the name of God. We must cement our rightful authority over every church of God, ensure that that each and every Papal legate bows only to the Holy See, and control the churches truly and surely."

 ME_pap_warrior_popes_title: "The Warrior Popes"
 ME_pap_warrior_popes_desc: "Long ago, Julius Caesar conquered Gaul, and laid the groundwork for the territorial height of the Roman Empire. Even now, his name is used to specify men of great importance, with the words Kaiser and Czar still being used amongst powerful Christian rulers to indicate their might. This, naturally, has also set a precedent amongst the Papacy, with many Popes having taken notes from his successes, and the rare Pope even breaking convention and naming themselves after thee.\n\nThis, however, has led to the title of the 'Warrior Pope' becoming increasingly commonplace. Let us embrace this reputation, for surely sin of the Popes is no sin at all, after all, we can just excuse it."

 ME_pap_grand_crusades_title: "Grand Crusades"
 ME_pap_grand_crusades_desc: "As times change, so do the norms of society. As has happened to many traditions, the concept of crusade has itself also decayed into borderline irrelevance as religion grows less influential in the secular politics of Europe. This, however, has not been helped by the refusal of many of the kingdoms, duchies, and counties of Europe to do much to assist any crusades after the failure of the Third Crusade against the Ayyubids, despite the time for crusade arguably becoming more and more ripe and needed as time passes with the Turkish state expanding throughout both the Islamic world and the Christian world.\n\nNo more. With Catholicism's influence in Europe reasserted with the declaration of the Kingdom of God and our assistance of the remaining Crusaders, let us establish a unified front and begin a brand new era of crusade, one of grand crusades with full-hearted involvement of the Christian states of Europe."

 ME_pap_militarization_title: "Religious Militarization"
 ME_pap_militarization_desc: "We have come to realize in recent times that only might can truly enforce and spread the true faith of Christ, and expand the Kingdom of God on Earth across the world. However, despite this realization, we have yet to truly invest in our military capacities, and for this, we have already paid despite our great strides in Italy and abroad. We must work to establish an integral military character to the realm of the Holy See, as to better facilitate our ongoing clashes with the heathens on the boundaries of our known world."

 ME_pap_eternal_crusade_title: "Eternal Crusade"
 ME_pap_eternal_crusade_desc: "There will always be a heathen somewhere that refuse to accept the true lord and savior, someone who will only understand the path to true salvation by being put at the end of a sword. Whilst the Crusades of old have largely ended in failure, and we have had to clean up their messes in recent times, it is only a matter of time before crusaders descend upon the Sacraens once more, but directly under our banner instead of under shortsighted lords.\n\nAs such, let us extend the next Crusade into ad perpetuum and show all of Earth the sword of Christ."

 ME_pap_overseas_missions_title: "Overseas Missions"
 ME_pap_overseas_missions_desc: "In recent times, more of the world has become known than ever before, and as a result, communication has become easier and easier between parts of the world continents apart. As such, we have grown aware of the heathen beliefs of the rest of the world, from the pagans of the Americas to the beliefs of the Chinese. Much of this work detailing their beliefs and doctrines has been devised by missionaries nominally supported by us, who seek to figure out the best ways to make these heathens see the error of their ways. However, they say that they feel undersupported, and state that they cannot feasibly engage in missionary work on such scales without an equally sizable backing, preferably from the Holy See.\n\nLet us support these men in their efforts overseas to convert the masses to the word of Christ!"

 ME_pap_word_of_god_title: "Spreading Jesus' Words"
 ME_pap_word_of_god_desc: "A vast network of missionaries has been established with our patronage, and this has already begun to make waves in the farthest reaches of the world, such as Cathay and the Indies. However, we must continue our patronage in order to save these damned men from the depths of hell, for only the word of Jesus, our lord and savior, can save these men who have great potential if only they accept our preaching. As such, let us continue to establish missionary efforts all across the world, in order to ensure that the words of Christ will be spread far and wide."

 ME_pap_militarize_holy_orders_title: "Militarization of the Knights"
 ME_pap_militarize_holy_orders_desc: "Many an order of knights and theologians now reside within the Kingdom of God on Earth due to our patronage of them. However, despite this, they have not yet caught up to the present agenda and ambitions, focusing more on spreading the faith through the word and pen instead of through the sword and gun. They state that this is because they lack the resources to do so, and is not because they refuse to fight. Surely, these holy men are indeed in need of assistance in arming themselves and engaging in militarization. As such, let us build up our military as to militarize these knights in a fine fighting force that serves the Holy See, and through such, God."

 ME_pap_holy_orders_for_all_title: "Aid Catholicism"
 ME_pap_holy_orders_for_all_desc: "A leader is only as good as their ability to lead and help those under their command. This, as much as it holds true for secular rulers, holds true also for the Papacy, for we are the leaders of western Christendom as much as the King of France leads the French and the Holy Roman Emperor rules over the Germans. Yet we have still a gap in our assistance of our fellow bretheren, largely due to a lack of resources, but also due to a sheer unwillingness on our part.\n\nWe must work with our flock as the shepherd of Christendom in order to steer them on the right path and to establish a truly holy order in Europe once and for all."

 #Events:
 ME_Papal_Events.1.t: "Fall of Napoli"
 ME_Papal_Events.1.d: "Napoli has fallen to Papal forces at last, putting an end to one of the Holy See's greatest threats in Italia. With this comes great wealth and power, but also a troubling matter: how we are to treat the city, and by extension, the kingdom we have brought down by our own might. With most of the supporters of the old King gone, and our new administrator, a nephew of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], taking power, one must ask about the fate of the wealth left behind.\n\nWe could use the palace of the former Kings to house our new governor and as a symbol of our new-found prosperity, or we could give no quarter and at last extract the dues the Kings of Naples and Sicily have refused to pay... by force."
 ME_Papal_Events.1.a: "Maintain the Palace"
 ME_Papal_Events.1.b: "We are only here for the money"

 ME_Papal_Events.2.t: "Tuscan Banking"
 ME_Papal_Events.2.d: "Tuscany, especially Florence, has a reputation for being amongst the best bankers in all of Europe, with the House of Medici's own bank having brought many innovations to the profession such as the double entry system. So powerful has this industry been that they have brought the actual rulers of Florence to their knees and become the de facto rulers of the entire state, and they have spread their reach far and wide, even establishing branches as far flung as Bruges and our enclave in Avignon.\n\nNow that Tuscany bows to us, we now inherit this tradition and industry. Whilst we have an unstable relationship with the Medicis, we must end up working with them in some way to assert our authority in Tuscany, as to avoid a potential rebellious fiefdom forming. Shall we establish a friendly relationship with them, in essence establishing a branch of the Medici Bank in [Root.Capital.GetName], or shall we extract their wealth for ourselves?"
 ME_Papal_Events.2.a: "Invite some of the bankers to our capital"
 ME_Papal_Events.2.b: "Exploit their banks instead"

 ME_Papal_Events.4.t:0 "In Hell We Live, Lament"
 ME_Papal_Events.4.d: "The practice of indulgences has grown to be rampantly abused in the years since the rise of the Papacy as a force of its' own on the European stage, with everyone from crusader orders to lowly priests to bishops to cardinals all beginning to sell, what is, in essence, a get out of purgatory card. Whilst this was meant to support charities, it has rapidly become its' own institution bankrolling much of the clergy of Europe. This has caused some men to grow concerned about the holiness and integrity of the Catholic Church, and whilst this will likely become an issue in the future, the issue in the present is not notions of distant reform, but rather red in our ledgers.\n\nAlready, most of the bishoprics across the continent indulge in this practice, but the Papacy has mostly chosen to either ignore it or attempt to halt it. We could profit greatly off joining in on the practice ourselves, even if this would cause many to believe reform is even more needed. We could also just accept the status quo, or, if we are truly worried about heeretical thoughts that have so far been contained and are likely to remain so without a freak accident, we could start to crack down on the practice."
 ME_Papal_Events.4.a: "Only we will sell Indulgences!"
 ME_Papal_Events.4.b: "They are allowed, as long as we gain a share of the pie"
 ME_Papal_Events.4.c: "Ban the practise of Indulgence selling"
 ME_PAP_GAIN_FROM_YEARS_OF_INCOME: "We will gain ¤ §Y[buyer.FROM_years_of_income.GetValue]§! amount of ¤ whilst @PAP §Y[PAP.GetName]§! will get §Y[buyer.FROM_years_of_income2.GetValue]§! amount of ¤"
 
 ME_Papal_Events.6.t: "Return to the Holy City"
 ME_Papal_Events.6.d: "Jerusalem, the origin of Christ's ministry and the holiest city in all of Christendom, has at last been returned to being under Christian suzerainity. Now that we have secured a foothold in the Levant, we must make haste to decide how we shall adminster these lands and how we will secure these lands to not suffer the same humiliation as the Crusaders whom we trusted to do this job centuries ago.\n\nWe could fall back on the example of the old Crusader States and restore one of the remaining crusader forces to the Holy Land, but secure a more dependent relationship. We could also hold the lands directly as to prevent potentially suffering the same failures, but then we have to determine how to handle the heathen pligrims who also see the Holy Land as their faith's Holy Land. In that case, can we afford to purge all the followers of Muhammad from the land by force, or should we embrace the diversity of the pligrimages to Jerusalem... for a small fee to those who do not follow the word of our lord and savior?"
 ME_Papal_Events.6.a: "The Crusaders will now have their home back"
 ME_Papal_Events.6.b: "Let us celebrate this victory"
 ME_Papal_Events.6.c: "We may have reclaimed Jerusalem, but we must honor the other religions"

 ME_Papal_Events.7.t: "Fall of Egypt"
 ME_Papal_Events.7.d: "With the fall of Egypt to our forces, we have inherited a land of rich soil, and, more importantly, rich culture. Whilst these lands have long become tied to the culture of the Sacreans, their knowledge and expertise has stayed the same and has arguably grown with Egypt's ties to the Islamic Golden Age of old. Many a bishop within our administration is torn between integrating these talented men into our administration as to help build up our country, or if we should choose to simply prevent these men from holding any adminstrative or advisory role within our court, and force them all to repent by force."
 ME_Papal_Events.7.a: "Invite them to Italy"
 ME_Papal_Events.7.b: "Heathens have no place in our country"

 ME_Papal_Events.8.t: "Islam's Holy Cities"
 ME_Papal_Events.8.d: "The Holy Cities of Islam, and with them the Kaaba, has fallen to our forces and have been made to renounce the preaching of the false prophet Muhammad and acknowledge the finality of Jesus Christ the Messiah. With this, the cross has risen across the crescent, and now we hold the sites that many a heathen pilgrim strive for, but now detached from the original narratives and stories that gave these sites any meaning. As such, given the zealotry of much of those whom serve the Pope, doubts have risen regarding the neccesity of the prolonged tolerance of this pilgrimages, which always have the threat of becoming a cesspit of rebellious ideas amongst the conquered Arabs, whom may despise their loss of leadership despite their tolerant treatment in many lands we are suzerain over.\n\nAs such, we must determine the fate of the Kaaba, and, as such, the fate of the Muslim pilgrims who travel to these cities."
 ME_Papal_Events.8.a: "Allow pilgrims to freely enter them"
 ME_Papal_Events.8.b: "Let us replace the Kaaba with a Cathedral"

 ME_Papal_Events.9.t: "Ressurgence of the Latin Empire"
 ME_Papal_Events.9.d: "At last, Constantinople has fallen to our forces, with the true faith instead of any heresy or heathens prevailing in the rule of the City of the World's Desire. Now, with the smoldering ruins of Constantinople, looted for all it's worth, under our control, we must determine who shall rule in these lands. After all, we engaged in this campaign primarily in the name of restoring the rightful Latin Emperors to the city. However, the dynasties of old have mostly died out, and even if we could just elect a new crusader to the throne, we would profit more from just directly annexing Constantinople and basking in the glory of this achievement.\n\nShall we restore the rule of the Latins and Franks, or shall we hold the city outselves?"
 ME_Papal_Events.9.a: "Let the Latins return once more in Constantinople"
 ME_Papal_Events.9.b: "We will keep the land for ourselves"

 ME_Papal_Events.10.t: "A Demand From the Pope"
 ME_Papal_Events.10.d: "With our cordial relations with the Papacy comes a concern of our status within said relationship. We are de jure fiefs of the Holy See, and whilst we have been able to just simply ignore this before, the Holy See has grown more powerful in recent times, and our relations with the Holy See, which have protected us from oblivion, are at risk if we continue to simply ignore this fact. Shall we acknowledge this suzerainity at last, or will we stand on our own?"
 ME_Papal_Events.10.a: "We will become their vassals"
 ME_Papal_Events.10.b: "Never!"

 ME_Papal_Events.11.t: "The Pope's Demand"
 ME_Papal_Events.11.d: "With the fall of the Patriachate of Constantinople, the Catholic Orthodox Church has been thrown into turmoil. Whilst any of the Patriachs being removed and replaced hasn't been crippling before, those we lost before Constantinople were ultimately not the heart of our wider church, unlike the City of the World's Desire itself, and the Bishop of Rome seems intent to destroy the Patriarchate in it's entirety.\n\nNow, the Bishop of Rome has sent an ultimatum to all those who continue to refuse to acknowledge his self-coup of centuries ago; either bow down to the Holy See or face the sword of a reinvigorated Roman Catholic Church."
 ME_Papal_Events.11.d2: "With the capture of the Abbasid Caliph, the Sunni sect has been thrown into turmoil. Whilst the Caliph being captured would usually be crippling only for the country using him as a figurehead, the Pope, head of the Catholic Church, seems to have been inspired by our own usage of him as a figurehead and has used him to denounce all that which Muhammad, Seal of the Prophets and messenger to all men and jinn, has preached, in order to attempt to force our conversion away from the true faith.\n\nNow, we must either bow down to these misguided people of the book, or face the wrath of those who follow the Caliph's words regardless of his clear distress."
 ME_Papal_Events.11.a: "We will convert to Catholic"
 ME_Papal_Events.11.b: "Never!"

 ME_Papal_Events.12.t: "Moving the Pope's Palace"
 ME_Papal_Events.12.d: "The Palace of the Popes was built into a marvel by those Pope who chose to reside within Avignon, but, now that the Papacy has returned to Rome, and that the Holy See has returned Avignon to us, we have grown to have little use for this landmark, as no governor wishes to reside in Avignon, and despite Avignon's prosperity and clerical ties, it has not been truly reclaimed by any bishops in the region.\n\nHowever, the Popes in [PAP.Capital.GetName], who have proven to be reliable and trustworthy allies, have grown interested in their old residence once more, and have sent a request to our Roi, seeking to request that the Palace of the Popes be deconstructed brick by brick and plank by plank and relocated to [PAP.Capital.GetName], where it will be reconstructed by the finest artists of the Vatican. This plan would be quite expensive for us, as we would have to cover the costs of all those who'd have to be paid to systemically dismantle this palace, but the Pope promises to cover all costs they can..."
 ME_Papal_Events.12.a: "Whatever the Pope wishes"
 ME_Papal_Events.12.b: "We will keep the Palace"

 ME_Papal_Events.13.t: "Fate of Avignon"
 ME_Papal_Events.13.d: "With efforts to begin preparations for a potential collapse of French relations over the matter of Avignon underway, we are forced with a choice on how we are to handle the Comtat Venaissin, and, by virture of its' status, our relations with the Daughter of the Church.\n\nIf we hold onto the enclave, it is likely that eventually tensions will boil out and that France will move to seize the enclave. As such, in this case, we will have to take proactive action to bring the Daughter of the Church, who once gave us protection from the Lombards, under our control as a Papal fief. Meanwhile, we could cede these lands, and the wealth and investment within them, to the Rois of France, as a symbol of good will. This would surely help to stop the delusion of the French clergy and Parlements regarding that new-fabled ideal of Gallicanism."
 ME_Papal_Events.13.a: "Preview Alliance Branch"
 ME_Papal_Events.13.b: "Preview Conquest Branch"
 ME_Papal_Events.13.c: "Lock to current Branch"

 ME_Papal_Events.14.t: "A Port in Provence"
 ME_Papal_Events.14.d: "Provence, as the host of the Rhone Estuary, has a long history of importance in regards to French trade and maritime endeavors, and also a long history of wealth. Notably, Aix and Arles, cities who are of great importance in the past and present, are along the Rhone, and investing in them would assist us greatly in building up our French holdings. Meanwhile, we could siphon all the revenues of the Rhone to Avignon, as the viceroy now in charge of the wider region requests repeatedly."
 ME_Papal_Events.14.a: "Focus on Avignon"
 ME_Papal_Events.14.b: "Strengthen the Rhone Estuary instead"

 ME_Papal_Events.15.t: "Subduing the French People"
 ME_Papal_Events.15.d: "The Daughter of the Church has mostly fallen before the forces of the Holy See, but the administration the Rois and Princes of the Kingdom of France have established lingers on within our territories, alongside the innovations of the French before our proactive campaigns to protect our interests primarily regarding Avignon. As such, we must now work to integrate the ashes of the French Kingdom into our administration properly. Whilst we can surely appease the former Appanages by establishing them as fiefdoms and viceroys, perhaps the topic of more interest to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is what remains of the attempted military reforms, namely the Musketeers of the Royal House.\n\nWhilst the Swiss Guard has served us well, bolstering our numbers by integrating the Musketeers and the average French peasant into our forces and having a sizable contingent of our French conscripts join the Swiss Guard would be an excellent use of the resources freshly made available by our campaigns.."
 ME_Papal_Events.15.a: "They will serve the Pope now"

 ME_Papal_Events.16.t: "New Holy Orders"
 ME_Papal_Events.16.d: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur et ante enim. Curabitur porttitor urna in consequat elementum. Nunc eu finibus elit, ac lobortis magna.

 ME_Papal_Events.16.a: "Great!"

 ME_Papal_Events.17.t: "Fate of the Reformation"
 ME_Papal_Events.17.d: "In the face of the Reformation, the Pope, [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] has opted to start drafting a Papal Bull, due to our hesistance to remotely compromise the Pope's authority to negiotate with kings and reformers. Whilst this bypasses the College of Cardinals entirely, they will surely understand in due time that this was the right plan, for any Council would have done nothing but chip away at the holiness of the Catholic Church and anger these so-called reformers... especially if it had been held in a city within the Holy Roman Empire like the Emperor has repeatedly requested, like Trent.\n\nAs such, there are two overarching stances regarding this Reformation that can be taken as to attempt to secure peace and order. The Pope is indeed infailable, so it may be wise to enforce the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome and deny these men anything but the edge of our swords. However, this would more than likely plunge the continent into chaos in the mean time, so it may be wiser to concede some ground to the Lutherans and Calvinists in order to hopefully make states following these faiths accept the Pope as God's representative on Earth once more."
 ME_Papal_Events.17.a: "They will be converted through the sword"
 ME_Papal_Events.17.b: "As the Habsburgs once said..."

 ME_Papal_Events.18.t: "A Demand of Annexation"
 ME_Papal_Events.18.d: "The Holy See has been undergoing efforts to stem the autonomy of fiefdoms under their suzerainity, and whilst we have tried to appease them time and time again, we have wound up now being their next target, for a Papal legate has arrived demanding we surrender much of our privileges to the Vatican.\n\nWhilst this means that our rulers will effectively be reduced to governors whom recieve little of the revenues of the lands they themselves govern, we don't exactly have much of a choice in the matter."
 ME_Papal_Events.18.a: "We are their vassals after all"
 ME_Papal_Events.18.b: "Never!"

 ME_Papal_Events.19.t: "Pax Romana - Addressing the Factionalism in Rome"
 ME_Papal_Events.19.d: "As the days where the Pope had supreme temporal authority fade rapidly into the abyss, the power one family has if they sway the College of Cardinals has rapidly began to become limited to just our holdings, and matters of secular authority have increasingly began to matter more to the Pope, who now has to fight tooth and nail for any shred of power and influence they can get.\n\nIn this political climate, the feud between the Orsini and Colonna family is more so a nuisance than a fact of life, and with much of the College of Cardinals being truly loyal only to the Pope and the Pope alone, perhaps we can now put down the feud at last and force the two families to reconcile... or perhaps we may benefit more from playing them off eachother."
 ME_Papal_Events.19.a: "Their dispute will end now"
 ME_Papal_Events.19.b: "They can still keep fighting for power, as long as they benefit us"

 ME_Papal_Events.20.t: "Swinging the Balance of Power"
 ME_Papal_Events.20.d: "With the institutionalization of nepotism within the Vatican as a tool for the Pope to assert their power, there is now increasingly a power base which can be leverged to sway the opinions of the College of Cardinals in one direction or another. This has opened up a great opportunity to sway opinion of the two main feuding families within the Vatican in a direction favorable to us."
 ME_Papal_Events.20.a: "Aid the Orsini"
 ME_Papal_Events.20.b: "Support the Colonna"
 ME_Papal_Events.20.c: "I've changed my mind"

 ME_Papal_Events.21.t: "Indulgences Profit"
 ME_Papal_Events.21.d: "When the Papacy began considerations of turning the abuse of indulgences into part of the institution itself, they quickly dismissed the idea of making it into something only the Papacy could engage in and left it as something for all Bishops under the Bishop of Rome to engage in, as long as they are given their rightful share of the profits. As such, with us having sold an indulgence to a major political leader, we are now expected to hand out a considerable amount of the wealth to the [PAP.GetName]."
 ME_Papal_Events.21.a: "Money talks"

 ME_Papal_Events.22.t: "Contacting the Crusader Remnants"
 ME_Papal_Events.22.d: "With us establishing cordial relations with the remaining crusader states in Rhodes and Cyprus, we have been able to ensure that these states, reduced to strongholds in the Aegean, are strong enough to fight back against those who may seek to destroy them once and for all. Now, we must consider how we intend to proceed with these relations going forward. These Holy Orders are de jure directly under our suzerainity, and with them now being aligned with us, it would not be too much of a push to attempt to get them to de facto acknowledge who their suzerain is."
 ME_Papal_Events.22.a: "We shall contact them"
 ME_Papal_Events.22.b: "They're more trouble than they're worth"


 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.1.t: "Orsini Bribes"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.1.d: "With increasing influence of the Orsini family in Vatican politics, they naturally also seek to steer our policy into a direction favorable to them. Whilst they cannot directly make policy on their own, they do have many a tool to attempt to steer it in their favor regardless.\n\nAs such, the Orisinis have sent an offer to send over to us some men capable to being used for many a project, be it war or construction efforts, if we just make some adjustments to our policies to favor them and only them..."
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.1.a: "What harm would a little corruption do?"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.1.b: "I see right through this trick"

 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.2.t: "Colonna Family 'Aids' Us"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.2.d: "With increasing influence of the Colonna family in Vatican politics, they naturally also seek to steer our policy into a direction favorable to them. Whilst they cannot directly make policy on their own, they do have many a tool to attempt to steer it in their favor regardless.\n\nAs such, the Colonnas have sent an offer to send over of us some of their treasury capable to being used for many a project, be it war or construction efforts, if we just make some adjustments to our policies to favor them and only them..."
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.2.a: "Money before faith"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.2.b: "We will not accept bribes"

 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.3.t: "Border Dispute"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.3.d: "As to be expected with any feud between families, some petty squabbles regarding the borders of their fiefdoms have arisen between the Orsini and Colonna families. Whilst the land disputed in [border_dispute_province.GetName] is but a few acres and is largely under the control of a foreign power, it seems that these maddened nobles may take up arms against eachother over but one lord's farmlands!\n\nWe must make a clear stance on whom these lands properly belong to, for the Orsini have taken direct action and raided their rival's lands!"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.3.a: "The Orsini Family is not to be blamed"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.3.b: "We will bring the culprits to justice"

 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.4.t: "City Aided By the Colonna Family"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.4.d: "The Colonna family, as one of the newer infuential families within the Vatican, have many ties to the merchants and artisans whom are well experienced with matters relating to infrastructure. As such, they have started investing into one of the cities under our reign, [colonna_dev_province.GetName], as a symbol of their goodwill towards the Holy See. Whilst these efforts are active, they are barely underway and would require considerable investment from us to finish the work that they have started.\n\nThis is an obvious ploy by the Colonnas to attempt to sway our favor towards them, but is it really a good idea to deny their offer?"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.4.a: "Let them invest into it"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.4.b: "It is not their city"

 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.5.t: "Disputes in Rome"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.5.d: "Recently, representatives of the Orsini and Colonna families have been caught in a debate over a relatively small issue of policy that, nonetheless, appears to be extremely important to both of these influential families, for the debates have gone from civil affairs into brutal brawls of words, and, rarely, swords and guns. Already, minor bouts of chaos have begun to spill out upon the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName], and if we do nothing, it is likely that this violence will only grow worse as the factions grow more entrenched in their stances on this petty issue.\n\nShall we side with the Orsini and acquire the ire of the Colonna, give aid to the Colonna and anger the Orsini, or pay no mind, let the dispute bleed itself out, and just pray we can ignore it?"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.5.a: "The Orsini have our aid"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.5.b: "The Colonna are to be defended"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.5.c: "Try to maintain a status quo"

 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.6.t: "Heated Debates"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.6.d: "A group of Cardinals have gotten into a rather hostile debate as of late regarding specific policies within the Holy See, and, as is to be expected with the politics as of late, the cardinals in question are either bought by a variety of means or directly related to the feuding Orsini and Colonna families. Naturally, they refuse to compromise, and this has begun to tear the Holy See asunder as vile words are flung and men barely hold themselves back from engaging in sinful violence.\n\nIt is expected for us to side with one of the powerful clans in order to make the debate cease, but is this truly a wise idea?"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.6.a: "The Colonna Family has a point...."
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.6.b: "I like what the Orsini are saying"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.6.c: "Both of them speak nonsense"

 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.7.t: "High Orsini Influence"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.7.d: "After much manuvering amongst themsleves, the Orsini have manage to ascend to the heights of Papal politics, for now the Colonna and other groups of Cardinals are unable to counter the whims of this one family. Now, not even the Pope is truly able to keep them at check, and as such, corruption has began to grow rampant as the Orsini influence policy to be exclusively in their favor.\n\nWith the Orsini isolating many a house and demanding resources be granted to them regardless of need or use, the damage has already been done for the foreseeable future.

 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.8.d: "Embezzlement runs rampant in the Holy See now that the Orsini have a grapplehold on internal politics.

 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.100.t: "Factionalism in Rome"
 ME_Papal_Factionalism_Events.100.d: "For centuries now, the Colonna and Orsini families, integral parts of the Papal nobility and influencers of our policy, have been in a bitter power struggle for supremacy within the Vatican. Whilst both claim descent from Emperors Augustus and Claudius of ancient Rome, the trajectories the families have gone down have diverged greatly, and now their petty feud poses a major threat to the efforts of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to centralize their rule and exert their divinely-appointed authority over all of Catholicism.\n\nThe Orsinis are the 'older' of the two feuding families in regards to their influence within the Vatican, as from them five former Popes have stemmed from. As a result of their influence in the past, the Orsinis have been granted sizable lands as their personal fiefdom, namely lands within Naples, and the Duchy of Bracciano alongside surrounding lands not too far north of the current residence of the Holy See. Their influence was once so great that they succeeded in exiling the Colonna. However, the Colonna aligned with the Kings of France and would find themselves restored to the Holy See during the Avignon Papacy following a failed attempt to arrest Pope Boniface VIII in 1303.\n\nMeanwhile the Colonnas have only began to acquire great influence in recent years, but have used the two centuries since their exile well. With their return to the Papacy, they spread their influence far and wide, with many a Cardinal being from their lineage. Notably, Cardinal Egidio Colonna became one of the most important thinkers of his time, having studied the divine in Paris under Saint Thomas of Aquinas. Their influence grew so great that they even acquired the privilege of using the Imperial crown upon their coat of arms after an incident involving Louis IV of Germany and Pope John XII's refusal to crown him. However, this was not the height of their influence, as at the Council of Constance in 1417, they had one of their own elected as head of the Catholic Church, Martinus V. Whilst Martinus V has ascended to the Kingdom of Heaven since then, the influence the family gained under his tenure still persists, with the Orsini arguably being pushed towards the shadows more and more day by day.\n\nHowever, the Orsini will not just stand by forever and let their influence decay, and it is expected that the power struggle between the families will persist for the forseeable future... unless we intervene and secure peace in Rome once and for all."
