# European Choice Mission
# Event for nations in Europe that are very close to Occitania (if they still exist) which gives them a choice to become Cathar. Most choose to because of promixity to Occitania and the general influence of the Cathar religion. In general the nations are worried but not just because of the religion change but because of how powerful Occitania is becoming.
