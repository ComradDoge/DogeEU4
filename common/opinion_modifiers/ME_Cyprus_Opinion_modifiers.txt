#name_of_modifier = {
#    opinion = 1		# the value that the modifier has at start (this is the non optional part)

#    max = 15			# the same as "min", but for the maximum (positive) value
#    yearly_decay = 5	# the value of which the opinion is changed towards 0 every year. So if you have a =5 the modifier will got 5 towards 0 every year (if positive opinion - decrease, if negative - increase). If the modifier value is at 0, the opinion is removed automatically
#    months = 10		# defines the time that the modifier will be active, e.g. if an opinion is added that has months = 12, it will stay for 1 year (unless the opinion reaches 0 before). After the year, it is removed automatically
