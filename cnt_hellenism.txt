Sol Invictus Mechanics



How Sol Invictus Works
    180/190/200 tiers provide unrest and other modifiers as you are not making use of the population zeal (church power) and so they turn against you.
    Sol Invictus gets a cb for converting others to hellenism_pagan (there can only be one sol invictus)
    Being at war with other hellenics will result in -100% church power + some other bad modifiers



    Option to put down the mantle and no longer lead Sol Invictus and all provinces and country turn to Hellenic

92 = 3months
