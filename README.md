# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

1.32 
- Any Shattered changes to concentrate development turned off and now using vanilla changes instead 
- Mali and Ethiopia shattered missions will appear if you don't have Origins DLC, otherwise Origins missions will appear

General
- Lumber price event added
- Decision religious icons changed
- Nationalist estate disaster added
- Government Tab reworked (Artemis UI)
- Humanist advisor mechanic slightly reworked
- Goods Info Panel separated for future proofing
- Added Bosporan, Etruria and Czechoslovakia formable
- Decision to show where you are lacking resources for factories
- Exclusive ideas are now fully color coded instead of asterisks
- Added 5 Irish colonial names (Canada, America, Louisian, Mexico, Carribean)
- Triangle Trade increases slave price 50%>100% and abolition event decreases -40%>-50%
- Added Abolish Slavery CB (PTE), World Revolution CB for Peasants Republic and PRC reform
- Due finnicky stuff, latent buildings that use resources can only be built one at a time. In exchange time to build them was reduced 24>12 months

- Policies have been fully reworked and have little simillarity to previous version. The policies have certain type of logic in the premise of single modifiers and set policies with two modifiers. There have been modifiers that were completely removed and will not be making a comeback, while some might. Compared to previous, a few more policies are limited to a maximum of two policies. A more important part of the policies however is that there is now an image of it with all combinations, so yes you can stop pestering me for it. By the way, I am always open for better names for policies as my brain went numb thinking of them after a while.

- Almost all ideas have been touched in some form or shape so don't blindly pick them based on 1.31 information. Most are not drastic changes when compared to State Management or Tactical who have become Trade Management and Logistics respectively. Nonetheless its different enough when taking in account all ideas and policy change.
-  Dictatorship idea has been removed, the memey decision event mechanic that was tied to it is now just tied to any dictatoship = yes government reform

Balance
- Maximum priviledges 8>6
- Three T7 Reforms rebalanced
- Absolutism: discipline 5%>7.5%
- Monument T1 cost reduced 2.5k > 1k
- Government building values tweaked
- ADM/DIP/MIL point priviledges removed
- State Edict: maintenance increase 0.5 > 1
- Latent building governing_cost tweaked 10%/20%/30%
- Government building governing_cost reductions reduced
- Global Trade: spreading will no longer get a boost from just having printing press


Fixes
- Cheese added to goods info page
- Carthage: dominate Genoa mission
- Zapadoslavia army decision with wrong modifier
- Goods Info Event follows same order as in macrobuilder
- Dal naval supplies switched to fish since its landlocked
- Slavery Abolition decision will appear in Enlightenment Age
- UI: Backdrop behind Naval engagement width and slightly more compact
- Fortress: 2nd idea missing localisation for ability to refill garrison
- Cleaned up a bunch of reform mentioning "Allow X Idea group" that meant nothing
- Hovering over North Sea Empire decision requirements will no longer lag you out
- Republican Mercenary Corps mechanic uses the same as Monarchy Mercenary Corps reform
- Mercenary Corps foreign_experts mechanic nation requires to be at least 25 development

The mod is a general overhaul of the game, focusing on a shattered setting, with lots of content in government reforms; formables; religions; trade and much more. While also ensuring a balanced game for both single-player and multi-player and fixing various issues whether it be AI or lack of QoL.

The mod is definitely more than just a shattered map, if you dislike that there is a much more toned down version you can download by clicking on the banner.

[h1] Credits [/h1]
[quote]Credit to all the authors of mods that I have incorporated into Shattered. This is especially the case for flogi (Idea Variation Mod), Expanded Mods family, ArtemisFowl for understanding EU4 UI and Viking_Nephilim for religious work

Not all parts of the mods will be added or without changes which is why you see differences from their mod version and mine. I'll try to credit people and link to their workshop cause their work saves my time and it would be rude not too.[/quote]
