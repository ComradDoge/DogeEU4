# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

- Policies completely reworked from the ground up. Now every combo* has a policy like in vanilla (*with some exceptions due to some limitations). This means there are 491 policies in total. For comparison, vanilla has 203. Albeit some are repeating due to the scope.
- There is now a UI button in game (top right of decisions tab) to see a table of policy combinations.
- The policies can also be viewed in a spreadsheet located here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UVH9Ju7uHwZhNgV_I_qliV4MXHAhFfGj7bFXS_BSsZg/edit?usp=sharing


- Heavenly Kingdom (China Formable) slightly reworked.
- Internal file cleanup for some performance improvements.
- Added back At-Cap Auto-Development button in decisions screen.
- Mercenary maintenance cost per technology 0.08 > 0.1 increase.
- Mercenary manpower reserve pool lowered (define value 2.0 > 1.0).
- Yearly_crruption in ideas lowered 0.1 > 0.05 to increase it's value elsewhere.
- Extra cost when over forcelimit define slightly reduced, Land: 6>4; Navy: 8>6.
- Fixed Druidic Woodland Stewardship mechanic literally not being enabled (lmao).
- Added Overseas CB to Exploration as the colonial primitive one imo is too useless.

# TODO

# solution for ai desire to max out forcelimit at expense of manpower
# at some point add the idea events to anbennar/vanilla kek

The mod is a general overhaul of the game, focusing on a shattered setting, with lots of content in government reforms; formables; religions; trade and much more. While also ensuring a balanced game for both single-player and multi-player and fixing various issues whether it be AI or lack of QoL.
