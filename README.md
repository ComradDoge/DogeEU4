# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

- Byzantine missions tree accepts Sol Invictus for triggers
- Religion icons cleaned up, changed and just overall better.
- African missions with cult unlock requirements changed
- African missions with only shamanism religion trigger now accept all african_pagan religions
- Korean monument fixes regarding culture and religion triggers
- All monuments start at T0. Those that did exist in the timeframe are merely not counted as built up monuments until you 'better' them with your grace. thonk
- The reformation should be much slower. Hopefully. Hopefully not too slow either. I am sure you'll tell me.
- Removed a good chunk of global_unrest reductions in government reforms as the modifier bloat has made it inconsequantial

The mod is a general overhaul of the game, focusing on a shattered setting, with lots of content in government reforms; formables; religions; trade and much more. While also ensuring a balanced game for both single-player and multi-player and fixing various issues whether it be AI or lack of QoL.

The mod is definitely more than just a shattered map, if you dislike that there is a much more toned down version you can download by clicking on the banner.

[h1] Credits [/h1]
[quote]Credit to all the authors of mods that I have incorporated into Shattered. This is especially the case for flogi (Idea Variation Mod), Expanded Mods family, ArtemisFowl for understanding EU4 UI and Viking_Nephilim for religious work

Not all parts of the mods will be added or without changes which is why you see differences from their mod version and mine. I'll try to credit people and link to their workshop cause their work saves my time and it would be rude not too.[/quote]
