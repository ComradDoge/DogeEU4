# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
- [The Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2152606065)

- Version: 1.37.2
- Checksum: ?

<h1>00/00/2024</h1>
- Cleaned up some decision and modifier icons.
- Added missing NWC/NVC ideas and other fixes to them.
- Norway mission that allows earlier formation of Scandinavia....now allows it.
- Reforms that had harmonization modifiers extended to other religions that use that mechanic instead of only confucianism.
- Got rid of background events that basically force reformation and replaced with a single flavour event that can fire after 1517 in Wittenberg which gives 200% reform desire but only once.
- Added a Special setting "MP Disable Mission Trees". Note that cause of how it's implemented (overlays UI over it) it only disallows the players, AI is still capable of interacting with them however it's AI so its not as effective. Nonetheless, this setting is more for multiplayer rather than both.

# - Added a Special setting "Ignore Formable Subject Requirement" which as the name suggests allows your subjects to form nations if the meet all the other requirements. If I am missing a formable just report it.

The mod is a general overhaul of the game, focusing on a shattered setting, with lots of content in government reforms; formables; religions; trade and much more. While also ensuring a balanced game for both single-player and multi-player and fixing various issues whether it be AI or lack of QoL.
