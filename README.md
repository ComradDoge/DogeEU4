<h1>00/00/2024</h1>

- 1.37.3 Update.


 <!-- Todo -->
 <!-- 25% Movement Speed > 50% (25% is still good as you will annoy the shit out another player and save your army but 50% might just be persuasive enough, at least temp, to use a mil slot) -->
 <!-- Manpower global/recovery 10%>15% (a little bit more manpower as a treat) -->
 <!-- 9+ goods_produced_modifier monuments made to require respective goods, so no latent good shenanigans (dalaskogen, schwaz, golconda, poyang) -->

 <!-- Add Kok_armenia, mission choice  -->

The mod is a general overhaul of the game, focusing on a shattered setting, with lots of content in government reforms; formables; religions; trade and much more. While also ensuring a balanced game for both single-player and multi-player and fixing various issues whether it be AI or lack of QoL.
