# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

Content
- Advisors have been fully cleaned up and can be checked on the mod wiki. There are now a total of 36 advisors. 21 Vanilla and 15 new ones. The new ones also have their own respective one-time events simillar to vanilla.
- Mercenery companies maximum amount of regiment set to 40. Mercenary companies are now comprised of a single unit instead of a weird mishmash.
- Pontifex decision completely reworked. If a Byzantine or Italian restores it Hellenics and even Catholics get CB to take over the position. The position provides a bonus and an Introspection mechanic allowing you tp remove a bad trait every 5 years of your own choosing.
- Getting Hellenism changed and Sol Invictus added to as a 'leader' of Hellenism. 
- Sol Invictus: an aspect system which gives you very powerful bonuses at the cost of church power but they last for a short time so time them well. A CB that allows you to convert others to Hellenism (not Sol Invictus because you are special) and make them into a Hellenic Tributary.
- 10 more dutch monuments

Balance
- Mercenary Ideas: last idea gives you 5 mercenary groups (2inf, 2cav, 1art) with preset modifiers and a cap of 40.
- Increased effect of blockading on lowering the recruitment of troops and ships (-25% and -50%)
- Dayawism now has access to Syncretic faith mechanic and slightly buffed its religion modifier
- Rhineland got an additional -5% regiment cost and +5% manpower in its ideas
- Global unrest reduction removed from monuments and tolerance numbers reduced
- All advisor privileges have been removed, they may come back in the future.
- Good chunk of "interest per annum" sources lowered.

Fixes + Other
- Fixed a bunch of missing cores in the vanilla flavour bookmark
- Kongo Origin 4th mission requirement tweaked to not require a privilege that does not exist
- Breton, Welsh and Cornish are in their original respective culture groups to help ease the conquest of the region they are in.
- Mod units that appeared at tech 33-40 removed, in exchange other bonuses upped in those techs for funsies if you get to that point. German techgroup is also no longer in use until I think of something more interesting.
- Estate privilege UI slightly updated and estate icons made smaller to focus on the numbers instead

The mod is a general overhaul of the game, focusing on a shattered setting, with lots of content in government reforms; formables; religions; trade and much more. While also ensuring a balanced game for both single-player and multi-player and fixing various issues whether it be AI or lack of QoL.

The mod is definitely more than just a shattered map, if you dislike that there is a much more toned down version you can download by clicking on the banner.

[h1] Credits [/h1]
[quote]Credit to all the authors of mods that I have incorporated into Shattered. This is especially the case for flogi (Idea Variation Mod), Expanded Mods family, ArtemisFowl for understanding EU4 UI and Viking_Nephilim for religious work

Not all parts of the mods will be added or without changes which is why you see differences from their mod version and mine. I'll try to credit people and link to their workshop cause their work saves my time and it would be rude not too.[/quote]
