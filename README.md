# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

- Version: 1.35.2

- Vanilla Flavour core setup tweaked/fixed by Dzoni.
- Prussia religion requirement removed. Why? Chaos.
- The script that make sures all rulers have 3/3/3 at game start will also trigger if you have 0 somewhere. Oops.
- Bunch of mission setup tweaking. For example, if you have Domination DLC and start Vanilla Flavour as Ottomans, you will have the new mission tree. If you don't you will have whatever was prior. Due to the nature of the mission tree, it will not exist in the Shattered Bookmark. In other cases, such as French mission tree, no matter which bookmark you play on, if you have the DLC, you will have the new mission tree. If you don't then you will get whatever was prior to that and accessible to all/most. This kind of work will continue. Some missions might still need work to properly adapt to new systems.
- Government reform screen expanded and no longer crashes. In time some reforms might be removed/consolidated/moved since there is just so damn many.

The mod is a general overhaul of the game, focusing on a shattered setting, with lots of content in government reforms; formables; religions; trade and much more. While also ensuring a balanced game for both single-player and multi-player and fixing various issues whether it be AI or lack of QoL.

The mod is definitely more than just a shattered map, if you dislike that there is a much more toned down version you can download by clicking on the banner.

<h1>Credits</h1>
Credit to all the authors of mods that I have incorporated into Shattered. This is especially the case for flogi (Idea Variation Mod), Expanded Mods family, ArtemisFowl for understanding EU4 UI and Viking_Nephilim for religious work

Not all parts of the mods will be added or without changes which is why you see differences from their mod version and mine. I'll try to credit people and link to their workshop cause their work saves my time and it would be rude not too.
