# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

# DOCUMENTATION

Various areas of the code (scripted stuff) are signed with "#Code Project Name" so it is easier to find later, here will be a list of them if I am not lazy.

Additionally, this area will have changes to various small values, mostly in defines but for the most part its easier for interested people to just go to those files directly and check the changes.

---------------------------------------------------------
- "#Colonial Region Lock" for changes that blocks colonies from colonizing outside regions until independent
- Localisation and province_names has New World Province Localisation mod import.
- Due to being a goof, DST and DSE are Doge Shattered Europe related prefix


# LORE

Macaronesia MCR - A combination of portuguese and morrocans settlers (due to major cities on the coast). Benefit for the country is to have accepted cultures of both port and mor, but being its own culture too.

[h1] LITE VERSION [/h1]
This mod is my take on Shattered and if you wish for mainly a shattered world without the major changes I cut out the stuff and uploaded in the mod below.
Click [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2248615338] here [/url] for the LITE version of the mod.

[h1] Credits [/h1]
Credit to all the authors of mods that I have incorporated into Shattered. This is especially the case for flogi (Idea Variation Mod), Expanded Mods family who have done amazing work on eu4 and ArtemisFowl for understanding EU4 UI.

Reminder that not all parts of the mods will be added or without changes which is why you see differences from their mod and mine. I'll try to credit people and link to their workshop cause their work saves my time and it would be rude not too.
