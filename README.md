# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

- Wiki is now housed in https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Doge_Shattered_Europa and completely redone.

- Tweaked advisor one-time event modifiers/bonuses.
- Dynastic Ideas removed/disabled to allow for 13/13/13 total idea groups.
- Added Teutonic Order Lions of the North mission tree if you have the DLC.
- Advisor one-time events modifier duration changed from 6 years to 10 years.
- Champagne no longer exists on the map and is just wine, also added a bit more wine.
- Indigenous Ideas are now counted as government type ideas and therefore part of ADM category.
- Disabled most Japanese formables except the standard Japan and Ikko Ikki due to them not providing due to lack of identity.
#- Jewish proper replaced Samaritan/Karaite due to having a more interesting mechanic than standard deity system.
#- Policies completely reworked due to the issue of some idea combinations having five policies while others none. I don't know what I was under that night that I made them. Eitherway, this means there is X amount of policies, compared to vanillas Y. God forbid I ever do this again.

The mod is a general overhaul of the game, focusing on a shattered setting, with lots of content in government reforms; formables; religions; trade and much more. While also ensuring a balanced game for both single-player and multi-player and fixing various issues whether it be AI or lack of QoL.
