# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

- Wiki is now housed in https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Doge_Shattered_Europa and completely redone and expanded.

#-Added a bunch of new Dutch content from "Dutch Domination" by Petrus.

Major
- Trade good prices tweaked and a bunch of change up for latent goods.
- Rebalanced a bunch of religion country/syncretic modifiers, check wiki.
- Added Teutonic Order Lions of the North mission tree if you have the DLC.
- Dynastic Ideas removed/disabled to allow for 13/13/13 total idea groups and preparing for policy rework.
- Added missions for Assyria, Macedon and Aegyptus. Missions made by Chewyshoot from "Ancients Reborn" mod.
- Printed more money into the economy by having all nations earn 1 ducat each month more at game starts (24 ducats per year > 36 ducats per year).
- Heavily nerfed the amount of warscore that is increased by great projects. This will help with high warscore cost provinces as the game goes on.
- Policy numbers have been tweaked and are now in a more experimental phase, primarily as test ground for the complete rework in the works.

Minor
- Reduced the price of Canal Projects.
- Reenabled Brazil formation decision.
- Tweaked advisor one-time event modifiers/bonuses.
- Lowered the amount of loyalty estate interactions give.
- Some religion colour tweaks to have semi-cohesive colour scheme.
- Added Nestorian to religion ideas converter for most likely religions.
- Harmony modifiers tweaked, split the pagan groups modifiers, check wiki.
- Advisor one-time events modifier duration changed from 6 years to 10 years.
- Champagne good no longer exists on the map and is just wine, also added a bit more wine.
- Buffed Siberian development cost reduction -25%>-50% to negate the arctic climate negative.
- Indigenous Ideas are now counted as government type ideas and therefore part of ADM category.
- Fixed Northern German Confederation not getting some government mechanics (if you have the DLC).
- Fixed some religions not having/working rebels that allow you to change religion if you do it through them.
- Jewish proper replaced Samaritan/Karaite due to having a unique mechanic while the others being false choices taking up space.
- Various modifiers got tweaked and touched upon, for example: mercenary manpower, cav_to_inf_ratio, infantry/cavalry combat abilities.
- Disabled most Japanese formables except the standard Japan and Ikko Ikki due to them not providing much due to lack of identity and being general clutter. Might rework them later.
