# DOGE SHATTERED EUROPA
Initially this was just me goofing around and trying to make small stuff. At some point I just decided let's make a shattered
mod considering it has been dead for a long time. The mod itself will have bits and bobs from other mods, especially from the Expanded Mod family.
Also some AI logic and difficulty increase from excelmakesbelhappy although will see how those will work, considering it was made for a vanilla map.

Nonetheless, the goal is a shattered EU4 mod that takes up the reins of the original version by Neprut but also bit from Maxos if any.
I'll try to credit people as much as I can especially for major stuff. Although I will try to adapt them to shattered and most likely be different
from the original mod I took. After all I need to understand how they work, else the mod will be hard to update in the future for me.

# TODO
# Reintroduce caliphal legitimact in DoTF but make sure it doesnt crash people
# AFTER CAMPAIGN Centralization: move development_cost_modifier to the 25_dev_requirement. Replace it with -10% dev cost and reduce -30% to -20%. This prevents non_deved nation having an op modifier. 
# AFTER CAMPAIGN Manufactory dev bonus limited to production, forcelmit dev bonus to mil dev. Reduce scaling requirement to 5 for each.
